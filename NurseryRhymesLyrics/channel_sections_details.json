It is a way to explore emotions in a safe space, learn about relating to other people and about basic concepts such as vocabulary and counting.\n\nWe believe all kids should have access to good quality entertainment - regardless of geography, culture, background or abilities. This is why we are making our hugely popular kids show 'CoComelon' available to all kids in ASL.\n\nHaving a common cultural frame of reference is incredibly important for kids. And we are acutely aware that there is not currently the same abundance of content and choice available to kids who are deaf and hard-of-hearing, which other kids have. Which is why we are now signing our new content so that every kid, regardless of their abilities, can also enjoy and learn with CoComelon.\n\nLyrics:\n\nMy Mommy is the best, the best there ever was\nMy Mommy is the best, and I love her just because\nWhenever I am sick or hurt, she gives a great big kiss\nShe helps me to feel better and she does it just like this\n\nMy Mommy is the best, the best there ever was\nMy Mommy is the best, and I love her just because\nShe takes the time to play with me, all my favorite games\nEven when she‚Äôs busy, she loves me just the same\n\nMy Mommy is the best, the best there ever was\nMy Mommy is the best, and I love her just because\nWhenever I get hungry, she makes my favorite snacks\nShe makes them just the way I like, they‚Äôre great and that‚Äôs a fact\n\nYour Mommy is the best, the best there ever was\nYour Mommy is the best, and I love her just because\nShe laughs when I am silly, and likes to play along\nWe sing and dance together to all our favorite songs\n\nOur Mommy is the best, the best there ever was\nOur Mommy is the best, and we love her just because\nShe always takes good care of us, and she should be a queen\nShe‚Äôs the greatest mommy that we have ever seen\n\nI love to be your mommy\nReally?  It‚Äôs true!\nYou fill my life with lots of joy\nYou are my precious girl and boys\nReally?

Ready? Let‚Äôs Go!\nLet‚Äôs learn American Sign Language with the MyGos!\n\nLet‚Äôs Go - MyGo! is a new kids show from the creators of CoComelon for preschoolers, 2-5 years old. It‚Äôs a fun, music-filled show that normalizes and teaches kids American Sign Language (ASL). \n\nWatching good quality kids' shows can be a great support in a child's development. It is a way to explore emotions in a safe space, learn about relating to other people and about basic concepts such as vocabulary and counting.\n\nWe believe all kids should have access to good quality entertainment - regardless of geography, culture, background or abilities. This is why we are making our hugely popular kids show 'Blippi' available to all kids in ASL.\n\nHaving a common cultural frame of reference is incredibly important for kids. And we are acutely aware that there is not currently the same abundance of content and choice available to kids who are deaf and hard-of-hearing, which other kids have. Which is why we are now signing our new content so that every kid, regardless of their abilities, can also enjoy and learn with Blippi.\n\n#Blippi #ASL #SignLanguage #MyGo!",
