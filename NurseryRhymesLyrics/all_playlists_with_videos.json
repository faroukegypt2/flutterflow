It is a way to explore emotions in a safe space, learn about relating to other people and about basic concepts such as vocabulary and counting.\n\nWe believe all kids should have access to good quality entertainment - regardless of geography, culture, background or abilities. This is why we are making our hugely popular kids show 'CoComelon' available to all kids in ASL.\n\nHaving a common cultural frame of reference is incredibly important for kids. And we are acutely aware that there is not currently the same abundance of content and choice available to kids who are deaf and hard-of-hearing, which other kids have.

Let\u2019s watch them go! \nDown the road, around the tree!\nWho will win?  Just wait and see!\n\nAll the animals came down to see them run\nAll the animals came down to see them run\nWith a bell the race began\nAnd fast away the quick hare ran\nOh yes, the animals came down to see them run\n\nThe lagging tortoise very slowly crawled along\nThe lagging tortoise very slowly crawled along\nSince the hare so quickly sped,\nHe had by now run far ahead\nOh yes, the tortoise very slowly crawled along\n\nFast and slow, fast and slow!\nWho will win?  Let\u2019s watch them go! \nDown the road, around the tree!\nWho will win?  Just wait and see!\n\nThe speedy hare felt very sure that he would win\nThe speedy hare felt very sure that he would win\nSince he thought he couldn\u2019t lose,\nHe laid right down to take a snooze\nOh yes, the hare felt very sure that he would win\n\nThe little tortoise kept on inching down the road\nThe little tortoise kept on inching down the road\nHe passed by the sleeping hare,\nWho kept on snoring, unaware\nOh yes, the tortoise kept on inching down the road\n\nFast and slow, fast and slow!\nWho will win?  Let\u2019s watch them go! \nDown the road, around the tree!\nWho will win?  Just wait and see!\n\nDetermined Tortoise nearly reached the finish line\nDetermined Tortoise nearly reached the finish line\nThe sleepy hare woke up and ran\nAs fast as speedy quick hares can\nOh yes, the tortoise nearly reached the finish line\n\nYes it\u2019s true that slow and steady wins the race\nYes it\u2019s true that slow and steady wins the race\nOh yes the hare was very fast\nBut even so, he came in last\nOh yes it\u2019s true that slow and steady wins the race\n\nAbout Cocomelon:\n\nWhere kids can be happy and smart!\n\nAt Cocomelon, our goal is to help make learning a fun and enjoyable experience for kids by creating beautiful 3D animation, educational lyrics, and toe-tapping music. \n\nKids will laugh, dance, sing, and play along with our videos, learning letters, numbers, animal sounds, colors, and much, much more while simply enjoying our friendly characters and fun stories.\n\nWe also make life easier for parents who want to keep their kids happily entertained, giving you the peace of mind that your children are receiving quality educational content.
