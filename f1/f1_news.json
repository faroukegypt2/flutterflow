He has been with them since, through the titles of 2010-2013 and the years of Mercedes domination. He has seen every side of F1 and his judgment is sincere and invaluable.</p><p class=\"dcr-1i69m5j\">Yet the elephant in the room remains. It is just the car, isn&#8217;t it? The team are coasting, are they not? He smiles and considers it again. &#8220;Listen to the radio messages from Monaco,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Max said on Friday morning: &#8216;I am coming in, I am going to shunt if I carry on like this.&#8217; I don&#8217;t think it was even a raceable car at that point. So we changed it.</p><p class=\"dcr-1i69m5j\">&#8220;It&#8217;s race engineer, driver and the research tools at the factory. A team effort. It was nice to see us face that situation and there was no in-fighting, there was a discussion, it went in the right direction and when put it in the sweet spot, each practice was better, qualifying was acceptable, and the race was wonderful.&#8221;</p><p class=\"dcr-1i69m5j\">After an &#8220;acceptable&#8221; qualifying Verstappen took pole and then went on to win on a track that was least suited of all the races this season to the strengths of the Red Bull. An indication that their car was formidably potent but also that the team were able to adapt and react with skill and cohesion.</p><p class=\"dcr-1i69m5j\">For Pedals it was a further spur. &#8220;There was a combination of relief and pride. You take pride in it but the best thing we do is learn from it,&#8221; he says. It is a repeated refrain from a man who has been in the game his entire life but still takes nothing for granted, including this weekend at Silverstone, a home race for the team from Milton Keynes and a track very much suited to the Red Bull.</p><p class=\"dcr-1i69m5j\">&#8220;You never stop learning,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The car is evolving this weekend, every weekend. The great thing is they are prototypes, they are allowed to change and that&#8217;s what changes your competitive position. We are there to be shot at but we are here to try and protect our position, our competitive stance and we will do everything within our freedom to do so.&#8221;</p><p class=\"dcr-1i69m5j\">What about that never-before achieved clean sweep? Can it be done? Pedals smiles. As an engineer he does not want to be drawn into imponderables he cannot control but nonetheless he acknowledges it is within their compass.</p><p class=\"dcr-1i69m5j\">&#8220;Of course it is possible,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Each race is a new set of challenges, so be ready, be prepared, be thorough and let&#8217;s see where we finish. Sunday night in Abu Dhabi, you can ask me.&#8221;</p></div>",

He did so many drawings that the name stuck.\n\nSeven years followed in the design office before becoming trackside data engineer for David Coulthard, then a move to Benetton in 2000 where, as the team became Renault, he took on the new role as race engineer to two drivers who would become world champions, first Jenson Button, then Fernando Alonso.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Recap Free weekly newsletter The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend\u2019s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has been with them since, through the titles of 2010-2013 and the years of Mercedes domination. He has seen every side of F1 and his judgment is sincere and invaluable.\n\nYet the elephant in the room remains. It is just the car, isn\u2019t it? The team are coasting, are they not? He smiles and considers it again. \u201cListen to the radio messages from Monaco,\u201d he says. \u201cMax said on Friday morning: \u2018I am coming in, I am going to shunt if I carry on like this.\u2019 I don\u2019t think it was even a raceable car at that point. So we changed it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s race engineer, driver and the research tools at the factory. A team effort. It was nice to see us face that situation and there was no in-fighting, there was a discussion, it went in the right direction and when put it in the sweet spot, each practice was better, qualifying was acceptable, and the race was wonderful.\u201d\n\nAfter an \u201cacceptable\u201d qualifying Verstappen took pole and then went on to win on a track that was least suited of all the races this season to the strengths of the Red Bull. An indication that their car was formidably potent but also that the team were able to adapt and react with skill and cohesion.\n\nFor Pedals it was a further spur. \u201cThere was a combination of relief and pride. You take pride in it but the best thing we do is learn from it,\u201d he says. It is a repeated refrain from a man who has been in the game his entire life but still takes nothing for granted, including this weekend at Silverstone, a home race for the team from Milton Keynes and a track very much suited to the Red Bull.\n\n\u201cYou never stop learning,\u201d he says. \u201cThe car is evolving this weekend, every weekend. The great thing is they are prototypes, they are allowed to change and that\u2019s what changes your competitive position. We are there to be shot at but we are here to try and protect our position, our competitive stance and we will do everything within our freedom to do so.\u201d\n\nWhat about that never-before achieved clean sweep? Can it be done? Pedals smiles. As an engineer he does not want to be drawn into imponderables he cannot control but nonetheless he acknowledges it is within their compass.\n\n\u201cOf course it is possible,\u201d he says. \u201cEach race is a new set of challenges, so be ready, be prepared, be thorough and let\u2019s see where we finish. Sunday night in Abu Dhabi, you can ask me.\u201d",

Will he continue that complete control over the rest of the Formula 1 field at the 2023 British Grand Prix at the Silverstone Circuit on Sunday at 10 a.m. ET? He finished 20th and seventh in his last two British Grand Prix events, so there may be an opportunity for a new winner for the first time since April on Sunday.</p><p>Verstappen is the -450 favorite (risk $450 to win $100) in the 2023 British Grand Prix odds on Caesars Sportsbook. Englishman Lando Norris, who is sure to be a local favorite, follows Verstappen at +1000, with Charles Leclerq at +1600. Lewis Hamilton has +2000 odds to win his ninth British Grand Prix, while Sergio Perez is at +5000 after struggling in qualifying. Before analyzing the 2023 British Grand Prix starting grid and making any Formula 1 picks, <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2023-formula-1-schedule-f1-picks-odds-british-grand-prix-projected-leaderboard-start-time-race-prediction-from-top-model/#ttag=07062023_agg_cbssports_picks_autoracing_formula1_model_britishgrandprix\" target=\"_blank\">be sure to check out the latest 2023 British GP predictions and betting advice from SportsLine's proven projection model.</a></p><p>Developed by daily Fantasy pro and SportsLine predictive data engineer Mike McClure, this proprietary Formula 1 prediction model simulates every race 10,000 times, taking into account factors such as track history and recent results. It's had a strong history of success in motorsports, correctly predicting nine NASCAR winners since the 2021 season and its projected leaderboards have forecasted winners across multiple racing formats.</p><p>The model has been scorching hot when it comes to picking Formula 1 race events dating back to 2021. It nailed both of Charles Leclerc's wins in 2022, and at the 2021 Mexican Grand Prix, the model was strongly backing Verstappen as its top pick. The result: Verstappen dominated the field and ran away with a surprise victory.&#160;</p>\n        <p id=\"native_story_flex_top\" class=\"ad-native-story-flex-top \">\n    </p>\n\n    <p>The model followed that up by calling Verstappen's win at the Rolex Emilia Romagna GP in April and then nailed his wins again in Belgium, the Netherlands, Japan, the United States, Mexico and Abu Dhabi. It's also nailed Verstappen's wins in Bahrain, Australia, Miami, Monaco, Spain, Canada and Austria this season. Anyone who followed the model's lead on those plays has seen huge returns</p><p>Now, the model has dialed in on the 2023 Formula 1 British Grand Prix and just released its coveted picks and leaderboard projections. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2023-formula-1-schedule-f1-picks-odds-british-grand-prix-projected-leaderboard-start-time-race-prediction-from-top-model/#ttag=07062023_agg_cbssports_picks_autoracing_formula1_model_britishgrandprix\" target=\"_blank\">You can head to SportsLine now to see the complete 2023 British Grand Prix leaderboard projection.</a></p><h2>Top 2023 Formula 1 British GP predictions</h2><p>One massive shocker: The model is fading Leclerc even though he's coming off a season-best second-place finish in Austria and is listed as the third favorite. He has +1600 odds but is sixth in the 2023 Formula 1 standings, largely because of his inconsistent racing this season.</p>\n        <p id=\"gambling_partner\" class=\"ad-gambling-partner GamblingPartnerAd lazyload lazypreload\">\n    </p>\n\n    <p>Last weekend was his first runner-up in nine races this season, and he's winless in his last 20 races. Although he finished second in the Formula 1 standings last year, the 25-year-old hasn't built on that success at all. In fact, he's regressed with two finishes 19th or worse this season over just nine races after finishing 19th or worse three times last year in 22 races.

                            "text": "Max Verstappen has been absolutely dominant in the 2023 Formula 1 season and is coming off his fifth straight victory last week. Will he continue that complete control over the rest of the Formula 1 field at the 2023 British Grand Prix at the Silverstone Circuit on Sunday at 10 a.m. ET? He finished 20th and seventh in his last two British Grand Prix events, so there may be an opportunity for a new winner for the first time since April on Sunday.\n\nVerstappen is the -450 favorite (risk $450 to win $100) in the 2023 British Grand Prix odds on Caesars Sportsbook. Englishman Lando Norris, who is sure to be a local favorite, follows Verstappen at +1000, with Charles Leclerq at +1600. Lewis Hamilton has +2000 odds to win his ninth British Grand Prix, while Sergio Perez is at +5000 after struggling in qualifying. Before analyzing the 2023 British Grand Prix starting grid and making any Formula 1 picks, be sure to check out the latest 2023 British GP predictions and betting advice from SportsLine's proven projection model.\n\nDeveloped by daily Fantasy pro and SportsLine predictive data engineer Mike McClure, this proprietary Formula 1 prediction model simulates every race 10,000 times, taking into account factors such as track history and recent results. It's had a strong history of success in motorsports, correctly predicting nine NASCAR winners since the 2021 season and its projected leaderboards have forecasted winners across multiple racing formats.\n\nThe model has been scorching hot when it comes to picking Formula 1 race events dating back to 2021. It nailed both of Charles Leclerc's wins in 2022, and at the 2021 Mexican Grand Prix, the model was strongly backing Verstappen as its top pick. The result: Verstappen dominated the field and ran away with a surprise victory.\n\nThe model followed that up by calling Verstappen's win at the Rolex Emilia Romagna GP in April and then nailed his wins again in Belgium, the Netherlands, Japan, the United States, Mexico and Abu Dhabi. It's also nailed Verstappen's wins in Bahrain, Australia, Miami, Monaco, Spain, Canada and Austria this season. Anyone who followed the model's lead on those plays has seen huge returns\n\nNow, the model has dialed in on the 2023 Formula 1 British Grand Prix and just released its coveted picks and leaderboard projections. You can head to SportsLine now to see the complete 2023 British Grand Prix leaderboard projection.\n\nTop 2023 Formula 1 British GP predictions\n\nOne massive shocker: The model is fading Leclerc even though he's coming off a season-best second-place finish in Austria and is listed as the third favorite. He has +1600 odds but is sixth in the 2023 Formula 1 standings, largely because of his inconsistent racing this season.\n\nLast weekend was his first runner-up in nine races this season, and he's winless in his last 20 races. Although he finished second in the Formula 1 standings last year, the 25-year-old hasn't built on that success at all. In fact, he's regressed with two finishes 19th or worse this season over just nine races after finishing 19th or worse three times last year in 22 races. The model doesn't see value in his 16-1 odds, picking him to finish outside the top five on Sunday. See who else the model is backing and who it is fading right here.\n\nHow to make 2023 British Grand Prix picks\n\nThe model is also targeting one longshot getting triple-digit British GP odds to make a surprising surge up the leaderboard. Anyone who backs him could hit it big. You can find out who he is, and see all of the model's F1 picks and predictions at SportsLine.\n\nSo who wins the British Grand Prix 2023, and which under-the-radar drivers make a stunning charge toward the front?
