He will start from second place ahead of rookie team-mate Oscar Piastri, who leads the second row of the grid.\n\nMeanwhile, Mercedes managed a 6-7 result. George Russell pipped his seven-time champion stablemate Hamilton by 0.056s but the pair ended up over 0.4s adrift of the pace-setting RB19.\n\nHamilton revealed that he was not surprised by the result from McLaren, which has used the Silverstone weekend to introduce the second part of a three-stage upgrade package that team principal Andrea Stella reckons will change almost every aerodynamic part on the MCL60.\n\nAsked for his reaction to the McLaren showing, Hamilton said: \u201cNot surprised.

I would like to mention one name here, Peter Prodromou, who is leading the aerodynamic development at McLaren.</p>\n<p>&#8220;He is doing an exceptional job in terms of setting the conceptual direction, but also having organised and having inspired the entire aerodynamic group.&#8221;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>While incidents like the Red Bull floor being revealed at the Monaco Grand Prix have helped other teams understand more about what F1&#8217;s benchmark team is doing, Stella says that of greater importance is understanding why certain designs have been created in that way.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I'm sure all teams got inspiration from looking at the Red Bull car, like they get inspiration from all the photos that teams get off any other car,&#8221; he added.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Pretty much all teams have professional photographers that take as much opportunity [to get pictures] as possible, and this is inspiration.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I would detract off our aerodynamic department if I said: &#8216;Oh, yeah, we saw that and now we have the solution.&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You see it and you get some thoughts that maybe you can do this.

So, you do take inspiration from the other cars.\n\n\u201cBut taking inspiration, or even looking at the photo, doesn't mean that you copy the geometry, you install it in your CFD runs in the computer simulation or in the wind tunnel, and then the car lights up in terms of downforce.\n\n\u201cNormally what happens is it [the performance] goes down, because your car is already optimised around what you have done up until that point.\u201d\n\nLando Norris, McLaren MCL60, Oscar Piastri, McLaren MCL60, into the pit lane Photo by: Mark Sutton / Motorsport Images\n\nRather than directly copying others, Stella said that what teams needed to do was take on board others' outline concepts to then work out how they can open up development paths for their own car.\n\n\u201cThe key element is understanding that some concepts have more potential that will allow you to develop faster and for longer,\u201d added Stella.\n\n\u201cAnd here is where you need to have the right people at the right place. I would like to mention one name here, Peter Prodromou, who is leading the aerodynamic development at McLaren.\n\n\u201cHe is doing an exceptional job in terms of setting the conceptual direction, but also having organised and having inspired the entire aerodynamic group.\u201d\n\nWhile incidents like the Red Bull floor being revealed at the Monaco Grand Prix have helped other teams understand more about what F1\u2019s benchmark team is doing, Stella says that of greater importance is understanding why certain designs have been created in that way.\n\n\u201cI'm sure all teams got inspiration from looking at the Red Bull car, like they get inspiration from all the photos that teams get off any other car,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cPretty much all teams have professional photographers that take as much opportunity [to get pictures] as possible, and this is inspiration.\n\n\u201cI would detract off our aerodynamic department if I said: \u2018Oh, yeah, we saw that and now we have the solution.\u2019\n\n\u201cYou see it and you get some thoughts that maybe you can do this. But then you have to do your own job with your own iteration, otherwise you don't get to something that actually works.\u201d",

We made some really good improvements overnight. Frustrated to see we're only half a tenth from P3, that would have been an amazing result.\n\n\"But I felt happy with my lap. Lewis has been pushing me really hard all weekend, and I sort of stayed calm. It all came together on that last lap.

It\u2019s great for myself, but also for both of us, to be second and third, was pretty amazing for the whole team.\u201d\n\nNorris featured towards the top of the times throughout qualifying at Silverstone\n\nHaving endured a number of early-season struggles, home favourite Norris underlined just how important the standout performance is for himself, Piastri and the entire McLaren workforce. \u201cIt makes up for everything, you know,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the hard work that we\u2019ve been putting in, especially here, with the new livery, a home race for the team and for myself.\u201d READ MORE: \u2018It\u2019s all extra excitement\u2019 \u2013 Norris opens up on racing in front of his home crowd at \u2018mega, magical\u2019 Silverstone Norris then joked: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have had a better result today, apart from Max, again \u2013 he ruins everything! But the rest was pretty amazing, so a big thanks to everyone.\u201d Piastri, meanwhile, was able to join Norris at the sharp end \u2013 just a tenth further back \u2013 after taking on the upgrade package that his team mate debuted last time out in Austria.\n\nPiastri backed up Norris for the best grid slot of his F1 career so far",

That\u2019s one reason,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cThe second reason is track specific.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t perform in Barcelona, Austria and Silverstone. All three of them are a little bit similar in terms of track characteristics.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT?\n\nPre-race coverage starts at 10:30pm Sunday, with lights out for the British Grand Prix at midnight Monday morning.\n\n",

            "article_html": "<div><p>The 2023 British Grand Prix delivered the drama as Red Bull's Max Verstappen took his sixth race victory in succession.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>The Dutchman claimed top spot at Silverstone for the first time in his career as his team made it 11 wins in a row - a joint record in the sport alongside McLaren.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>From the off he was put under heavy pressure though as Briton Lando Norris passed him at the the start, much to the delight of a capacity crowd. The home favourite held out for five laps before Verstappen ultimately retook the lead and took the chequered flag.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>Norris himself equalled his best-ever result by coming home in P2, while Lewis Hamilton rounded out the podium places after he benefitted from a late safety car stoppage. It meant Hamilton's 14th podium finish at the British Grand Prix, the most of any driver at any track in the sport's history and it also made it two British drivers on the podium at Silverstone for the first time since 1999.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>Australian rookie and Norris' McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri finished in P4, his best race result to date as he continues to impress during his debut F1 campaign.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>George Russell, Sergio Perez, Fernando Alonso, Alex Albon, Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz all finished in the points as Silverstone delivered its usual excitement.&#160;</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Max, Lando and Lewis were so excited to celebrate... that they forgot about the trophy &#128514;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BritishGP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BritishGP</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/F1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#F1</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/D4ii9VXDDf\">pic.twitter.com/D4ii9VXDDf</a></p>\n&#8212; Formula 1 (@F1) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/F1/status/1678072921724706818?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 9, 2023</a></blockquote>\n \n\n<p><strong>MORE:&#160;<a href=\"https://www.sportingnews.com/uk/formula-1/news/f1-british-grand-prix-2023-predictions-odds-betting-tips/bbax6pf1sftgoq7vc98nore6\">F1 British Grand Prix predictions, odds, betting tips, best bets for 2023 race at Silverstone</a></strong></p>\n\n<h2>F1 2023 British Grand Prix results</h2>\n\n\n\n\n\t<strong>Position</strong>\n\t<strong>Driver</strong>\n\t<strong>Team</strong>\n\t<strong>Points</strong>\n\n\n\t<strong>1</strong>\n\tMax Verstappen\n\tRed Bull\n\t26\n\n\n\t<strong>2</strong>\n\tLando Norris\n\tMcLaren\n\t18\n\n\n\t<strong>3</strong>\n\tLewis Hamilton\n\tMercedes\n\t15\n\n\n\t<strong>4</strong>\n\tOscar Piastri\n\tMcLaren\n\t12\n\n\n\t<strong>5</strong>\n\tGeorge Russell\n\tMercedes\n\t10\n\n\n\t<strong>6</strong>\n\tSergio Perez\n\tRed Bull\n\t8\n\n\n\t<strong>7</strong>\n\tFernando Alonso\n\tAston Martin\n\t6\n\n\n\t<strong>8</strong>\n\tAlex Albon\n\tWilliams\n\t5\n\n\n\t<strong>9</strong>\n\tCharles Leclerc\n\tFerrari\n\t2\n\n\n\t<strong>10</strong>\n\tCarlos Sainz\n\tFerrari\n\t1\n\n\n\t<strong>11</strong>\n\tLogan Sargeant\n\tWilliams\n\t-\n\n\n\t<strong>12</strong>\n\tValtteri Bottas\n\tAlfa Romeo\n\t-\n\n\n\t<strong>13</strong>\n\tNico Hulkenberg\n\tHaas\n\t-\n\n\n\t<strong>14</strong>\n\tLance Stroll\n\tAston Martin\n\t-\n\n\n\t<b>15</b>\n\tZhou Guanyu\n\tAlfa Romeo\n\t-\n\n\n\t<b>16</b>\n\tYuki Tsunoda\n\tAlphaTauri\n\t-\n\n\n\t<b>17</b>\n\tNyck De Vries\n\tAlphaTauri\n\t-\n\n\n\t<b>DNF</b>\n\tPierre Gasly&#160;\n\tAlpine\n\t-\n\n\n\t<b>DNF</b>\n\tKevin Magnussen\n\tHaas\n\t-\n\n\n\t<b>DNF</b>\n\tEsteban Ocon\n\tAlpine\n\t-\n\n\n\n\n<h2>F1 British Grand Prix 2023 live updates, highlights: As it happens</h2>\n\n<p><strong>CHEQUERED FLAG:</strong>&#160;<strong>MAX VERSTAPPEN WINS THE 2023 BRITISH GRAND PRIX!!&#160;</strong>It's a sixth straight victory for the Red Bull driver who continues to close in on a third World Drivers' Championship title. British favourites Lando Norris and Lewis Hamilton round out the podium places.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 50:</strong>&#160;Two laps to go then and Verstappen is causing to a sixth straight victory with the added bonus of claiming the fastest lap. Norris is looking good for P2 whilst Hamilton looks likely to claim the final podium spot.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 48:</strong> Replays show that Stroll crashed into Gasly causing his damage. Not a neat move from the Canadian at all.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 46:</strong>&#160;In what could prove to be absolutely crucial, Norris breaks the DRS gap to Hamilton and he hunts down a P2 finish. Hamilton's used soft tyres seem to be struggling a bit now, could Piastri challenge him near the end of this race?&#160;</p>\n\n<p>Gasly is out of this race. It's a double DNF for Alpine at Silverstone!&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 44:</strong>&#160;It's a simply perfect move from Perez on Sainz. He produces the switch back and gets through. It goes from bad to even worse for Sainz on the same lap as both Albon and Leclerc pass him as well!&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 42:</strong>&#160;It's still Norris from Hamilton behind Verstappen in the battle for P2. The veteran is piling the pressure on now though, as too is his teammate Russell just behind in his fight to overtake Piastri.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 40:&#160;</strong>It's yet more stunning defence from Norris who blocks Hamilton perfectly. The crowd are absolutely loving this. DRS is now activated.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 39: </strong>We're back under green flag conditions and away we go! Verstappen gets away quickly but Norris and Hamilton are having a battle for the ages. The Mercedes man tries it round the outside down the back straight but Norris is having none of it.&#160;</p>\n\n \n \n\n<p><strong>SAFETY CAR:</strong>&#160;The camera cuts to the back straight and Magnussen's Haas car is on fire. It's a huge engine problem for the Danish driver! That could have come at the perfect time for Verstappen and Norris who will pit and save plenty of time. Race on!</p>\n\n<p>Hamilton is promoted up to P3 on used soft tyres at the expense of Piastri, Norris chooses the hards. Very interesting selections going on here.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 32:</strong>&#160;Russell overtakes Leclerc round the outside of Luffield. That was a lovely move and the British driver gives a hefty round of applause for his good work. Gasly pits which promotes Piastri up to P5.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>Still no pits for Verstappen and Norris..&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 30:</strong>&#160;The flurry of pit stops begin, starting with Russell and crucially he rejoins behind Leclerc which he won't be happy with.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>Piastri responds and it's a quick stop from the McLaren team. He comes back out well ahead of Leclerc.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 27:</strong>&#160;Ferrari must have heard me.. Sainz pits for his own set of hard tyres. Expect the Mercedes duo, amongst others, to respond shortly.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 26:</strong>&#160;The top order are seriously pushing their first set of tyres here as they wait to see if any rain will fall. Only Leclerc has pit from the top order, he gets past Stroll to jump into P11.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 23:</strong>&#160;Verstappen's lead in now up to 5.5 seconds. It's his to lose from here.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 21:</strong>&#160;Despite starting on soft tyres, Russell is still out there for now. A number of others have pit but he continues for the time being.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>Looking at how dark the skies are, expect rain sometime soon..&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 19:</strong>&#160;Leclerc pits! Under heavy pressure from Russell behind, the Ferrari man boxes for a set of hard tyres. That leaves their options open in terms of going to the end of this race if the weather allows.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 17:</strong>&#160;After his stunning P3 qualification finish yesterday, Piastri is putting together a lovely race performance here. Leclerc behind in P4 is now over four seconds adrift as the McLaren pair look to save their tyres for a while.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 15</strong>: Perez gets past Stroll to grab P11 as his recovery drive gets underway.

            "text": "The 2023 British Grand Prix delivered the drama as Red Bull's Max Verstappen took his sixth race victory in succession.\n\nThe Dutchman claimed top spot at Silverstone for the first time in his career as his team made it 11 wins in a row - a joint record in the sport alongside McLaren.\n\nFrom the off he was put under heavy pressure though as Briton Lando Norris passed him at the the start, much to the delight of a capacity crowd. The home favourite held out for five laps before Verstappen ultimately retook the lead and took the chequered flag.\n\nNorris himself equalled his best-ever result by coming home in P2, while Lewis Hamilton rounded out the podium places after he benefitted from a late safety car stoppage. It meant Hamilton's 14th podium finish at the British Grand Prix, the most of any driver at any track in the sport's history and it also made it two British drivers on the podium at Silverstone for the first time since 1999.\n\nAustralian rookie and Norris' McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri finished in P4, his best race result to date as he continues to impress during his debut F1 campaign.\n\nGeorge Russell, Sergio Perez, Fernando Alonso, Alex Albon, Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz all finished in the points as Silverstone delivered its usual excitement.\n\nMax, Lando and Lewis were so excited to celebrate... that they forgot about the trophy \ud83d\ude02#BritishGP #F1 pic.twitter.com/D4ii9VXDDf \u2014 Formula 1 (@F1) July 9, 2023\n\nMORE: F1 British Grand Prix predictions, odds, betting tips, best bets for 2023 race at Silverstone\n\nF1 2023 British Grand Prix results\n\nPosition Driver Team Points 1 Max Verstappen Red Bull 26 2 Lando Norris McLaren 18 3 Lewis Hamilton Mercedes 15 4 Oscar Piastri McLaren 12 5 George Russell Mercedes 10 6 Sergio Perez Red Bull 8 7 Fernando Alonso Aston Martin 6 8 Alex Albon Williams 5 9 Charles Leclerc Ferrari 2 10 Carlos Sainz Ferrari 1 11 Logan Sargeant Williams - 12 Valtteri Bottas Alfa Romeo - 13 Nico Hulkenberg Haas - 14 Lance Stroll Aston Martin - 15 Zhou Guanyu Alfa Romeo - 16 Yuki Tsunoda AlphaTauri - 17 Nyck De Vries AlphaTauri - DNF Pierre Gasly Alpine - DNF Kevin Magnussen Haas - DNF Esteban Ocon Alpine -\n\nF1 British Grand Prix 2023 live updates, highlights: As it happens\n\nCHEQUERED FLAG: MAX VERSTAPPEN WINS THE 2023 BRITISH GRAND PRIX!! It's a sixth straight victory for the Red Bull driver who continues to close in on a third World Drivers' Championship title. British favourites Lando Norris and Lewis Hamilton round out the podium places.\n\nLap 50: Two laps to go then and Verstappen is causing to a sixth straight victory with the added bonus of claiming the fastest lap. Norris is looking good for P2 whilst Hamilton looks likely to claim the final podium spot.\n\nLap 48: Replays show that Stroll crashed into Gasly causing his damage. Not a neat move from the Canadian at all.\n\nLap 46: In what could prove to be absolutely crucial, Norris breaks the DRS gap to Hamilton and he hunts down a P2 finish. Hamilton's used soft tyres seem to be struggling a bit now, could Piastri challenge him near the end of this race?\n\nGasly is out of this race. It's a double DNF for Alpine at Silverstone!\n\nLap 44: It's a simply perfect move from Perez on Sainz. He produces the switch back and gets through. It goes from bad to even worse for Sainz on the same lap as both Albon and Leclerc pass him as well!\n\nLap 42: It's still Norris from Hamilton behind Verstappen in the battle for P2. The veteran is piling the pressure on now though, as too is his teammate Russell just behind in his fight to overtake Piastri.\n\nLap 40: It's yet more stunning defence from Norris who blocks Hamilton perfectly. The crowd are absolutely loving this. DRS is now activated.\n\nLap 39: We're back under green flag conditions and away we go! Verstappen gets away quickly but Norris and Hamilton are having a battle for the ages. The Mercedes man tries it round the outside down the back straight but Norris is having none of it.\n\nSAFETY CAR: The camera cuts to the back straight and Magnussen's Haas car is on fire. It's a huge engine problem for the Danish driver! That could have come at the perfect time for Verstappen and Norris who will pit and save plenty of time. Race on!\n\nHamilton is promoted up to P3 on used soft tyres at the expense of Piastri, Norris chooses the hards. Very interesting selections going on here.\n\nLap 32: Russell overtakes Leclerc round the outside of Luffield. That was a lovely move and the British driver gives a hefty round of applause for his good work. Gasly pits which promotes Piastri up to P5.\n\nStill no pits for Verstappen and Norris..\n\nLap 30: The flurry of pit stops begin, starting with Russell and crucially he rejoins behind Leclerc which he won't be happy with.\n\nPiastri responds and it's a quick stop from the McLaren team. He comes back out well ahead of Leclerc.\n\nLap 27: Ferrari must have heard me.. Sainz pits for his own set of hard tyres. Expect the Mercedes duo, amongst others, to respond shortly.\n\nLap 26: The top order are seriously pushing their first set of tyres here as they wait to see if any rain will fall. Only Leclerc has pit from the top order, he gets past Stroll to jump into P11.\n\nLap 23: Verstappen's lead in now up to 5.5 seconds. It's his to lose from here.\n\nLap 21: Despite starting on soft tyres, Russell is still out there for now. A number of others have pit but he continues for the time being.\n\nLooking at how dark the skies are, expect rain sometime soon..\n\nLap 19: Leclerc pits! Under heavy pressure from Russell behind, the Ferrari man boxes for a set of hard tyres. That leaves their options open in terms of going to the end of this race if the weather allows.\n\nLap 17: After his stunning P3 qualification finish yesterday, Piastri is putting together a lovely race performance here. Leclerc behind in P4 is now over four seconds adrift as the McLaren pair look to save their tyres for a while.\n\nLap 15: Perez gets past Stroll to grab P11 as his recovery drive gets underway. The two Aston Martin's are struggling out there today.\n\nLAP 12/52\n\n\n\nPerez sparkles his way past Stroll to move into P11, up five places from his starting slot#BritishGP #F1 pic.twitter.com/yJkfrTFVyY \u2014 Formula 1 (@F1) July 9, 2023\n\nLap 13: We've now got the classic situation of some teams saying rain is guaranteed whilst others are claiming that it'll miss the track.

            "text": "The two-time world champion, who looks well on course to take his third title this season, is in the form of his career as rivals are left scratching their heads about how to beat him.\n\nRed Bull's domination has meant that opportunities for others to win are slim, and it means that rising youngsters like Norris are having to tread water until they can get hold of more competitive machinery.\n\nAlthough Norris is currently locked into a contract at McLaren until 2026, the team's lacklustre start to the campaign prompted suggestions that the Briton could be tempted to look elsewhere if things did not turn around.\n\nBut Verstappen, who is friends with Norris, thinks that the young Briton should avoid being tempted to think that things could be better elsewhere.\n\nInstead, he cites his own experience at Red Bull, where he stuck at it \u2013 despite times he thought he would have to leave \u2013 and that commitment is now paying off.\n\n\"If Lando was in a race-winning car, he would win races. It's as simple as that,\" explained Verstappen at the British Grand Prix.\n\n\"Sometimes you have to stick to the process, and you believe in the process. People can say: 'Yeah, we believe in it.' But you really have to believe in it.\n\n\"You really have to know and see that you are attracting the right people to make a winning team. And you really have to get everything into place. And I did trust our process around it.\"\n\nChristian Horner, Team Principal, Red Bull Racing, Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing, Helmut Marko, Consultant, Red Bull Racing Photo by: Mark Sutton / Motorsport Images\n\nVerstappen confesses, however, that amid Red Bull's struggles to find the perfect engine partner, there were times when even he pondered if he would be better set somewhere else on the grid.\n\n\"Of course, sometimes I've been sceptical with a new engine partner, and is this going to work out? But then you can see how much they were determined to make it work.\n\n\"Sometimes I had my doubts, and I guessed, is it actually going to work? I didn't know. Of course, sometimes, I had this sort of[feeling] maybe I should leave. But at the same time in those years, I was also developing a lot as a driver.\n\n\"And you never forget who put you in F1 in the first place. You also have to be loyal to that, I find.\n\n\"People sometimes say the grass is greener on the other side, but most of the time it's not. And I think it's very important to remember these kinds of things in situations like that.\"\n\nSpeaking earlier this year, Norris said that while it was not ideal to wait so long for his maiden win, he was not desperate to move on.\n\n\"At times, it's tough because I'm a competitive guy and I want to win,\" he said. \"Of course, at times you think what could you do in order to get into the position earlier.\n\n\"But also, I'm very comfortable with where I am right now.

Oscar three.\u201d\n\nThe stewards had the option to invoke the driving unnecessarily slowly rule, but instead they referenced the International Sporting Code and the section that reads \u201cany infringement of the principles of fairness in competition, behaviour in an unsportsmanlike manner or attempt to influence the results of a competition, in a way that is contrary to sporting ethics.\u201d\n\nLando Norris, McLaren MCL60, in the pits Photo by: Mark Sutton / Motorsport Images\n\nThey decided to hand Norris a five-second penalty that ultimately proved very expensive as it dropped him from ninth on the road to 13th in the final classification.\n\nMcLaren believes that the use of the words 'unsportsmanlike behaviour' \u2013 a phrase that has rarely been invoked in F1 other than in the context of black and white warning flags during races \u2013 suggests that the FIA wants to set a new reference for situations such as double-stacking.\n\n\u201cIn reality, we went and spoke to the stewards right after the race because we thought these kinds of speeds under a safety car or even a virtual safety car shouldn't be a reasonable infringement,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere's a possibility that the stewards want to set new references. We carry on discussing with them.\n\n\"Ultimately, we trust their judgement but we are reviewing once again right now as we speak the behaviour of Lando because we come out of this race very surprised that this has caused a penalty.\u201d\n\nAsked about precedents for the penalty, Stella said: \u201cIt's one of those where you really need to look into a great level of detail before you express too strong opinions. So let me do the due diligence.\n\n\u201cWe understand the position of the stewards. We understand that they may want to set a precedent so that there's a kind of new way of interpreting the way you have to drive under a safety car.\n\n\"If that's the approach, fine. But it's a bit of a shame that we are involved in this setting of a new precedent.\u201d\n\nStella said there had been no recent indication that the FIA had intended to clamp down on the double stacking issue.\n\n\u201cNot to my knowledge. But like I say, let me do the due diligence, because during the race, you can kind of look into this level of these details, but there's a race still going. We were also fighting for points.\n\n\u201cAnd also still, I think if we could have overtaken rather than being blocked, then we could have opened the five seconds.\n\n\"So we are doing some of the work that we couldn't do during the race in terms of checking exactly the facts associated with this episode.\u201d",

            "text": "The Briton took his best-ever result at his home race, taking an early lead before finishing as runner-up to Red Bull's Max Verstappen.\n\nHe pitted during the safety car caused by Kevin Magnussen's Haas stopping on track and was given the hard Pirelli tyres, with Verstappen and third-place runner Hamilton on the softs.\n\nIt meant Norris had to work harder to fire up his tyres, with the two Britons thrillingly going wheel-to-wheel over the first two laps back to racing speed between Brooklands and Copse.\n\nBut he was able to break DRS to Hamilton and finished second, his first podium since the Emilia Romagna GP last year.\n\nAsked how the race was, Norris said: \"Yeah, pretty insane. I just want to say a big thanks to the whole team. They've done an amazing job.\n\n\"None of this would be possible without the hard work that they've been putting in, so pretty amazing. Pretty insane to put up with the fight.\n\n\"They put me on hard tyres. I don't know why - they're still beginners in some things - but yeah, it was an amazing fight with Lewis to hold him off.\n\n\"I made a few too many mistakes, maybe, but I did what I could. I bought the fight to Max for as long as possible.\n\n\"It's a long, lonely race when you're just in the middle. But it's amazing.\"\n\nLando Norris, McLaren MCL60, Oscar Piastri, McLaren MCL60 Photo by: Andy Hone / Motorsport Images\n\nDiscussing his tyre strategy, Norris said he felt the softs \"made a bit more sense\" but that it was \"all good\" given his second-place finish.\n\nHe also said he felt team-mate Oscar Piastri deserved to finish third after the amazing job he did all weekend.\n\nNorris added: \"Yeah, I think they just wanted to give me a bit more of a test, I guess. That is what Zak said anyway, probably Zak called the shots on that one.\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, I wanted the softs. I feel like it made a bit more sense, especially with the safety car coming out, but I don't care. I am P2 so all good.\n\n\"Pretty amazing. I mean, the whole in lap I was just trying to wave to everyone, so a big thanks to all the British fans out here supporting all of us, also for McLaren.\n\n\"Honestly, we should have had a P2/P3. Oscar did an amazing job all weekend and he should have been P3 today without the safety car.\n\n\"So a shame, he deserved it. But yeah, the fans were amazing. So big thanks to all of them.\"",

And this is inspiration, you know, I would detract from our aerodynamic department if I said, &#8216;Oh, yeah, we saw that. Now we have the solution&#8217;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You see that and you get some, &#8216;Maybe you can do this&#8217;, but then you have to do your own job and your own iteration, otherwise you don&#8217;t get to something that actually works.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As for whether or not McLaren are actually aiming to take the fight to the likes of Aston Martin and Red Bull with their cars somewhat out of position, Stella said the team will make that call based on how the pace plays out against their tyre longevity.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On Sundays, you need to understand what battles to pick,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because, if you pick the wrong battle, in a way, you may use your budget of tyres too aggressively and then you&#8217;ll find yourself in trouble from a strategic point of view, for instance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So it will be important to understand what pace we can sustain in a way that we can also achieve a sensible race strategy and tyre life, for instance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s absolutely something that pretty much all teams and drivers, they need to have a clear idea. Normally, though, you discover that during the race.

And this is inspiration, you know, I would detract from our aerodynamic department if I said, \u2018Oh, yeah, we saw that. Now we have the solution\u2019.\n\n\u201cYou see that and you get some, \u2018Maybe you can do this\u2019, but then you have to do your own job and your own iteration, otherwise you don\u2019t get to something that actually works.\u201d\n\nAs for whether or not McLaren are actually aiming to take the fight to the likes of Aston Martin and Red Bull with their cars somewhat out of position, Stella said the team will make that call based on how the pace plays out against their tyre longevity.\n\n\u201cOn Sundays, you need to understand what battles to pick,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBecause, if you pick the wrong battle, in a way, you may use your budget of tyres too aggressively and then you\u2019ll find yourself in trouble from a strategic point of view, for instance.\n\n\u201cSo it will be important to understand what pace we can sustain in a way that we can also achieve a sensible race strategy and tyre life, for instance.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s absolutely something that pretty much all teams and drivers, they need to have a clear idea. Normally, though, you discover that during the race. For me now, it will be difficult to say what battle we are gonna take because we\u2019ll have to see the pace tomorrow.\u201d\n\nRead Next: F1 Twitter stewards fail in attempt to strip British GP pole away from Max Verstappen",

It was clean for the Dutchman who even had a pitlane incident to break his front wing.</p>\n<p>His final lap wasn&#8217;t great but managed to do enough with an injured hand as he revealed post F1 qualifying. His teammate Sergio Perez did not have a sound run as he failed to make Q3 for the fifth grand prix in a row with the conditions catching him out.</p>\n\n   \n\n<p class=\"td-g-rec td-g-rec-id-content_inlineright td_uid_3_64aade5c00262_rand td_block_template_1 \">\n \n</p>\n\n   \n\n<p>His loss was a gain for the McLaren F1 pair who triumphed over Ferrari, Mercedes and Aston Martin with a surprise double Top 3 finish where Lando Norris was second from Oscar Piastri. They turned it around big time from a mixed bag Friday running.</p>\n<p>They will now have to hang on against Ferrari pair who are right behind them with Charles Leclerc ahead of Carlos Sainz and the Mercedes pair of Lewis Hamilton and George Russell. The former duo had their share of communication and situational gaps.</p>\n<p>Leclerc was supposed to be in front but traffic situation made a tricky scenario as was the case between Verstappen and Hamilton. Mercedes is banking on their better race pace, while Aston Martin seems to be down this F1 weekend as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Verstappen:</strong> &#8220;I think mainly in Q1. I arrived to Turn 15 the first time, I just went straight off. So, it was very weird because Turn 15 and 16, they were a bit damp and it was very difficult to see where exactly: you could only really feel it. So that took a bit of time to really get on top of. I think in general I was just trying to get the laps in. Of course, we knew that we had a quick car, so you don&#8217;t risk it all the way to get through, but still, that final lap. Of course I had my little incident in the pits, where I destroyed my front wing. I had a bit of understeer out of the box. Too much rear grip, so yeah, had to new front wing but that meant of course that I was in the back to start that final run, and that was quite exciting, I think, that out-lap, with passing a few cars here and there, to get the lap in but luckily it was all good enough. But that shows that it can also very quickly fall the other way and you&#8217;re out. Q2 was just building up, track was getting better and better.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So, following the track evolution, and then in Q3, basically the same thing. I think the lap itself was alright, just probably in some places I got caught out a little bit with suddenly, like, an increase in understeer and stuff. But I guess, with the conditions we had, it was anyway going to be quite tricky to have, let&#8217;s say, a perfect lap out there. The run-in with Lewis, it was just on the out lap. I had very cold tyres, because most of the people in front of me had new tyres but I stayed on my used set. So yeah, I just tried to get by. But of course he was trying to warm the tyres. So it took a bit of time to find a bit of space to go through. As for the bandage, it looks a bit interesting, right? But yeah, it&#8217;s just a hand injury. Yeah, that&#8217;s why I said it looks quite interesting, right? But yeah, I injured my finger &#8211; it&#8217;s not making it better &#8211; injured my finger and my hand at the same time but it&#8217;s fine when I&#8217;m driving it&#8217;s OK.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Norris:</strong> &#8220;There are a lot of TV screens around the circuit so I was trying to watch every single one possible and I was surprised how long I was up the top for but it just kind of depended on when Max was going to cross the line so&#8230; I guess I&#8217;m a little bit surprised. I wasn&#8217;t expecting for us to be here or for myself to be here anyway. I think we&#8217;re very happy with the result. But it was more if Max made a mistake rather than if we were quicker than him. He&#8217;s doing a very good job. The team are doing a very good job from his side. I put a good lap in. No mistakes. It was a much cleaner run than my Q3, run 1. But it was a good Quali, you know. I think P1 in Q1. I think P1 in Q2 and almost P1 in Q3 but not quite. But I&#8217;m so happy with that. I don&#8217;t think expectations were low. And I guess in Qualifyings like this, when it&#8217;s wet/dry, it&#8217;s always very difficult to anticipate what&#8217;s going to happen in the whole thing. Some quicker cars were knocked out earlier on, so I think that opened up some opportunities for us to be sitting here. But my Friday just wasn&#8217;t that great. FP3 was obviously a bit tricky with the conditions, so I didn&#8217;t have the most confidence all weekend but I managed to pull it out when it matters so I&#8217;m happy with it.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Piastri:</strong> &#8220;It&#8217;s a very special moment, to be in the top three. It&#8217;s been a couple of years since I&#8217;ve been to one of these press conferences, so it&#8217;s nice to be back. But no, it&#8217;s been a great day. Even this weekend, I think, you know, we thought we could get into the top 10 at least, but yeah, when the conditions were looking like they were, it&#8217;s generally been pretty solid for us previously. So you know, I think we went in quietly confident that we could pull off something pretty special. And we&#8217;ve managed to do it. So yeah, very nice to be back. And yeah, happy with the lap I did. There wasn&#8217;t too much left out there. So I&#8217;m happy to be in the top three. For the race, I mean, firstly, stay in the points, that would be good. I think we&#8217;ll have to see what our race pace is like, you know. Lando showed last week that we can hang on in the races now to a much better extent. So hopefully we can try and do the same tomorrow. Of course, staying in the top three will be tricky with quite a few quick cars behind us. But definitely a solid points score can be on the cards.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Perez:</strong> &#8220;It was a terrible session. Towards the end of Q1, I think the red flag lasted longer than we thought, and we stayed there waiting quite a long time, and I just couldn&#8217;t put enough temperature into the tyre. It&#8217;s very frustrating because we had a good Friday, the pace in the car was there, and we paid the price. I think in these tricky conditions is where I struggle the most with the car so it&#8217;s something for us to understand as well.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Leclerc:</strong> &#8220;A pretty good qualifying, considering that I struggled a bit in the last few races in mixed conditions on slick tyres. I felt good today, because it seems that the hard work I&#8217;ve put in to improve this has paid off. I didn&#8217;t put the perfect lap together in Q3 as I lost grip in turn 15, so a front row position was not possible today. It&#8217;s nice to see McLaren be so quick and I expect an exciting race tomorrow with all of us so close together. We don&#8217;t have any race trim data on my side because I missed out on FP2, but we maximised every session since then and are in a decent starting position, so everything is possible tomorrow. In the pitlane, it&#8217;s something that we were expecting as we are always trying to get out the cars at the same time as it&#8217;s better to manage the cars coming. But then on track obviously this is where we had a bit more of a discussion.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have one race where I have the priority to choose whether I want to be in front or behind, and one race Carlos has the priority to choose whether he wants to be in front or behind. I had the choice here and I decided to be in front, then at the end we were very tight on timing and I think it was very difficult for us to know whether we were going to get past or not before the flag and Carlos decided to overtake. It is not ideal, we will discuss about it, it had no influence, so no big deal. Obviously with the adrenaline inside the car and you don&#8217;t know at that point if you&#8217;re going to make it, the radio message was probably a bit more aggressive than it should have been.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Hamilton:</strong> &#8220;We weren&#8217;t quite quick enough today unfortunately. The conditions were tricky out there but there was still an element of fun to it, as we tried to get on top of the tyres. There were some moments where it looked like we had the potential to challenge further forward, but then we fell back a little. We seem to struggle on the single lap more than we do on the race pace, so we will see what we can do tomorrow. If we can progress forward, then that would be amazing. Hopefully we can put some pressure on the cars ahead and get into a battle with them.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Alonso:</strong> &#8220;It&#8217;s not the Qualifying we wanted in what was a challenging session in drying conditions. There is still a long race ahead of us tomorrow and our Sunday pace is normally a strong point of this car. We still achieved another Q3 result, but we need to keep understanding our car at different circuits. The weather tomorrow may also be changeable, as it was today, so we need to remain focused and see what we can do in race conditions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Top 10 also had Williams&#8217; Alexander Albon and Alpine&#8217;s Pierre Gasly where both their teammates couldn&#8217;t make it in Q3. The former looked pretty solid until his lap deletion in Q1 where he almost was knocked out and eventually progressed into Q3.</p>\n<p>After showing supreme pace, Albon only managed eighth while lack of experience kept Logan Sargeant out of Q3. On Alpine&#8217;s side, Gasly made it in but teammate Esteban Ocon rued his run-in with Leclerc and Lance Stroll for a disruptive Q2 run.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t the best of days for Alfa Romeo, Haas and AlphaTauri, where Valtteri Bottas did not have enough fuel to be disqualified eventually. His teammate Zhou Guanyu couldn&#8217;t make it out of Q1 as did both the AlphaTauri F1 pair.</p>\n<p>Yuki Tsunoda was close but Nyck de Vries was far out, with Haas&#8217; Kevin Magnussen having another set of hard luck with a mechanical issue. His teammate Nico Hulkenberg rued the lack of DRS in Q2 for the required extra push to make it in Q3.</p>\n<p><strong>Albon:</strong> &#8220;It&#8217;s been an amazing weekend but it&#8217;s funny when you finish in Q3, with P8 and you&#8217;re disappointed. We have to be realistic but it&#8217;s been great so far. In Qualifying, the session was going quite smoothly but, as the track dried out, corner speeds picked up and track evolution came in. We started to get quite a bit of degradation through the lap, even front deg, so we need to go away and understand that but, by the time I got to Q3, I was struggling a little bit with those combined factors. We&#8217;ve been really on top of it since the start of the weekend and I got into rhythm very quickly and adapted well to the changes, so we really hit the ground running. I think we ended up where we expected to be but I think if you told us we&#8217;d be here at the beginning of the weekend, we wouldn&#8217;t believe you.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Ocon:</strong> &#8220;It&#8217;s been a frustrating day and a missed opportunity for us in Qualifying. It&#8217;s always disappointing not to make Q3, especially as we had the pace to do so. The conditions were not easy but we had been managing it very well. In Q2, it was not an ideal start to my final push lap as I braked on the wet side of the track alongside Lance and then spent my lap behind Charles, which cost us time. There are plenty of things for us to review from today, however, I&#8217;m feeling ready to make up some ground in tomorrow&#8217;s race.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Magnussen:</strong> &#8220;It just doesn&#8217;t seem to be my year this one so far, but this is where you show experience, stay cool and keep fighting. Everything switched off in the car, I had no power steering, nothing, I don&#8217;t know what it was in Q1. Until that point it felt good compared to the rest of the weekend, I was on a decent lap to improve there &#8211; on the one I stopped. There was still time on the clock so I don&#8217;t know if that would have been the last one.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Bottas:</strong> &#8220;Today&#8217;s results are very disappointing, as it seemed we actually had a real chance to make it into the top ten. I started to lose power on the final inlap, and then the engine stopped. We eventually figured out it was a technical issue with fuel in the car, and we are already working to address that and make sure it doesn&#8217;t happen again. Sadly, this means we&#8217;ll be starting at the back of the grid in the race, which is not where we would have deserved to be looking at our pace. Still, tomorrow will be a long day and, as always, the weather could add one more element of unpredictability: the car felt better than yesterday, and we have slightly better pace compared to previous events, so our aim will be to make the most out of it and fight as hard as we can through the field.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Tsunoda:</strong> &#8220;I ended up very close to Q2 again, it&#8217;s frustrating and a shame, but I&#8217;m happy with my performance. Track evolution was high and almost fully dry in the end, but the team did a good job with the strategy. We tried many different things with the new upgrade, and compared to yesterday, the car felt better. I feel more support in the places I need, especially in the low-speed corners, and more rotation in the high-speed corners, which we were aiming for. There is room for improvement, but we&#8217;re still trying to understand the car&#8217;s behaviour more. I reset myself and do whatever I can tomorrow to extract as much performance from the car and finish as high as possible.&#8221;</p>\n \n<p><a href=\"https://formularapida.net/british-gp-verstappen-takes-pole-from-mclaren-pair/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here&#8217;s</a> how F1 British GP qualifying panned out</p>\n\n   \n\n<p class=\"td-g-rec td-g-rec-id-content_bottom td_uid_5_64aade5c00332_rand td_block_template_1 \">\n \n</p>\n\n   \n\n    </div>",
            "text": "The Saturday in F1 British GP was made tricky due to weather conditions as the field was bunched up together closely despite Max Verstappen\u2019s run.\n\nThe weather really made for a tricky Saturday in F1 British GP at Silverstone as it closed up qualifying even though Red Bull\u2019s Verstappen had the last laugh. It was clean for the Dutchman who even had a pitlane incident to break his front wing.\n\nHis final lap wasn\u2019t great but managed to do enough with an injured hand as he revealed post F1 qualifying. His teammate Sergio Perez did not have a sound run as he failed to make Q3 for the fifth grand prix in a row with the conditions catching him out.\n\nHis loss was a gain for the McLaren F1 pair who triumphed over Ferrari, Mercedes and Aston Martin with a surprise double Top 3 finish where Lando Norris was second from Oscar Piastri. They turned it around big time from a mixed bag Friday running.\n\nThey will now have to hang on against Ferrari pair who are right behind them with Charles Leclerc ahead of Carlos Sainz and the Mercedes pair of Lewis Hamilton and George Russell. The former duo had their share of communication and situational gaps.\n\nLeclerc was supposed to be in front but traffic situation made a tricky scenario as was the case between Verstappen and Hamilton. Mercedes is banking on their better race pace, while Aston Martin seems to be down this F1 weekend as well.\n\nVerstappen: \u201cI think mainly in Q1. I arrived to Turn 15 the first time, I just went straight off. So, it was very weird because Turn 15 and 16, they were a bit damp and it was very difficult to see where exactly: you could only really feel it. So that took a bit of time to really get on top of. I think in general I was just trying to get the laps in. Of course, we knew that we had a quick car, so you don\u2019t risk it all the way to get through, but still, that final lap. Of course I had my little incident in the pits, where I destroyed my front wing. I had a bit of understeer out of the box. Too much rear grip, so yeah, had to new front wing but that meant of course that I was in the back to start that final run, and that was quite exciting, I think, that out-lap, with passing a few cars here and there, to get the lap in but luckily it was all good enough. But that shows that it can also very quickly fall the other way and you\u2019re out. Q2 was just building up, track was getting better and better.\n\n\u201cSo, following the track evolution, and then in Q3, basically the same thing. I think the lap itself was alright, just probably in some places I got caught out a little bit with suddenly, like, an increase in understeer and stuff. But I guess, with the conditions we had, it was anyway going to be quite tricky to have, let\u2019s say, a perfect lap out there. The run-in with Lewis, it was just on the out lap. I had very cold tyres, because most of the people in front of me had new tyres but I stayed on my used set. So yeah, I just tried to get by. But of course he was trying to warm the tyres. So it took a bit of time to find a bit of space to go through. As for the bandage, it looks a bit interesting, right? But yeah, it\u2019s just a hand injury. Yeah, that\u2019s why I said it looks quite interesting, right? But yeah, I injured my finger \u2013 it\u2019s not making it better \u2013 injured my finger and my hand at the same time but it\u2019s fine when I\u2019m driving it\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nNorris: \u201cThere are a lot of TV screens around the circuit so I was trying to watch every single one possible and I was surprised how long I was up the top for but it just kind of depended on when Max was going to cross the line so\u2026 I guess I\u2019m a little bit surprised. I wasn\u2019t expecting for us to be here or for myself to be here anyway. I think we\u2019re very happy with the result. But it was more if Max made a mistake rather than if we were quicker than him. He\u2019s doing a very good job. The team are doing a very good job from his side. I put a good lap in. No mistakes. It was a much cleaner run than my Q3, run 1. But it was a good Quali, you know. I think P1 in Q1. I think P1 in Q2 and almost P1 in Q3 but not quite. But I\u2019m so happy with that.

            "article_html": "<div><p>McLaren was one of the fewest mid-field teams to endure a horrendous start to the 2023 <a href=\"https://www.sportsmanor.com/tag/formula-1/\">Formula 1</a> season, with hardly any positives to show on the track. But, fast-forward to June 2023, former McLaren world champion, Mika Hakkinen envisioned a contrasting change of fortunes for the Woking-based outfit over the rest of the season.&#160;</p>\n<p>Of course, considering their poor run of form, it seemed far too impractical for McLaren to challenge the leading mid-fielders, let alone the championship leader, Red Bull. Furthermore, several Papaya fans themselves laughed Hakkinen&#8217;s claim off, negating the chances of seeing their favorite team anywhere near the top 3.&#160;</p>\n \n<p><br>\nBut, the British Grand Prix has certainly proven the entire motorsport fandom wrong, as McLaren quite literally orchestrated Hakkinen&#8217;s comments from a month back. Lando Norris was on provisional pole until the very last second of the qualifying session only for Max Verstappen to reclaim his desired spot.&#160;</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, <a href=\"https://www.sportsmanor.com/tag/lando-norris/\">Norris</a> will be starting the race on the front row while his rookie teammate, <a href=\"https://www.sportsmanor.com/tag/oscar-piastri/\">Oscar Piastri</a>, finds himself lined up behind Verstappen, in P3.&#160;</p>\n<h2>Mika Hakkinen&#8217;s neglected McLaren F1 prediction comes alive&#160;</h2>\n<p>A month back, Hakkinen made a wild <a href=\"https://www.sportsmanor.com/tag/mclaren/\">McLaren</a> prediction for the rest of the season, suggesting the former champions could well find themselves back in the hunt. What&#8217;s more, the Finn warned the high-flying Red Bull Racing to watch out for a massive twist from McLaren.</p>\n<p>Speaking to Unibet, the Finn said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think anyone is able to catch up [to Red Bull] this year. The only surprise I think we&#8217;ll see is McLaren&#8217;s possible progress during the next two months. I think they will surprise us massively. Just in terms of the speed of the car, they will probably challenge Red Bull.&#8221;</p>\n<p></p><p class=\"rll-youtube-player\"></p><br>\nMcLaren was one of the fewest teams to bring updates into the Austrian Grand Prix last weekend and almost immediately showed drastic improvements. Both the drivers seemed confident, and constantly chipped in impressive lap times on board.

            "text": "McLaren was one of the fewest mid-field teams to endure a horrendous start to the 2023 Formula 1 season, with hardly any positives to show on the track. But, fast-forward to June 2023, former McLaren world champion, Mika Hakkinen envisioned a contrasting change of fortunes for the Woking-based outfit over the rest of the season.\n\nOf course, considering their poor run of form, it seemed far too impractical for McLaren to challenge the leading mid-fielders, let alone the championship leader, Red Bull. Furthermore, several Papaya fans themselves laughed Hakkinen\u2019s claim off, negating the chances of seeing their favorite team anywhere near the top 3.\n\n\n\nBut, the British Grand Prix has certainly proven the entire motorsport fandom wrong, as McLaren quite literally orchestrated Hakkinen\u2019s comments from a month back. Lando Norris was on provisional pole until the very last second of the qualifying session only for Max Verstappen to reclaim his desired spot.\n\nNonetheless, Norris will be starting the race on the front row while his rookie teammate, Oscar Piastri, finds himself lined up behind Verstappen, in P3.\n\nMika Hakkinen\u2019s neglected McLaren F1 prediction comes alive\n\nA month back, Hakkinen made a wild McLaren prediction for the rest of the season, suggesting the former champions could well find themselves back in the hunt. What\u2019s more, the Finn warned the high-flying Red Bull Racing to watch out for a massive twist from McLaren.\n\nSpeaking to Unibet, the Finn said, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is able to catch up [to Red Bull] this year. The only surprise I think we\u2019ll see is McLaren\u2019s possible progress during the next two months. I think they will surprise us massively. Just in terms of the speed of the car, they will probably challenge Red Bull.\u201d\n\nMcLaren was one of the fewest teams to bring updates into the Austrian Grand Prix last weekend and almost immediately showed drastic improvements. Both the drivers seemed confident, and constantly chipped in impressive lap times on board. While the times weren\u2019t good enough to defeat the mighty Verstappen, it certainly was solid enough to bring down the likes of Mercedes, Aston Martin, and Ferrari.\n\nHence, considering the positive trend, a McLaren show was always on the cards at Silverstone. But, nobody foresaw a McLaren 2-3 in the qualifying. Now, with an exciting afternoon to look forward to in the United Kingdom, can the Papaya outfit take on the supremely dominant Red Bull and secure its first race victory since Daniel Ricciardo in Monza 2021?",

The drivers restarted with three minutes of Q1 remaining, meaning an effective hot-lap shootout as the track dried and Perez found himself edged down into 16th.\n\nMORE: Everything you need to know about the Austrian Grand Prix\n\nBritish Grand Prix F1 qualifying results\n\nPosition Driver Team Time 1 Max Verstappen Red Bull 1 minute 26.720 seconds 2 Lando Norris McLaren +0.241 3 Oscar Piastri McLaren +0.372 4 Charles Leclerc Ferrari +0.416 5 Carlos Sainz Ferrari +0.428 6 George Russell Mercedes +0.435 7 Lewis Hamilton Mercedes +0.491 8 Alex Albon Williams +0.810 9 Fernando Alonso Aston Martin +0.939 10 Pierre Gasly Alpine +0.969 11 Nico Hulkenberg Haas \u2014 12 Lance Stroll Aston Martin \u2014 13 Esteban Ocon Alpine \u2014 14 Lorgan Sargeant Williams \u2014 15 Valtteri Bottas Alfa Romeo \u2014 16 Sergio Perez Red Bull \u2014 17 Yuki Tsunoda AlphaTaur \u2014 18 Zhou Guanyu Alfa Romeo \u2014 19 Nyck de Vries AlphaTauri \u2014 20 Kevin Magnussen Haas \u2014\n\nBritish Grand Prix F1 qualifying as it happened\n\nEND OF Q3: Lando Norris on to provisional pole and the grandstand goes wild!!!! Hold you applause, though, Verstappen comes through for his fifth consecutive start in P1. McLaren are second and third with Piastri tucking in behind Norris to end a phenomenal session for them. Leclerc and Sainz in the Ferraris belatedly got it together to qualify ahead of Russell and Hamilton in the Mercedes.\n\n6 mins to go in Q3: Halfway through the session and Verstappen is fastest from Hamilton, Piastri and the two Ferraris. Remember, Sergio Perez in the other Red Bull bombed out in a frantic Q1.\n\n5 MINS TO GO IN Q3\n\n\n\nTOP 5\n\nVerstappen \ud83d\udcf8\n\nHamilton\n\nPiastri\n\nLeclerc\n\nSainz#BritishGP #F1 pic.twitter.com/5magkYBoDQ \u2014 Formula 1 (@F1) July 8, 2023\n\n12 mins to go in Q3: Here we go then, the 10-driver shootout. The sun is out. Will it stay that way for the next 12 minutes?\n\nDRIVERS ELIMINATED IN Q2: Nico Hulkenberg (Haas), Lance Stroll (Aston Martin), Esteban Ocon (Alpine), Logan Sargeant (Williams), Valtteri Bottas (Alfa Romeo)\n\nEND OF Q2: Verstappen goes quickest by just over three-tenths of a second. Piastri up into second, ahead of McLaren team-mate Norris. Albon clocked in fourth in the Williams, but his team-mate Sargeant is one of the drivers who failed to make the cut. The McLaren's of Hamilton and Russell squeaked through in eighth and 10th.\n\nQ2 CLASSIFICATION \ud83d\udc40\n\n\n\nMax Verstappen tops the session, with the McLaren duo just behind! \ud83d\udc4a#BritishGP #F1 pic.twitter.com/E0pAFjlzkE \u2014 Formula 1 (@F1) July 8, 2023\n\n3 mins to go in Q2: Norris flying in the McLaren. He goes fastest, ahead of Hamilton by half a second. British 1-2 as it stands.\n\n5 mins to go in Q2: Verstappen goes quickest, half a second ahead of Alonso, only to get pipped by Piastri. The track is getting faster by the second and we're in for a dramatic finish to Q2.\n\n10 mins to go in Q2: Norris is fastest again from Gasly, Verstappen. Piastri and Sainz.\n\n15 mins to go in Q2: We're back underway. The sun is out but apparently there's more rain on the way. Let's see where the cards fall.\n\nDRIVERS ELIMINATED IN Q1: Sergio Perez (Red Bull), Yuki Tsunoda (AlphaTauri), Zhou Guanyu (Alfa Romeo), Nyck de Vries (AlphaTauri), Kevin Magnussen (Haas)\n\nEnd of Q1: Sergio Perez is out in Q1! It's been a bit of a dismal run for the Red Bull driver, who was very briefly top of the time sheets as he registered the first hot lap after the enforced stoppage for Magnussen's crash. However, driver by driver, people went quicker than him and he finished down in 16th.\n\nMagnussen will take P20 having inadvertently caused all the carnage. Zhou Guanyu in 18th in the Alfa Romeo with Alpha Tauri duo Yuki Tsunoda and Nyck de Vries either side of him.\n\nAfter all that, Lando Norris remained quickest in the McLaren and three of the top four places went to British drivers, with Russell and Hamilton in third and fourth behind Leclerc. Verstappen was fifth fastest.\n\n0 mins to go in Q1: Chaos here as the track dries out. Lando Norris goes quickest ahead of Albon. Basically, anyone who doesn't complete a hot lap here is in huge bother.\n\n2 mins to go in Q1: We're moving. Can everyone who needs to get around for an out lap and a hot lap? It's going to be tight.\n\n3 mins to go in Q1: We will be back underway in two minutes. To make all the clumsy drivers out there feel better, the best in the world, Max Verstappen, has just driven into the pit wall at very low speed and pranged his front wing.\n\n3 mins to go in Q1: Right, Magnussen's Haas is on a truck and being driven away. We're almost good to go.\n\n3 mins to go in Q1: Marshalls are working on shifting Magnussen's car. Until that's gone, we won't b doing a great deal. Magnussen is standing trackside waving to fans, so that's nice.\n\n3 mins to go in Q1: Rain coming down now and Perez is into the pits. He's languishing dicily in 14th. It's a bit of a lottery now. Kevin Magnussen has stopped and we have a red flag with 3 minutes and 11 seconds remaining.\n\n5 mins to go in Q1: Williams have been the story of the practice sessions so far but their cars do not like the rain. Right now Alex Albon and Josh Sargeant are down in the bottom five.\n\n7 mins to go in Q1: Perez has hauled his Red Bull to 12th and is not happy with his tyre choice. It's a different story for Verstappen, who goes fastest ahead of Alonso and Russell.\n\n10 mins to go in Q1: Hamilton and his grubby tyres are out of the bottom five. Sergio Perez in the Red Bull finds himself in unexpected peril down there. George Russell goes fastest. It looks nice and dry right now.\n\n12 mins to go in Q1: Logan Sargeant has told the Williams crew that it's raining. So that's fun. Verstappen's lap has been deleted for exceeding the track limits. Fernando Alonso is faster ahead of the world champion and Lance Stroll.\n\n15 mins to go in Q1: Lewis Hamilton spins heading into Stove. That's the risk on slicks around this track right now. Hamilton managed to keep his wheels rolling and got back on his way back out of the gravel. However, that's going to compromise his next bid for a hot lap. Verstappen is quickest head of Hamilton's teammate Russell.\n\nLewis Hamilton finds himself in a spin and in the gravel at the start of Q1 \ud83c\udf00\n\n\n\nHe's now back on track#BritishGP #F1 pic.twitter.com/Zzmhc614gr \u2014 Formula 1 (@F1) July 8, 2023\n\n18 mins to go in Q1: It's not raining right now. Tyre selection is going to be crucial here. Can the drivers get away with a slick lap. They're queued up at the end of the pit lane and off we go.\n\n20 mins to start: Of course, a soggy qualifying session at Silverstone is nothing new. This is British summertime, after all. Last year, Carlos Sainz braved the rain to snatch pole from Verstappen. How Ferrari would love a repeat. They and everyone else in the field need some crumbs of encouragement in a season where Red Bull have won every single race and claimed eight out of nine poles.\n\n40 mins to start: The forecast is for the rain to have stopped by the time qualifying starts at 15:00 BST, but the weather was filthy in FP3 this morning. Charles Leclerc was forced to sit out the afternoon session yesterday after Ferrari discovered an electrical problem with his car. It looked like the enforced break did him some good as he topped the FP3 time sheets ahead of Alex Albon and Fernando Alonso. Williams driver Albon has been in the top three in every session so far. Can he make it count in qualifying?\n\n1 hour to start: Hello and welcome to The Sporting News' live coverage of qualifying for the British Grand Prix at a wet and grey Silverstone.\n\nBritish Grand Prix F1 Practice result\n\nIt was a familiar story as Max Verstappen topped the time sheets in first and second practice at Silverstone on Friday.\n\nThe world champion only edged ahead of Ferrari's Carlos Sainz by 0.022 seconds, with Williams' Alex Albon in third. It was a strong showing from Williams at their home Grand Prix, with Logan Sargeant fifth behind Verstappen's Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez.\n\nCharles Leclerc did not get on the track in the afternoon after Ferrari discovered an electrical problem with his car.\n\nMercedes and their British duo George Russell and Lewis Hamilton headed into the race weekend with a new front wing but languished down in 12th and 15th.\n\nWhat time does the British Grand Prix F1 start?\n\nDate: Sunday, July 9\n\nSunday, July 9 Start time: 3:00 p.m (Local) | 3:00 p.m (BST) | 10:00 a.m (ET) | 1:00 a.m (AEST, July 9)\n\nSunday's 2023 British is scheduled to start at 3:00 p.m. local time. Lights out will take place just after 10:00 a.m. ET.\n\nWhat TV channel is the F1 on?\n\nUK USA Canada Australia TV Channel Sky Sports F1 ESPN/ABC TSN (English); RDS (French) Fox Sports\n\nWhere can I live stream F1?\n\nUK USA Canada Australia Live Stream NOW TV / Sky Go app ESPN+ Fubo, TSN Direct Kayo\n\nF1 season schedule 2023\n\nIn 2023, the Formula One Calendar will be made up on 23 races across four different continents.\n\nThe action began with the Bahrain Grand Prix on March 5 and will end on November 26 in Abu Dhabi.\n\nHere's the latest schedule (subject to change):",

            "article_html": "<div><h3>From complete domination to intense battles between past and present teammates, let&#8217;s look at McLaren&#8217;s top 5 seasons in F1 history.</h3>\n<p class=\"code-block code-block-56\">\n\n</p>\n<p>The British motor racing team, McLaren, is the second-oldest active team and the second most successful <a href=\"https://lastwordonsports.com/motorsports/2023/03/25/formula-1s-biggest-what-ifs-part-2-williams-special/\">Formula One</a> team after Ferrari. As part of their iconic history, McLaren has a total of 183 race wins, 12 Drivers&#8217; Championships and 8 Constructors&#8217; Championships to their name.</p>\n<p>When it comes to great moments and great seasons for the team, there is no shortage to pick from. Listed below, are a few of their best ever seasons in F1. Where not only the car was a pure representation of sheer speed. The driver lineups were the perfect liaison for the team as a whole. These are the McLaren&#8217;s top 5 seasons in Formula 1.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>5. 1998 &#8211; Mika H&#228;kkinen triumphs over Michael Schumacher</h3>\n<p align=\"center\" id=\"lwos_incontent_1\">\n \n</p><p>At the opening race, the McLaren&#8217;s of Mika H&#228;kkinen and David Coulthard lapped the entire field in Australia, starting out their season strong, declaring how dominant their package already was. However, throughout the season Schumacher looked quite strong in his Ferrari, as he put constant pressure on H&#228;kkinen. This season was the start of the classic Schumacher vs H&#228;kkinen rivalry that ran for 3-years.</p>\n<p class=\"code-block code-block-55\">\n\n\n\n</p>\n<p>Despite fighting against the then 2-time World Champion Schumacher, H&#228;kkinen together with his McLaren MP4/13 was resilient and showed he had what it took to claim his first World Drivers Championship. His performance at the N&#252;rburgring was a clear testament to the fact that he could handle the title pressure.</p>\n<p>The pressure was well handled by the Flying Finn. He earned his first ever Formula One title by 14 points ahead of Ferrari&#8217;s Schumacher. And in a season where H&#228;kkinen was the stronger out of the McLaren duo, the role of teamwork came to play in order to secure both titles. David Coulthard played a huge role in ensuring McLaren the Constructors&#8217; Championship, with a win at the San Marino Grand Prix and 8 podium finishes in a season where he finished in the top 7 of every race he did not retire from.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>4. 1989 &#8211; Controversy wins</h3>\n<p align=\"center\" id=\"lwos_incontent_2\">\n \n</p><p>1989 was a year dominated by the McLaren&#8217;s of Alain Prost and <a href=\"https://lastwordonsports.com/motorsports/2017/05/01/ayrton-senna-life-hero/\">Ayrton Senna</a>. In a season where the team managed to win 10 out of the 16 races, have 9 retirements shared between the drivers, and even a disqualification from a race, McLaren were still able to comfortably win both the Drivers&#8217; Championship and the Constructor&#8217;s Championship.</p>\n<p>The Japanese Grand Prix held that year is considered one of the most controversial races in F1 history. There was a tough rivalry brewing between Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna for two years as teammates at McLaren, and the tension seemed to have reached the tipping point. A low-speed collision on lap 47 at the final chicane between the Frenchman and the Brazilian put them both off the track. Prost ditched his stalled car, whilst Senna restarted his, went into the pits to change his front wing, and overtook Benetton&#8217;s Alessandro Nannini to take the win. In the aftermath of the race, Senna was controversially disqualified for getting a push start from the marshals to rejoin the circuit. Ultimately, the Japanese Grand Prix decided the 1989 Drivers&#8217; Championship in Prost&#8217;s favour.</p>\n<p>McLaren remained the team to beat with Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost continuing their dark but ever-so-successful partnership. Prost won the title by 16 points, and McLaren won the Constructors&#8217; by a big margin of 64 points.</p>\n<p><a id=\"9jgxBKvVQ1J6EGG4YreYoQ\" class=\"gie-single\" href=\"http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/74342705\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Embed from Getty Images</a></p>\n<p align=\"center\" id=\"lwos_incontent_3\">\n \n</p>\n<p class=\"code-block code-block-51\">\n\n</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>3. 2007 &#8211; Rookie vs reigning world champion vs spygate</h3>\n<p>McLaren might have lost out on both titles in 2007, but there is no denying the excellence that resided in that team at the time. The team had signed two new drivers, the reigning 2-time world champion <a href=\"https://lastwordonsports.com/motorsports/2018/10/30/a-statistical-look-into-fernando-alonsos-top-5-drivers-of-all-time/\">Fernando Alonso</a>, and young rookie, Lewis Hamilton. McLaren also had a good car, so there was no denying the potential for greatness within the team.</p>\n<p>McLaren had quite the competition from Ferrari. The two teams were so competitive, that there was a 4-way battle for the Drivers&#8217; title between the McLaren duo and Ferrari drivers, Kimi R&#228;ikk&#246;nen and Felipe Massa, till the end of the season.</p>\n<p>F1 rookie Lewis Hamilton was able to pick up the most wins of the season (4), and McLaren and Ferrari had 6 wins each to their names. The Driver&#8217;s Championship was won by R&#228;ikk&#246;nen with 110 points, and Lewis Hamilton finished his debut season as runner-up with 109 points, with Fernando Alonso taking third on the same number of points as his teammate. Felipe Massa scored a total of 54 points by the end of the season.</p>\n<p align=\"center\" id=\"lwos_incontent_4\">\n \n</p><p class=\"code-block code-block-52\">\n\n</p>\n<p>Ferrari might have had the faster car that season, but McLaren&#8217;s line-up proved to be the stronger package. McLaren would have actually won the Constructors&#8217; Championship had they not been disqualified from the Constructors&#8217; Championship over the &#8220;spygate&#8221; controversy. The controversy involved the McLaren, Ferrari and Renault F1 teams, with accusations that confidential technical information on Ferrari had been passed between McLaren and Renault.</p>\n<p>Had &#8220;spygate&#8221; not occurred, the Woking-based team would have walked away with at least one title by the end of the 2007 season, but there is no denying that they had a better complete package compared to their Italian rivals. For a team that didn&#8217;t have the faster car, they sure put up a big fight.</p>\n<p class=\"code-block code-block-53\">\n\n</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>2. 1984 &#8211; Half a point!</h3>\n<p>The 1984 Formula One season gave us a record-breaking end to the season. The Drivers&#8217; Championship result is the closest finish in all of Formula One history, with Niki Lauda finishing HALF a point above his McLaren teammate Alain Prost.</p>\n<p>McLaren won the Constructors&#8217; Championship by 86 points ahead of Ferrari, having won 12 of the 16 races held that season.</p>\n<p>McLaren were in a league of their own, so much so that the entire season was just a duel between their two drivers. Prost won 7 races, with Lauda winning 5, although it was the Austrian that won the title.</p>\n<p align=\"center\" id=\"lwos_incontent_5\">\n \n</p><p>What made this season even more spectacular is that McLaren were not actually expected to be in the fight for titles. The fight was expected to be between Brabham, Renault and Ferrari as it had been in the previous season, but it was McLaren that came with the perfect setup for the 1984 season. The TAG turbo engine combined with the incredibly designed MP4/2 was a force to be reckoned with.</p>\n<p>Reigning Drivers&#8217; Champion Nelson Piquet drove the Brabham-BMW and was typically the fastest on track. He was able to take 9 pole positions. However, reliability issues saw the Brazilian failing to score a point in the first six rounds due to numerous engine and turbo failures, which meant he was never able to challenge consistently. It was a season filled with retirements for many, not just Piquet, but the strong pairing of Prost and Lauda together with the Mp4/2 proved to be the most consistent with desirable results, earning them both titles that year.</p>\n<p>The overall package came through for McLaren during that retirement-plagued season, and that is why the season is ranked top 2 in this list.</p>\n<p><a id=\"z0FD6B_oQRtgCx0ZkCmMNw\" class=\"gie-single\" href=\"http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/926577594\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Embed from Getty Images</a></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>1. 1988 &#8211; Dominance is the name</h3>\n<p>If there is a year McLaren would want to experience again, it&#8217;s the 1988 season. They were dominant.</p>\n<p>For McLaren, their 1988 season was one of their most dominant if not the most. The Woking-based team won a stonking 15 out of 16 races that season, allowing them to win the Constructors&#8217; by a jaw-dropping margin of 134 points ahead of Ferrari. They scored 199 points; that&#8217;s more than 3 times the amount of points that Ferrari scored!

            "text": "From complete domination to intense battles between past and present teammates, let\u2019s look at McLaren\u2019s top 5 seasons in F1 history.\n\nThe British motor racing team, McLaren, is the second-oldest active team and the second most successful Formula One team after Ferrari. As part of their iconic history, McLaren has a total of 183 race wins, 12 Drivers\u2019 Championships and 8 Constructors\u2019 Championships to their name.\n\nWhen it comes to great moments and great seasons for the team, there is no shortage to pick from. Listed below, are a few of their best ever seasons in F1. Where not only the car was a pure representation of sheer speed. The driver lineups were the perfect liaison for the team as a whole. These are the McLaren\u2019s top 5 seasons in Formula 1.\n\n5. 1998 \u2013 Mika H\u00e4kkinen triumphs over Michael Schumacher\n\nAt the opening race, the McLaren\u2019s of Mika H\u00e4kkinen and David Coulthard lapped the entire field in Australia, starting out their season strong, declaring how dominant their package already was. However, throughout the season Schumacher looked quite strong in his Ferrari, as he put constant pressure on H\u00e4kkinen. This season was the start of the classic Schumacher vs H\u00e4kkinen rivalry that ran for 3-years.\n\nDespite fighting against the then 2-time World Champion Schumacher, H\u00e4kkinen together with his McLaren MP4/13 was resilient and showed he had what it took to claim his first World Drivers Championship. His performance at the N\u00fcrburgring was a clear testament to the fact that he could handle the title pressure.\n\nThe pressure was well handled by the Flying Finn. He earned his first ever Formula One title by 14 points ahead of Ferrari\u2019s Schumacher. And in a season where H\u00e4kkinen was the stronger out of the McLaren duo, the role of teamwork came to play in order to secure both titles. David Coulthard played a huge role in ensuring McLaren the Constructors\u2019 Championship, with a win at the San Marino Grand Prix and 8 podium finishes in a season where he finished in the top 7 of every race he did not retire from.\n\n4. 1989 \u2013 Controversy wins\n\n1989 was a year dominated by the McLaren\u2019s of Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna. In a season where the team managed to win 10 out of the 16 races, have 9 retirements shared between the drivers, and even a disqualification from a race, McLaren were still able to comfortably win both the Drivers\u2019 Championship and the Constructor\u2019s Championship.\n\nThe Japanese Grand Prix held that year is considered one of the most controversial races in F1 history. There was a tough rivalry brewing between Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna for two years as teammates at McLaren, and the tension seemed to have reached the tipping point. A low-speed collision on lap 47 at the final chicane between the Frenchman and the Brazilian put them both off the track. Prost ditched his stalled car, whilst Senna restarted his, went into the pits to change his front wing, and overtook Benetton\u2019s Alessandro Nannini to take the win. In the aftermath of the race, Senna was controversially disqualified for getting a push start from the marshals to rejoin the circuit. Ultimately, the Japanese Grand Prix decided the 1989 Drivers\u2019 Championship in Prost\u2019s favour.\n\nMcLaren remained the team to beat with Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost continuing their dark but ever-so-successful partnership. Prost won the title by 16 points, and McLaren won the Constructors\u2019 by a big margin of 64 points.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\n3. 2007 \u2013 Rookie vs reigning world champion vs spygate\n\nMcLaren might have lost out on both titles in 2007, but there is no denying the excellence that resided in that team at the time. The team had signed two new drivers, the reigning 2-time world champion Fernando Alonso, and young rookie, Lewis Hamilton. McLaren also had a good car, so there was no denying the potential for greatness within the team.\n\nMcLaren had quite the competition from Ferrari. The two teams were so competitive, that there was a 4-way battle for the Drivers\u2019 title between the McLaren duo and Ferrari drivers, Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and Felipe Massa, till the end of the season.\n\nF1 rookie Lewis Hamilton was able to pick up the most wins of the season (4), and McLaren and Ferrari had 6 wins each to their names. The Driver\u2019s Championship was won by R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen with 110 points, and Lewis Hamilton finished his debut season as runner-up with 109 points, with Fernando Alonso taking third on the same number of points as his teammate. Felipe Massa scored a total of 54 points by the end of the season.\n\nFerrari might have had the faster car that season, but McLaren\u2019s line-up proved to be the stronger package. McLaren would have actually won the Constructors\u2019 Championship had they not been disqualified from the Constructors\u2019 Championship over the \u201cspygate\u201d controversy. The controversy involved the McLaren, Ferrari and Renault F1 teams, with accusations that confidential technical information on Ferrari had been passed between McLaren and Renault.\n\nHad \u201cspygate\u201d not occurred, the Woking-based team would have walked away with at least one title by the end of the 2007 season, but there is no denying that they had a better complete package compared to their Italian rivals. For a team that didn\u2019t have the faster car, they sure put up a big fight.\n\n2. 1984 \u2013 Half a point!\n\nThe 1984 Formula One season gave us a record-breaking end to the season. The Drivers\u2019 Championship result is the closest finish in all of Formula One history, with Niki Lauda finishing HALF a point above his McLaren teammate Alain Prost.\n\nMcLaren won the Constructors\u2019 Championship by 86 points ahead of Ferrari, having won 12 of the 16 races held that season.\n\nMcLaren were in a league of their own, so much so that the entire season was just a duel between their two drivers. Prost won 7 races, with Lauda winning 5, although it was the Austrian that won the title.\n\nWhat made this season even more spectacular is that McLaren were not actually expected to be in the fight for titles. The fight was expected to be between Brabham, Renault and Ferrari as it had been in the previous season, but it was McLaren that came with the perfect setup for the 1984 season. The TAG turbo engine combined with the incredibly designed MP4/2 was a force to be reckoned with.\n\nReigning Drivers\u2019 Champion Nelson Piquet drove the Brabham-BMW and was typically the fastest on track. He was able to take 9 pole positions. However, reliability issues saw the Brazilian failing to score a point in the first six rounds due to numerous engine and turbo failures, which meant he was never able to challenge consistently. It was a season filled with retirements for many, not just Piquet, but the strong pairing of Prost and Lauda together with the Mp4/2 proved to be the most consistent with desirable results, earning them both titles that year.\n\nThe overall package came through for McLaren during that retirement-plagued season, and that is why the season is ranked top 2 in this list.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\n1. 1988 \u2013 Dominance is the name\n\nIf there is a year McLaren would want to experience again, it\u2019s the 1988 season. They were dominant.\n\nFor McLaren, their 1988 season was one of their most dominant if not the most. The Woking-based team won a stonking 15 out of 16 races that season, allowing them to win the Constructors\u2019 by a jaw-dropping margin of 134 points ahead of Ferrari. They scored 199 points; that\u2019s more than 3 times the amount of points that Ferrari scored! McLaren would have won all 16 races hadn\u2019t it been for Jean-Louis Schlesser\u2019s accident with Senna at the Italian Grand Prix. The incident allowed Ferrari to take their first 1-2 at the first Italian Grand Prix since the death of their founder, Enzo Ferrari.\n\nThe drivers\u2019 title was won by Ayrton Senna \u2013 the Brazilian\u2019s first \u2013 after a season-long duel with teammate and then double world champion Alain Prost. Prost scored more points, but since not all results counted, Senna took the title, his best eleven results handing him more points than Prost\u2019s. Senna and Prost were separated by 3 points, with 90 and 87 respectively.\n\nThe McLaren-Honda cars had dominated the 1988 Formula One season like no one had before. With the Honda turbo, they clearly had the best engines, and with Senna and Prost, they had the two best drivers. It might have not been the most exciting and competitive F1 season for the sport as a whole or for McLaren either, but it was a season where they clearly got everything right. McLaren got the better of the rest of the grid. It is a season to be proud of.",

first-ever victory at this event and extending his current winning run to six races.</strong></p>\n<p>Norris jumped Verstappen for the lead at the start, with team mate Oscar Piastri almost following him through, meaning it was a Red Bull in a McLaren sandwich over the first few laps &#8211; but the reigning double world champion soon fought back.</p>\n<p><strong><a

Prix</a></strong></p>\n<p>By Lap 5, and with DRS at his disposal, Verstappen reclaimed P1 from Norris and never looked troubled, pulling away from the home favourite as the race developed and then managing a late Safety Car period &#8211; caused by Kevin Magnussen&#8217;s smoking Haas &#8211; that saw the leaders go for different tyre strategies.</p>\n<p>While the majority of the front-runners chose soft tyres under the Safety Car, Norris went for hards, meaning he had to pull off some impressive defending to remain P2 over fellow Briton Lewis Hamilton, who jumped Piastri when the race was neutralised.</p>\n<p>Piastri had held third for the majority of the 52-lap encounter, only to pit just before the aforementioned Safety Car, but fourth &#8211; a couple of seconds up on the other

to sixth after the Red Bull driver&#8217;s latest qualifying woes, making a series of late moves to finish ahead of Aston Martin&#8217;s Fernando Alonso, Williams&#8217; Alex Albon and the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz.</p>\n<p>Williams almost had two cars in the points on home soil, with Logan Sargeant a personal best 11th, followed by the Alfa Romeo of Valtteri Bottas, who started at the back after being excluded from qualifying, and Nico Hulkenberg, who dropped to the rear early on when he picked up front wing damage on his Haas.</p>\n<p>Lance Stroll wound up 14th after being penalised for causing a collision with Pierre Gasly, who was forced to retire thereafter, joining team mate Esteban Ocon, who pitted early on amid apparent technical trouble &#8211; and Magnussen on the sidelines.</p>\n<p>Zhou Guanyu was 15th in the other Alfa Romeo, having made three pit stops (one more than anyone else), with AlphaTauri pair Yuki Tsunoda and Nyck de Vries the final drivers to cross the line after Gasly&#8217;s aforementioned dramas.</p>\n<p>After the chequered flag, there was no hiding Verstappen&#8217;s excitement as he not only moved 99 points clear of Perez in the drivers&#8217; standings, but also gave Red Bull a record-equalling 11th successive F1 win.</p>\n\n    <h3>AS IT HAPPENED</h3>\n<p>A change to the starting grid post-qualifying saw Bottas dropped from 15th to 20th and last, having been excluded from the session after his Alfa Romeo stopped out on track in Q1 and the team failed to provide a sufficient fuel sample thereafter.</p>\n<p>As the drivers returned to Silverstone for race day, the rain seen in that grid-deciding session had cleared and been replaced by brighter skies, but the threat of further showers could not be counted out, while strong winds added to the challenge once again.</p>\n<p>A couple of minutes before the race start, the tyre blankets came off to reveal that most drivers had chosen medium tyres for their first stints, while Russell, Ocon, Tsunoda and De Vries chose softs and Hulkenberg and Bottas opted for hards.</p>\n<p>When the lights went out, Norris sent the home crowd wild as he bolted off the line and charged his way past Verstappen for the lead into Turn 1, with the Dutchman having to go defensive to keep the other McLaren of Piastri behind over the next few corners.</p>\n<p>Behind the top three runners, Leclerc held fourth from the fellow fast-starting Russell, who made the most of his soft tyres, with Sainz, Alonso, Gasly, Hamilton (having run wide and lost a place at Village) and Albon holding the final top 10 positions.</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"NORTHAMPTON, ENGLAND - JULY 09: Lando Norris of Great Britain driving the (4) McLaren MCL60\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        Norris stormed into the lead as the lights went out at Silverstone\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <p>Verstappen crucially stayed within a second of Norris to give him the benefit of DRS when the overtaking aid came into play on Lap 2 of 52 and, just five tours in, he reclaimed P1 by tucking in behind along the Wellington Straight and diving past into Brooklands.</p>\n<p>A few cars back, Russell and Sainz went wheel-to-wheel through Stowe, coming perilously close to contact, while the other Mercedes of Hamilton set about overhauling Alonso for P8, repeating Verstappen&#8217;s move on Norris on Lap 7.</p>\n<p>With Norris and Piastri back in the positions they started, the message from the McLaren pit wall was that the Australian rookie would hold station, as they looked to work together to keep Verstappen &#8211; who reported &#8220;weird pulling&#8221; on his car &#8211; in their sights.</p>\n<p>The first pit stop of the day went to Hulkenberg and Haas, but not for a strategic reason, with replays showing him losing a front wing endplate after the recovering Red Bull of Perez muscled his way past at The Loop for 13th position.</p>\n<p>Heading onto Lap 10, which saw Ocon pull into the pits and retire, Verstappen led Norris by

            "text": "Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen overcame an early attack from McLaren rival Lando Norris to triumph in an action-packed British Grand Prix, marking his first-ever victory at this event and extending his current winning run to six races. Norris jumped Verstappen for the lead at the start, with team mate Oscar Piastri almost following him through, meaning it was a Red Bull in a McLaren sandwich over the first few laps \u2013 but the reigning double world champion soon fought back. AS IT HAPPENED: Follow all the action from the 2023 British Grand Prix By Lap 5, and with DRS at his disposal, Verstappen reclaimed P1 from Norris and never looked troubled, pulling away from the home favourite as the race developed and then managing a late Safety Car period \u2013 caused by Kevin Magnussen\u2019s smoking Haas \u2013 that saw the leaders go for different tyre strategies. While the majority of the front-runners chose soft tyres under the Safety Car, Norris went for hards, meaning he had to pull off some impressive defending to remain P2 over fellow Briton Lewis Hamilton, who jumped Piastri when the race was neutralised. Piastri had held third for the majority of the 52-lap encounter, only to pit just before the aforementioned Safety Car, but fourth \u2013 a couple of seconds up on the other Mercedes of George Russell \u2013 still represented the best result of the Australian rookie\u2019s burgeoning F1 career.\n\nFORMULA 1 ARAMCO BRITISH GRAND PRIX 2023 Great Britain 2023 Race results POSITION TIME POINTS 1 Max Verstappen VER Red Bull Racing 1:25:16.938 26 2 Lando Norris NOR McLaren +3.798s 18 3 Lewis Hamilton HAM Mercedes +6.783s 15 4 Oscar Piastri PIA McLaren +7.776s 12 5 George Russell RUS Mercedes +11.206s 10\n\nSergio Perez delivered another solid recovery drive to sixth after the Red Bull driver\u2019s latest qualifying woes, making a series of late moves to finish ahead of Aston Martin\u2019s Fernando Alonso, Williams\u2019 Alex Albon and the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz. Williams almost had two cars in the points on home soil, with Logan Sargeant a personal best 11th, followed by the Alfa Romeo of Valtteri Bottas, who started at the back after being excluded from qualifying, and Nico Hulkenberg, who dropped to the rear early on when he picked up front wing damage on his Haas. Lance Stroll wound up 14th after being penalised for causing a collision with Pierre Gasly, who was forced to retire thereafter, joining team mate Esteban Ocon, who pitted early on amid apparent technical trouble \u2013 and Magnussen on the sidelines. Zhou Guanyu was 15th in the other Alfa Romeo, having made three pit stops (one more than anyone else), with AlphaTauri pair Yuki Tsunoda and Nyck de Vries the final drivers to cross the line after Gasly\u2019s aforementioned dramas. After the chequered flag, there was no hiding Verstappen\u2019s excitement as he not only moved 99 points clear of Perez in the drivers\u2019 standings, but also gave Red Bull a record-equalling 11th successive F1 win.\n\nAS IT HAPPENED A change to the starting grid post-qualifying saw Bottas dropped from 15th to 20th and last, having been excluded from the session after his Alfa Romeo stopped out on track in Q1 and the team failed to provide a sufficient fuel sample thereafter. As the drivers returned to Silverstone for race day, the rain seen in that grid-deciding session had cleared and been replaced by brighter skies, but the threat of further showers could not be counted out, while strong winds added to the challenge once again. A couple of minutes before the race start, the tyre blankets came off to reveal that most drivers had chosen medium tyres for their first stints, while Russell, Ocon, Tsunoda and De Vries chose softs and Hulkenberg and Bottas opted for hards. When the lights went out, Norris sent the home crowd wild as he bolted off the line and charged his way past Verstappen for the lead into Turn 1, with the Dutchman having to go defensive to keep the other McLaren of Piastri behind over the next few corners. Behind the top three runners, Leclerc held fourth from the fellow fast-starting Russell, who made the most of his soft tyres, with Sainz, Alonso, Gasly, Hamilton (having run wide and lost a place at Village) and Albon holding the final top 10 positions.\n\nNorris stormed into the lead as the lights went out at Silverstone\n\nVerstappen crucially stayed within a second of Norris to give him the benefit of DRS when the overtaking aid came into play on Lap 2 of 52 and, just five tours in, he reclaimed P1 by tucking in behind along the Wellington Straight and diving past into Brooklands. A few cars back, Russell and Sainz went wheel-to-wheel through Stowe, coming perilously close to contact, while the other Mercedes of Hamilton set about overhauling Alonso for P8, repeating Verstappen\u2019s move on Norris on Lap 7. With Norris and Piastri back in the positions they started, the message from the McLaren pit wall was that the Australian rookie would hold station, as they looked to work together to keep Verstappen \u2013 who reported \u201cweird pulling\u201d on his car \u2013 in their sights. The first pit stop of the day went to Hulkenberg and Haas, but not for a strategic reason, with replays showing him losing a front wing endplate after the recovering Red Bull of Perez muscled his way past at The Loop for 13th position. Heading onto Lap 10, which saw Ocon pull into the pits and retire, Verstappen led Norris by little more than a second, with Piastri a similar margin back, the trio in turn putting some breathing space between themselves and the Leclerc/Russell/Sainz gaggle behind.\n\nThis feature is currently not available because you need to provide consent to functional cookies.

With any showers holding off for the time being, Verstappen began to stretch his legs and bring his advantage over Norris up to three seconds, with the latter getting two lap times deleted for exceeding track limits and putting him at risk of a penalty. Perez\u2019s recovery drive continued at pace as he worked his way into the points by Lap 17 via moves on Stroll and Albon, making the Mexican \u2013 just over 20 seconds adrift of team mate and leader Verstappen \u2013 the biggest improver with five spots gained overall. Leclerc was the first of the front-runners to pit on Lap 19, swapping his mediums for a set of hards. \u201cI saw a Ferrari pit, I guess we just stick to our strategy?\u201d Verstappen asked the Red Bull pit wall in response, to which his engineer agreed. \u201cI\u2019m happy, it\u2019s consistent, I can maintain this for now,\u201d said Norris when asked for an update from the McLaren camp, though lap times several tenths slower than Verstappen meant the leader was now almost five seconds clear.\n\nVerstappen soon fought back against, and cleared, Norris to reclaim the lead\n\nNorris doubled down on those comments as the race approached the halfway mark, the majority appearing to go for a one-stop strategy, leaving Leclerc to provide the action as he worked his way back into the points on his alternate strategy. Sainz was the next front-runner to pit on Lap 27, moving to hards, with Russell (going to mediums) and Perez (going to softs) stopping two tours later \u2013 the Mercedes coming back out just behind the aforementioned Leclerc after an issue at the front-right. Then came some pit stop action from the sharp end as Piastri pitted on Lap 30, moving to hards and rejoining the action in sixth position, between Gasly and Albon, as attention turned to when team mate Norris and Verstappen would blink. Russell soon made up for his sluggish stop to clear Leclerc for P8 with a fine move at Luffield before Gasly and Stroll also took the opportunity to put on fresh tyres \u2013 Verstappen and Norris biding their time up front as they extended their stints. With Verstappen, Norris, Hamilton, Alonso and Albon all still yet to stop, the Virtual Safety Car was deployed when Magnussen ground to a halt in his smoking Haas on Lap 33.

Photo by HOCH ZWEI Montreal Canada *** Daniel Ricciardo AUS, Oracle Red Bull Racing , F1 Grand Prix of Canada at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on June 17, 2023 in Montreal, Canada Photo by HOCH ZWEI Montreal Canada\n\nIn a surprising twist to the ongoing Daniel Ricciardo F1 comeback saga, Red Bull Racing\u2019s motorsport consultant, Dr. Helmut Marko, has thrown a curveball by expressing interest in poaching a McLaren star instead. Speculations about potential driver changes are rife, with talk of major shifts at AlphaTauri and an intriguing possibility involving IndyCar sensation. As the F1 rumor mill churns, Ricciardo\u2019s hopes of a fairytale return to Red Bull Racing might have been dealt a significant blow.\n\nWhile rumors circulate about potential driver changes, Daniel Ricciardo\u2019s hopes of returning to Red Bull Racing seem dim. Despite the Australian driver expressing his desire for a fairytale ending to his career with the team, Red Bull\u2019s preference for new and young talent makes Ricciardo\u2019s comeback unlikely. Moreover, the recent resurgence of Sergio Perez, demonstrated by his impressive performance in the Austrian Grand Prix, raises questions about the need for a driver change at Red Bull Racing.\n\nRecent rumors suggest that Scuderia AlphaTauri could witness significant changes, not only for next season but possibly even during the current year. One name that has emerged is Alex Palou, the talented Indycar driver, who reportedly has a contractual window to make a leap to F1 before the opportunity closes. Palou drives for the Chip Ganassi team in IndyCar, but he is also part of the McLaren driver development program & has tested their F1 car as well.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nDr. Helmut Marko is said to be impressed by the Spaniard\u2019s skills and might offer him a seat at AlphaTauri when the Indycar season concludes in September. Such a move could pave the way for Palou\u2019s eventual transition to Red Bull Racing, as the team seeks a stronger second driver to support Max Verstappen\u2019s title ambitions.\n\nWhile speculation swirls around potential driver changes at Red Bull Racing and AlphaTauri, Max Verstappen offers advice to fellow driver Lando Norris, urging him to maintain faith in McLaren\u2019s ability to deliver a race-winning car.\n\nMax Verstappen\u2019s advice to Lando Norris: trust in McLaren\u2019s potential\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nAs Max Verstappen dominates the Formula 1 season, he shares advice with Lando Norris, urging him to keep faith in McLaren\u2019s ability to deliver a race-winning car. Norris, currently contracted with McLaren until 2026, faced suggestions that he might consider leaving the team due to their lackluster start to the campaign.

            "article_html": "<div><p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve never had this before,&#8221; says McLaren ambassador Kris. He is Autosport&#8217;s guide for an afternoon at the McLaren Technology Centre and just as he clears his throat to introduce the MP4/13 from 1998 in all its monochrome glory, Mika Hakkinen unexpectedly wanders into earshot. No pressure, then, to remember that the Finn standing only five yards away won eight grands prix aboard this car to lead a drivers&#8217; and constructors&#8217; Formula 1 championship double&#8230;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>Kris doesn&#8217;t miss a beat before Hakkinen steps into one of several cylindrical glass lifts, as conceived by ex-McLaren boss Ron Dennis and the MTC&#8217;s pre-eminent architect Norman Foster to mimic the pistons of an engine rising and falling. As it climbs, our guide notes that you won&#8217;t see any dangling wires since Dennis also specified the lifts operate hydraulically to banish anything that might be taken for mess or clutter.</p>\n<p>These 60 seconds from our three-hour visit perfectly captures the MTC in bitesize form. Opened in May 2004, it remains a pristine, state-of-the-art facility that truly merits every one of the countless comparisons to a James Bond villain&#8217;s lair. Yet, it&#8217;s anything but sterile and soulless, as motorsport history oozes from every chassis and trophy on display along the famous boulevard.</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>Remarkably, this is all something that members of the public can now experience as well. Despite the secrecy that shrouds F1 design and the development of the latest McLaren Automotive road cars, the MTC is opening its sliding door to fans. This comes courtesy of leading online travel booking platform GetYourGuide, as part of its &#8216;Originals by GetYourGuide&#8217; collection.</p>\n<p>GetYourGuide has been offering travel experiences for the last 14 years, providing over 75,000 experiences for in excess of 80million users from more than 150 countries. The company exists to create trips and visits that aren&#8217;t everyday experiences. It enables privileged access; hence you can book onto a private tour of the <a href=\"https://www.getyourguide.com/c/getyourguide-turning-the-lights-on-at-the-vatican-museums/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sistine Chapel</a> rather than join the usual queue round the block. Likewise, the App Store and Google Play app allows you to reserve a space for an after-hours tour, including a private organ performance at Barcelona&#8217;s breath-taking La Sagrada Familia.</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p>   <img src=\"https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/undefined-1686743196796.jpg\" alt=\"\"> \n<p class=\"title\">&#160;</p>\n<p class=\"photographer\">Photo by: GetYourGuide</p>\n<p>Having witnessed a major growth in demand following the COVID-19 pandemic, GetYourGuide has now expanded its Original experiences to sports venues. Alongside being shown around Madison Square Garden by a Hall of Famer, tours of the MTC - billed as the &#8220;crown jewel&#8221; in the ever-expanding GetYourGuide line-up - are now available to all.</p>\n<p>After turning off at Woking&#8217;s Paragon roundabout, which takes its name from the original working title for the MTC while it was under construction at the turn of the millennium, you are greeted by an immaculate landscape - as tended to by five ground staff. The building itself is initially concealed, so it&#8217;s a slow and tantalising reveal. You round the lake - and in Autosport&#8217;s case wait for a duck to cross the pathway - before being confronted with the grand design.</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>For 2023, there&#8217;s a splash of colour on the glass walls courtesy of some bright decals that celebrate McLaren&#8217;s diamond anniversary. It&#8217;s therefore fitting that the car that greets you on arrival is eponymous founder Bruce McLaren&#8217;s own 1929 Austin Seven race car. To mark the other end of the timeline, the reception desk is flanked by Lando Norris&#8217; current ride: the MCL60, complete in its &#8216;Triple Crown&#8217; homage special livery. Teasing the rest of the line-up along this walkway, the 1970 Can-Am title-winning ex-Denny Hulme M8D monster and its eight polished velocity stack &#8216;trumpets&#8217; rubs shoulders with the Gulf-painted McLaren F1 GTR Longtail.</p>\n<p>In the early years of the team, retired race cars were mostly sold to raise funds. But Dennis appreciated the power that race-winning heritage can play in energising a workforce, so he insisted McLaren start to keep hold of its old chargers while simultaneously buying back some of its greatest hits. New McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown, himself a passionate custodian of historic race cars, has kept this up. That&#8217;s why the MTC is so well populated today.</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>Pleasingly, though, these are no museum pieces under permanent lock and key. The cars are meticulously maintained so they can still be driven. They often serenade fans with runs up the Goodwood Festival of Speed Hillclimb or are sent over to the West Coast of America for Monterey Car Week at Laguna Seca.</p>\n   <img src=\"https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/undefined-1686743266687.jpg\" alt=\"\"> \n<p class=\"title\">&#160;</p>\n<p class=\"photographer\">Photo by: GetYourGuide</p>\n<p>You then amble past the symbols of modern-day McLaren: the three-seater Speedtail hyper GT, open-top Elva and even the all-electric Extreme E off-road racer. These are all on the walk to the Thought Leadership Centre. This ground-floor theatre is where the team launched its 2023 F1 car, while upstairs is the circular presentation room that made its silver screen debut in 2019&#8217;s Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw. With much of the MTC sitting underground, the 360-degree screens in this nerve centre can roll down to reveal windows that let the natural light flood in. As the MTC opens its doors to the public with GetYourGuide, this is also a room that can be hired and comes complete with its own caf&#233; -one that has the CNBC news channel playing in the background in deference to the F1 team&#8217;s TV network sponsor.</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>For the next part of our tour, phones and cameras must be briefly tucked away. Autosport is guided into the McLaren Production Centre, where all the latest Automotive creations are assembled. The row of carbon fibre tubs below the viewing platform gradually begin to resemble the new mid-engine hybrid Artura supercar the further down the line you cast your eye. That&#8217;s before they roll into the Monsoon and Dynamic test booths to ensure they are weatherproof and ready to be signed off for customer deliveries. It should be noted that even the trolley jacks are painted in traditional McLaren papaya&#8230;</p>\n<p>The only other place where guests must be careful with their photography is with the clear windows into the race bays, where two MCL60s are being built up for Norris and team-mate Oscar Piastri to drive ahead of the coming Canadian and Austrian GPs. But even if you can&#8217;t take a couple of snaps, there&#8217;s nothing to stop you from drinking in the detail of the fantastically intricate rear suspension and brake assemblies.</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>Piastri, on-site after flying back from the recent Spanish GP, tells Autosport: &#8220;Funnily enough, I had a tour of the MTC in 2018 when I was 17. I was just starting in Formula Renault Eurocup. It was a very cool place to be. Walking down the boulevard, even now, it never gets old seeing those cars. And because we have so many, the line-ups usually chop and change from week to week.&#8221;</p>\n   <img src=\"https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/undefined-1686743306077.jpg\" alt=\"\"> \n<p class=\"title\">&#160;</p>\n<p class=\"photographer\">Photo by: GetYourGuide</p>\n<p>As you navigate the MTC, the side corridors are also lined with F1 machinery. But these aren&#8217;t part of the rotating cast Piastri mentions. While the main boulevard is reserved for McLaren&#8217;s greatest hits, unpainted test cars and the less successful eras of the team (think the 2015-19 Honda and Renault-powered racers) are still held onto. But they&#8217;re out of the limelight.</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>By contrast, the trophies denoting every grand prix podium, win and championship title achieved are proudly on display. Whereas some rival teams opt to line their cabinets with replicas, McLaren has long written into driver contracts that the factory gets to keep the real thing. They are all present, polished, and correct, including the pot presented to Lewis Hamilton for winning the drivers&#8217; crown in 2008 - McLaren&#8217;s most recent title success.</p>\n<p>Just on from the trophy-lined walkway are four enormous towers. These hold 24,500 litres of water and will be used to cool the new F1 wind tunnel that is due to be completed imminently. As our tour comes to an end, Autosport can&#8217;t resist peering through one of the cooling louvres in the facilities&#8217; walls for a sneak peek at an infrastructure project conceived to guide McLaren back to the front of the grid.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is it,&#8221; Hakkinen tells Autosport in the final act of a truly special day. &#8220;This place is timeless when you come here. The people working here feel comfortable, they feel good. It&#8217;s motivating to work in an environment with such high quality. It is an incredible experience.&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.getyourguide.com/originals/exploring-the-world-of-mclaren-technology-centre\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">And thanks to GetYourGuide, a tour of the world-famous MTC is an experience that&#8217;s no longer reserved for two-time F1 world champions.</a></p>\n   <img src=\"https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/news/undefined-1686743333689.jpg\" alt=\"\"> \n<p class=\"title\">&#160;</p>\n<p class=\"photographer\">Photo by: GetYourGuide</p>\n<p id=\"ms-piano_article-prebanner\" class=\"ms-display-contents\"></p>\n\n    \n    <p class=\"ms-entity-detail-header_views\">\n                \n                    \n                \n                <p class=\"ms-entity-detail-header_views-value\"></p>\n            </p>\n        <p class=\"ms-share_inline \"></p>\n            \n            \n            <p class=\"ms-entity-detail-header_shares\">\n                <p class=\"ms-entity-detail-header_shares_value\"></p>\n                <p class=\"ms-entity-detail-header_shares_label\">shares</p>\n            </p>\n                         \n                    </div>",

As it climbs, our guide notes that you won\u2019t see any dangling wires since Dennis also specified the lifts operate hydraulically to banish anything that might be taken for mess or clutter.\n\nThese 60 seconds from our three-hour visit perfectly captures the MTC in bitesize form. Opened in May 2004, it remains a pristine, state-of-the-art facility that truly merits every one of the countless comparisons to a James Bond villain\u2019s lair. Yet, it\u2019s anything but sterile and soulless, as motorsport history oozes from every chassis and trophy on display along the famous boulevard.\n\nRemarkably, this is all something that members of the public can now experience as well. Despite the secrecy that shrouds F1 design and the development of the latest McLaren Automotive road cars, the MTC is opening its sliding door to fans. This comes courtesy of leading online travel booking platform GetYourGuide, as part of its \u2018Originals by GetYourGuide\u2019 collection.\n\nGetYourGuide has been offering travel experiences for the last 14 years, providing over 75,000 experiences for in excess of 80million users from more than 150 countries. The company exists to create trips and visits that aren\u2019t everyday experiences. It enables privileged access; hence you can book onto a private tour of the Sistine Chapel rather than join the usual queue round the block. Likewise, the App Store and Google Play app allows you to reserve a space for an after-hours tour, including a private organ performance at Barcelona\u2019s breath-taking La Sagrada Familia.\n\nPhoto by: GetYourGuide\n\nHaving witnessed a major growth in demand following the COVID-19 pandemic, GetYourGuide has now expanded its Original experiences to sports venues. Alongside being shown around Madison Square Garden by a Hall of Famer, tours of the MTC - billed as the \u201ccrown jewel\u201d in the ever-expanding GetYourGuide line-up - are now available to all.\n\nAfter turning off at Woking\u2019s Paragon roundabout, which takes its name from the original working title for the MTC while it was under construction at the turn of the millennium, you are greeted by an immaculate landscape - as tended to by five ground staff. The building itself is initially concealed, so it\u2019s a slow and tantalising reveal. You round the lake - and in Autosport\u2019s case wait for a duck to cross the pathway - before being confronted with the grand design.\n\nFor 2023, there\u2019s a splash of colour on the glass walls courtesy of some bright decals that celebrate McLaren\u2019s diamond anniversary. It\u2019s therefore fitting that the car that greets you on arrival is eponymous founder Bruce McLaren\u2019s own 1929 Austin Seven race car. To mark the other end of the timeline, the reception desk is flanked by Lando Norris\u2019 current ride: the MCL60, complete in its \u2018Triple Crown\u2019 homage special livery. Teasing the rest of the line-up along this walkway, the 1970 Can-Am title-winning ex-Denny Hulme M8D monster and its eight polished velocity stack \u2018trumpets\u2019 rubs shoulders with the Gulf-painted McLaren F1 GTR Longtail.\n\nIn the early years of the team, retired race cars were mostly sold to raise funds. But Dennis appreciated the power that race-winning heritage can play in energising a workforce, so he insisted McLaren start to keep hold of its old chargers while simultaneously buying back some of its greatest hits. New McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown, himself a passionate custodian of historic race cars, has kept this up. That\u2019s why the MTC is so well populated today.\n\nPleasingly, though, these are no museum pieces under permanent lock and key. The cars are meticulously maintained so they can still be driven. They often serenade fans with runs up the Goodwood Festival of Speed Hillclimb or are sent over to the West Coast of America for Monterey Car Week at Laguna Seca.\n\nPhoto by: GetYourGuide\n\nYou then amble past the symbols of modern-day McLaren: the three-seater Speedtail hyper GT, open-top Elva and even the all-electric Extreme E off-road racer. These are all on the walk to the Thought Leadership Centre. This ground-floor theatre is where the team launched its 2023 F1 car, while upstairs is the circular presentation room that made its silver screen debut in 2019\u2019s Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw. With much of the MTC sitting underground, the 360-degree screens in this nerve centre can roll down to reveal windows that let the natural light flood in. As the MTC opens its doors to the public with GetYourGuide, this is also a room that can be hired and comes complete with its own caf\u00e9 -one that has the CNBC news channel playing in the background in deference to the F1 team\u2019s TV network sponsor.\n\nFor the next part of our tour, phones and cameras must be briefly tucked away. Autosport is guided into the McLaren Production Centre, where all the latest Automotive creations are assembled. The row of carbon fibre tubs below the viewing platform gradually begin to resemble the new mid-engine hybrid Artura supercar the further down the line you cast your eye. That\u2019s before they roll into the Monsoon and Dynamic test booths to ensure they are weatherproof and ready to be signed off for customer deliveries. It should be noted that even the trolley jacks are painted in traditional McLaren papaya\u2026\n\nThe only other place where guests must be careful with their photography is with the clear windows into the race bays, where two MCL60s are being built up for Norris and team-mate Oscar Piastri to drive ahead of the coming Canadian and Austrian GPs. But even if you can\u2019t take a couple of snaps, there\u2019s nothing to stop you from drinking in the detail of the fantastically intricate rear suspension and brake assemblies.\n\nPiastri, on-site after flying back from the recent Spanish GP, tells Autosport: \u201cFunnily enough, I had a tour of the MTC in 2018 when I was 17. I was just starting in Formula Renault Eurocup. It was a very cool place to be. Walking down the boulevard, even now, it never gets old seeing those cars. And because we have so many, the line-ups usually chop and change from week to week.\u201d\n\nPhoto by: GetYourGuide\n\nAs you navigate the MTC, the side corridors are also lined with F1 machinery. But these aren\u2019t part of the rotating cast Piastri mentions. While the main boulevard is reserved for McLaren\u2019s greatest hits, unpainted test cars and the less successful eras of the team (think the 2015-19 Honda and Renault-powered racers) are still held onto. But they\u2019re out of the limelight.\n\nBy contrast, the trophies denoting every grand prix podium, win and championship title achieved are proudly on display. Whereas some rival teams opt to line their cabinets with replicas, McLaren has long written into driver contracts that the factory gets to keep the real thing. They are all present, polished, and correct, including the pot presented to Lewis Hamilton for winning the drivers\u2019 crown in 2008 - McLaren\u2019s most recent title success.\n\nJust on from the trophy-lined walkway are four enormous towers. These hold 24,500 litres of water and will be used to cool the new F1 wind tunnel that is due to be completed imminently. As our tour comes to an end, Autosport can\u2019t resist peering through one of the cooling louvres in the facilities\u2019 walls for a sneak peek at an infrastructure project conceived to guide McLaren back to the front of the grid.\n\n\u201cThis is it,\u201d Hakkinen tells Autosport in the final act of a truly special day. \u201cThis place is timeless when you come here. The people working here feel comfortable, they feel good. It\u2019s motivating to work in an environment with such high quality. It is an incredible experience.\u201d And thanks to GetYourGuide, a tour of the world-famous MTC is an experience that\u2019s no longer reserved for two-time F1 world champions.\n\nPhoto by: GetYourGuide",
