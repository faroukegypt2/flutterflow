first-ever victory at this event and extending his current winning run to six races.</strong></p>\n<p>Norris jumped Verstappen for the lead at the start, with team mate Oscar Piastri almost following him through, meaning it was a Red Bull in a McLaren sandwich over the first few laps &#8211; but the reigning double world champion soon fought back.</p>\n<p><strong><a

Prix</a></strong></p>\n<p>By Lap 5, and with DRS at his disposal, Verstappen reclaimed P1 from Norris and never looked troubled, pulling away from the home favourite as the race developed and then managing a late Safety Car period &#8211; caused by Kevin Magnussen&#8217;s smoking Haas &#8211; that saw the leaders go for different tyre strategies.</p>\n<p>While the majority of the front-runners chose soft tyres under the Safety Car, Norris went for hards, meaning he had to pull off some impressive defending to remain P2 over fellow Briton Lewis Hamilton, who jumped Piastri when the race was neutralised.</p>\n<p>Piastri had held third for the majority of the 52-lap encounter, only to pit just before the aforementioned Safety Car, but fourth &#8211; a couple of seconds up on the other Mercedes of George Russell &#8211; still represented the best result of the Australian rookie&#8217;s burgeoning F1 career.</p>\n\n    <p class=\"f1-sr--header f1-center\">\n                <h3

the sidelines.</p>\n<p>Zhou Guanyu was 15th in the other Alfa Romeo, having made three pit stops (one more than anyone else), with AlphaTauri pair Yuki Tsunoda and Nyck de Vries the final drivers to cross the line after Gasly&#8217;s aforementioned dramas.</p>\n<p>After the chequered flag, there was no hiding Verstappen&#8217;s excitement as he not only moved 99 points clear of Perez in the drivers&#8217; standings, but also gave Red Bull a record-equalling 11th successive F1 win.</p>\n\n    <h3>AS IT HAPPENED</h3>\n<p>A change to the starting grid post-qualifying saw Bottas dropped from 15th to 20th and last, having been excluded from the session after his Alfa Romeo stopped out on track in Q1 and the team failed to provide a sufficient fuel sample thereafter.</p>\n<p>As the drivers returned to Silverstone for race day, the rain seen in that grid-deciding session had cleared and been replaced by brighter skies, but the threat of further showers could not be counted out, while strong winds added to the challenge once again.</p>\n<p>A couple of minutes before the race start, the tyre blankets came off to reveal that most drivers had chosen medium tyres for their first stints, while Russell, Ocon, Tsunoda and De Vries chose softs and Hulkenberg and Bottas opted for hards.</p>\n<p>When the lights went out, Norris sent the home crowd wild as he bolted off the line and charged his way past Verstappen for the lead into Turn 1, with the Dutchman having to go defensive to keep the other McLaren of Piastri behind over the next few corners.</p>\n<p>Behind the top three runners, Leclerc held fourth from the fellow fast-starting Russell, who made the most of his soft tyres, with Sainz, Alonso, Gasly, Hamilton (having run wide and lost a place at Village) and Albon holding the final top 10 positions.</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"NORTHAMPTON, ENGLAND - JULY 09:

            "text": "Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen overcame an early attack from McLaren rival Lando Norris to triumph in an action-packed British Grand Prix, marking his first-ever victory at this event and extending his current winning run to six races. Norris jumped Verstappen for the lead at the start, with team mate Oscar Piastri almost following him through, meaning it was a Red Bull in a McLaren sandwich over the first few laps \u2013 but the reigning double world champion soon fought back. AS IT HAPPENED: Follow all the action from the 2023 British Grand Prix By Lap 5, and with DRS at his disposal, Verstappen reclaimed P1 from Norris and never looked troubled, pulling away from the home favourite as the race developed and then managing a late Safety Car period \u2013 caused by Kevin Magnussen\u2019s smoking Haas \u2013 that saw the leaders go for different tyre strategies. While the majority of the front-runners chose soft tyres under the Safety Car, Norris went for hards, meaning he had to pull off some impressive defending to remain P2 over fellow Briton Lewis Hamilton, who jumped Piastri when the race was neutralised. Piastri had held third for the majority of the 52-lap encounter, only to pit just before the aforementioned Safety Car, but fourth \u2013 a couple of seconds up on the other Mercedes of George Russell \u2013 still represented the best result of the Australian rookie\u2019s burgeoning F1 career.\n\nFORMULA 1 ARAMCO BRITISH GRAND PRIX 2023 Great Britain 2023 Race results POSITION TIME POINTS 1 Max Verstappen VER Red Bull Racing 1:25:16.938 26 2 Lando Norris NOR McLaren +3.798s 18 3 Lewis Hamilton HAM Mercedes +6.783s 15 4 Oscar Piastri PIA McLaren +7.776s 12 5 George Russell RUS Mercedes +11.206s 10\n\nSergio Perez delivered another solid recovery drive to sixth after the Red Bull driver\u2019s latest qualifying woes, making a series of late moves to finish ahead of Aston Martin\u2019s Fernando Alonso, Williams\u2019 Alex Albon and the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz. Williams almost had two cars in the points on home soil, with Logan Sargeant a personal best 11th, followed by the Alfa Romeo of Valtteri Bottas, who started at the back after being excluded from qualifying, and Nico Hulkenberg, who dropped to the rear early on when he picked up front wing damage on his Haas. Lance Stroll wound up 14th after being penalised for causing a collision with Pierre Gasly, who was forced to retire thereafter, joining team mate Esteban Ocon, who pitted early on amid apparent technical trouble \u2013 and Magnussen on the sidelines. Zhou Guanyu was 15th in the other Alfa Romeo, having made three pit stops (one more than anyone else), with AlphaTauri pair Yuki Tsunoda and Nyck de Vries the final drivers to cross the line after Gasly\u2019s aforementioned dramas. After the chequered flag, there was no hiding Verstappen\u2019s excitement as he not only moved 99 points clear of Perez in the drivers\u2019 standings, but also gave Red Bull a record-equalling 11th successive F1 win.\n\nAS IT HAPPENED A change to the starting grid post-qualifying saw Bottas dropped from 15th to 20th and last, having been excluded from the session after his Alfa Romeo stopped out on track in Q1 and the team failed to provide a sufficient fuel sample thereafter.

            "text": "Formula 1 takes a detour from Europe for the next round of the season with a hop across the Atlantic to Canada. Ahead of the weekend, Need to Know is your all-in-one guide with stats, trivia, insight and much more. You can also see how fans have voted using our F1 Play predictor game. The first two practice sessions at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve will take place on Friday, June 16, followed by final practice and qualifying on Saturday, June 17 and the Grand Prix itself on Sunday, June 18. IT\u2019S RACE WEEK: 5 storylines we\u2019re excited about ahead of the 2023 Canadian Grand Prix Vital statistics First Grand Prix \u2013 1967 (Mosport)\n\nTrack Length \u2013 4.361km\n\nLap record \u2013 1m 13.078s, Valtteri Bottas, Mercedes, 2019\n\nMost pole positions \u2013 Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton (6)\n\nMost wins \u2013 Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton (7)\n\nTrivia \u2013 Canada played host to the longest race in F1 history in 2011, with the clock stopping at four hours, four minutes and 39 seconds\n\nPole run to Turn 1 braking point \u2013 186 metres\n\nOvertakes completed in 2022 \u2013 51\n\nSafety Car probability \u2013 50%*\n\nVirtual Safety Car probability \u2013 50%*\n\nPit stop time loss \u2013 18.37 seconds *From the last six races in Canada FAN VIEW: Max Verstappen holds a clear advantage here in the F1 Play voting, with very few gamers believing he won\u2019t pick up another win this weekend. The Red Bull star is polling at around 90% right now, while interestingly, more like Mercedes rival Lewis Hamilton\u2019s chances than those of his team-mate, Sergio Perez.\n\nThe driver\u2019s verdict Jolyon Palmer, former Renault F1 driver: Canada is a really nice track to drive and you get a sense of atmosphere going around it. Overhanging trees give it the feel of a park and it feels like a street circuit \u2013 in essence, it is. There are a lot of slow-speed corners, the walls are very close in a lot of places, but it\u2019s a great racetrack. You need a good front-end to get your car turned into the chicanes, which are pretty much everywhere. THE FIRST WIN: David Tremayne remembers the magical day in Montreal when Lewis Hamilton became a Grand Prix winner Then there\u2019s the hairpin, which launches you into an overtaking area at the final chicane. If not there, maybe you\u2019ll have a little sniff of something into Turn 1. Turns 1 and 2 are pretty tricky because you\u2019re approaching Turn 1 very, very fast, arcing to the right as you\u2019re braking, and then hurling speed to the left. If you have any sort of moment coming to Turn 1, you\u2019re really off-line or cutting the corner down towards Turn 2. And tyre warm-up sometimes isn\u2019t ideal here, particularly on chillier days in Montreal.\n\nThis feature is currently not available because you need to provide consent to functional cookies.

The Dutchman has around 75% of the early votes, with Perez now a very distant second. There is support too, though, for Hamilton and the resurgent Mercedes.\n\nHamilton has won four of the last six F1 races held in Canada (2019 pictured)\n\nStrategy and set-up keys Bernie Collins, former Aston Martin F1 strategist: Canada is an outlier in the \u2018European season\u2019 to allow the event to be held in more favourable weather conditions and involves teams reverting to flyaway set-ups after several events in their normal motorhomes. That said, very variable weather has hit the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in previous visits, and it\u2019s common to see cold and wet days followed by hot and sunny ones \u2013 meaning a wide range of operating conditions to get to grips with. READ MORE: Inside the secret warehouse that\u2019s home to a treasure trove of historic McLaren F1 cars The long straights combined with low-speed corners promote a low downforce set-up requiring high straight-line speed. With this in mind, many teams have taken a new power unit to this event in the past due to the benefits of running fresh components.\n\nIn 2022, one Safety Car and two Virtual Safety Cars led to many drivers pitting twice, but the race is typically a one-stopper using the hardest compounds. It is generally quite difficult to overtake here, with tyre degradation low, while a related key trait is that the track features the shortest pit lane loss of the season. Another point for consideration is the high-speed approach to the pit entry, which sits alongside the final chicane, meaning drivers attempting an undercut while running close behind a rival car are likely to be forced to brake too early coming into the pit lane \u2013 a few tenths that could make all the difference as strategies play out. CANADA 2011: Torrential rain, a Safety Car record and Button\u2019s charge \u2013 the longest F1 race remembered by those involved FAN VIEW: The big thing to note here is that Hamilton has gone from being a podium outsider so far in 2023 to a virtual lock for Canada. He has more F1 Play votes than Fernando Alonso in the race to join the Red Bulls in the top three this weekend. Ferrari stars Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz are both seen as long shots.\n\nVerstappen took pole position and victory at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve last season\n\nCurrent form Red Bull maintained their 2023 unbeaten run as Verstappen cruised to victory in Spain \u2013 the team sitting 135 points clear of Mercedes in the constructors\u2019 standings and the Dutchman 53 points up on team mate Perez in the drivers\u2019 battle. However, it was Mercedes\u2019 first double podium finish of the season last time out that elevated them to P2 as Red Bull\u2019s nearest rivals, with the upgraded W14s \u2013 no longer featuring the \u2018zero-sidepod\u2019 concept \u2013 showing plenty of early promise.

There is also good support for Alfa Romeo\u2019s Zhou Guanyu \u2013 he was in the points in Spain and produced an excellent P8 finish in Canada last year.\n\nVerstappen and Red Bull continued their winning run in Spain, but Mercedes showed improved form\n\nIconic moment Robert Kubica was involved in a terrifying crash at the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix, experiencing an impact so big that it forced him to miss the next round of the season in the United States, where future four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel made a point-scoring F1 debut.

DRIVING STYLE: Zhou Guanyu reveals his style icons, his golden fashion rules \u2013 and why he needs a bigger wardrobe It would go down as Kubica\u2019s one and only Grand Prix win, with his and BMW Sauber\u2019s challenge for 2008 title glory fading as the year went on and rival teams out-developed them, but it remains a memorable moment for himself and his home country.

including the 70th Anniversary Grand Prix &#8211; while Perez&#8217;s best qualifying result at the track was last season&#8217;s fourth place.</p>\n<p>An upgraded floor and front wing helped <strong>Ferrari</strong> take a decent-sized step back in the right direction in last weekend&#8217;s Austrian Grand Prix, and their pace over one-lap was encouraging as Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz filled second and third on the grid behind Verstappen.</p>\n<p>Sainz took pole in last year&#8217;s British Grand Prix while Leclerc qualified third so, when you consider that the Prancing Horse are bringing more upgrades for this race, both cars should be in the mix by the end of Q3.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>#WhatOddsPaddy &#8211;

latest package fails to bring about a big improvement.</p>\n<p><strong>Sainz</strong> ran into a number of problems over the course of last weekend in Austria but still showed plenty of pace, and being demoted to sixth after post-race penalties were applied should serve as motivation for Silverstone.</p>\n<p>The 28-year-old delivered a mature performance in last year&#8217;s British Grand Prix to claim his maiden Formula 1 victory and I fancy him to finish on the podium for the first time this season.</p>\n<p><p class=\"widget-bet__odds\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t9/5\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"widget-bet__info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMax Verstappen to Win the Race &amp;

And that way, you can gain more confidence,\" he explained after ending the test third-fastest on Saturday.\n\n\"There's nothing fundamentally wrong with a car, so I think we managed to get the set-up quite nice in these three days.\n\n\"It's really nice to drive, so it's a good starting point, for sure.

This was a weakness last year, especially in the higher-speed corners, so that's good.</p>\n<p>\"Still we need to fine-tune the balance, especially as in the lower speed we are struggling a bit with locking up the fronts and then understeer.

            "text": "Following an encouraging opening day of running for the new C43 at the Bahrain pre-season test on Thursday, both Valtteri Bottas and Zhou Guanyu were left encouraged by some specific areas of progress made over the winter.\n\nBeyond some general aerodynamic and performance upgrades, the drivers are especially boosted by both reliability progress and more rear-end stability, issues that plagued the squad throughout 2022.\n\nSpeaking about areas where the car felt much better, Bottas said: \"Definitely the rear end of the car has become more stable. This was a weakness last year, especially in the higher-speed corners, so that's good.\n\n\"Still we need to fine-tune the balance, especially as in the lower speed we are struggling a bit with locking up the fronts and then understeer. But that is nothing we cannot solve.\"\n\nZhou said that improving the back end of the car had been a priority for the designers over the winter.\n\n\"It was kind of our main target,\" he said. \"We tried to solve it in the second half of the season but, as we solved it, we lost some car performance because of it. This year we have tried to get back the performance we had early in the season.\n\n\"High speed was the weakness we had last year. So we have tried to improve that, which seems to be working well. Now, it seems quite clear the improvement we were able to do.\"\n\nZhou Guanyu, Alfa Romeo C43 Photo by: Zak Mauger / Motorsport Images\n\nAs well as the car feeling better to drive, the reliable running that allowed Alfa Romeo to get through the day pretty much trouble-free was a huge boost.\n\nThe 138 laps both drivers completed were in total contrast to the limited running that hampered the team's first test at Barcelona last year.\n\nTwelve months ago, it did not manage to complete more than 100 laps per day throughout the opening Barcelona test, even being limited to 32 laps on the first day of running.\n\nBottas said that the reliability progress stood out for him as a critical step that the team appeared to have made.\n\n\"The main positive thing is that we didn't have a single issue, which is a huge contrast to testing last year,\" he said. \"So at least we started on the right foot and got some proper mileage which is, at this point, so important.\"\n\nAsked if he felt the reliability troubles that marred the team at many grands prix last year had been cured, Bottas said: \"I feel like all the main issues we had last year from the chassis side were well identified.\n\n\"Many of the concepts were changed, like for example the cooling where we had multiple issues. And at least [the first day] shows that we can do more than two race distances without issues. That's good.\n\n\"So, I'm confident it's going to be definitely better than last year. And obviously, we did have quite a few issues from the Ferrari side last year. But so far, nothing.\"",

In 2022 the team finished sixth in the world championship, its best result for a decade.\n\nAs CEO, Vasseur also played a key role in the sale of the Sauber organisation to Audi, who will enter F1 under the new power unit rules in 2026.\n\nThe appeal of running Ferrari rather than leading Sauber through three interim seasons before the full Audi takeover proved irresistible to Vasseur.\n\nIn a statement the team paid tribute to its departing boss, making it clear that he will be missed.\n\nVasseur departs with the good wishes of the Sauber organisation behind Alfa Romeo's F1 operation Photo by: Alfa Romeo\n\nThe team said: \u201cFrederic Vasseur leaves a team bolstered by new partners, a growing workforce and with a bright future as the works team for a manufacturer in the not-too-far distance.\n\n\u201cHe leaves as a friend, a mentor, a boss that could extract the best out of his charges.\n\n\u201cAnd, as we enter a new chapter of the history of our team, we will miss the smiles and jokes that would accompany him as he did the rounds in our Hinwil HQ.\n\n\u201cMerci, Fred, et bonne chance. We\u2019ll be cheering for you wherever you go next.\u201d\n\nVasseur stressed that he has enjoyed his stint with the team, suggesting that it was good preparation for his future job.\n\n\u201cAs I prepare to bring my adventure at Alfa Romeo to an end, I can look back fondly at these six years together,\u201d he said. \u201cI owe a debt of gratitude to every single employee of the team, as they are the ones who got this team back on their feet and climbing the ladder of our sport.\n\n\u201cI am proud of the job we collectively have done as a team and a company, and even more so of the strong foundations we have laid for what\u2019s to come next.

Zhou has seven retirements this season, tied for the most in Formula 1, and Bottas has five. Eight of those 12 retirements have been caused by something other than a crash.</p><p>After Bottas started the season with seven top nine finishes in nine races, he hasn&#8217;t scored since, and during his nine-race scoreless streak, Zhou has only managed a single point. Because of his strong start, Bottas still sits in 10th place in the <a href=\"http://beyondtheflag.com/formula-one-standings\">driver standings</a>. Zhou sits in 18th.</p><p>Alfa Romeo still sit in sixth place in the <a href=\"http://beyondtheflag.com/formula-one-standings/2\">constructor standings</a>, and if they finish there, it would mark a three-place improvement from last year, which would still make them the most improved team in the first season of this new era of rules and regulations.</p><p>However, things have tightened up between Alfa Romeo, Aston Martin, Haas, and AlphaTauri, with just 18 points blanketing the four teams in this fight.</p><p>&#8220;Need to get some points,&#8221; Bottas told <a href=\"http://beyondtheflag.com\">Beyond the Flag</a> when asked about his goals for the final four races of the 2022 season.</p><p>The season&#8217;s four final races include the United States Grand Prix at Circuit of the Americas (Sunday, October 23), the Mexico City Grand Prix at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez (Sunday, October 30), the Sao Paulo Grand Prix at Interlagos Circuit (Sunday, November 6), and the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix at Yas Marina Circuit (Sunday, November 13).</p><p>&#8220;I think now, as a team, we need to secure sixth place in the constructors, which already is a step forward from the last two years; the team was ninth,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;That&#8217;s the goal for this year. But of course, in the future, we definitely want more. Just having clean, consistent races, scoring points in all of the remaining races; that&#8217;s the goal.&#8221;</p><p>Bottas remains optimistic about next season as well. He believes that the one glaring issue of lack of reliability is something that can be avoided with more testing time.</p><p>Before the start of this season, <a href=\"https://us.motorsport.com/f1/news/bottas-alfa-romeo-understands-issues-that-limited-f1-test-mileage/8436489/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alfa Romeo experienced unexpected issues which ultimately limited their time spent testing</a>, and that has had somewhat of a domino effect on their season.</p><p>&#8220;As a team, we&#8217;ve had quite a few reliability issues this year, partly because the winter testing we had was so limited,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We had many issues, so we didn&#8217;t get the mileage in the car, and when you don&#8217;t get the mileage in testing, then issues can appear later on in the year with certain parts.</p><p>&#8220;So obviously next year is going to be a new car again that we&#8217;ve been designing and soon producing at the factory in Switzerland. Hopefully the new car is fast and reliable, and that way we can definitely make a step forward.&#8221;</p>  </div>",

Zhou sits in 18th.\n\nAlfa Romeo still sit in sixth place in the constructor standings, and if they finish there, it would mark a three-place improvement from last year, which would still make them the most improved team in the first season of this new era of rules and regulations.\n\nHowever, things have tightened up between Alfa Romeo, Aston Martin, Haas, and AlphaTauri, with just 18 points blanketing the four teams in this fight.\n\n\u201cNeed to get some points,\u201d Bottas told Beyond the Flag when asked about his goals for the final four races of the 2022 season.\n\nThe season\u2019s four final races include the United States Grand Prix at Circuit of the Americas (Sunday, October 23), the Mexico City Grand Prix at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez (Sunday, October 30), the Sao Paulo Grand Prix at Interlagos Circuit (Sunday, November 6), and the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix at Yas Marina Circuit (Sunday, November 13).\n\n\u201cI think now, as a team, we need to secure sixth place in the constructors, which already is a step forward from the last two years; the team was ninth,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s the goal for this year. But of course, in the future, we definitely want more. Just having clean, consistent races, scoring points in all of the remaining races; that\u2019s the goal.\u201d\n\nBottas remains optimistic about next season as well. He believes that the one glaring issue of lack of reliability is something that can be avoided with more testing time.\n\nBefore the start of this season, Alfa Romeo experienced unexpected issues which ultimately limited their time spent testing, and that has had somewhat of a domino effect on their season.\n\n\u201cAs a team, we\u2019ve had quite a few reliability issues this year, partly because the winter testing we had was so limited,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had many issues, so we didn\u2019t get the mileage in the car, and when you don\u2019t get the mileage in testing, then issues can appear later on in the year with certain parts.\n\n\u201cSo obviously next year is going to be a new car again that we\u2019ve been designing and soon producing at the factory in Switzerland. Hopefully the new car is fast and reliable, and that way we can definitely make a step forward.\u201d",

            "text": "An Alfa Romeo driver won the very first Formula 1 championship way back in 1950, when the Italian marque was a powerhouse in European racing. They may have incredible motor sport heritage, but these days the brand's F1 team is operated by the Sauber Group, and their current ambitions are more about mixing it in the midfield than fighting for titles. Here's your guide to the Hinwil based outfit, ahead of the new 2023 campaign... Drivers for 2023 Valtteri Bottas #77: 10 Grand Prix wins, 67 podiums, 1787 points, 200 Grands Prix starts\n\nZhou Guanyu #24: 6 points, best finish of P8, 22 Grands Prix starts Valtteri Bottas made his F1 debut with Williams in 2013 and joined Mercedes \u2013 where he won five consecutive constructors\u2019 championships \u2013 in 2017. The Finnish driver was replaced by George Russell for 2022 and Bottas therefore joined Alfa Romeo, in turn replacing fellow Finn Kimi Raikkonen who was retiring. The team employed the services of then-rookie Zhou Guanyu, who became the first full-time Chinese driver in F1 after finishing third in the 2021 Formula 2 Championship. Alfa Romeo announced in September 2022 that they would retain Zhou for another season alongside Bottas, who was reported in 2021 to have signed a multi-year deal with the team.\n\nValtteri Bottas (L) and Zhou Guanyu (R) continue in their second season as Alfa Romeo team mates\n\nLast season After scoring points just six times in 2021, Alfa Romeo began 2022 \u2013 the new era of F1 \u2013 in much stronger fashion. Zhou scored on his debut with P10 while Bottas managed P6 in Bahrain, with the Finn going on to score five more times in the next six races. Zhou joined Bottas in the points once again in Canada as the team logged their second double points finish of 2022. HEAD-TO-HEAD: Which drivers came out on top in the battle of the 2022 team mates? But that would be their last double points haul as a double retirement, including a huge crash for Zhou, followed at Silverstone and more trouble hit for Bottas in Hungary, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Italy brought another point thanks to Zhou but it was clear that Alfa Romeo\u2019s early-season form had faded; from rounds 11-22 they scored just four of their 55 points total for the season and ended up level in score with Aston Martin. Sixth in the championship was their reward over Aston as Bottas boasted the best race finish out of the four drivers from the two teams.\n\nAston Martin drew level with Alfa Romeo in the tail end of 2022 \u2013 but Alfa just managed to cling on to P6 in the constructors'\n\nHistory You can\u2019t mention Alfa Romeo without mentioning the likes of Giuseppe Farina, Juan Manuel Fangio, and Luigi Fagioli. The marque dominated the first two World Championship seasons of Formula 1 but withdrew at the end of the 1951 season, before supplying privateers with engines in the mid-1960s and early 1970s. In 1976 Alfa supplied the Brabham team with engines, before the Italian marque returned as constructors in their own right from 1979-85 \u2013 leaving the sport when the Fiat Group purchased the company in 1986.

And of course with his expertise, and also a different point of view of a different way to manage things, this is very important. We need to challenge ourselves.\n\n\u201cI think it's a teamwork that has started in a very positive way. And we are all happy to start delivering this season.\u201d\n\nAlfa Romeo will be boosted by a partnership with Audi Photo by: Alfa Romeo\n\nThe fact that Alunni Bravi has not been named team principal suggests that perhaps someone else could yet be appointed, and that he will then step sideways.\n\nANALYSIS: Why Audi\u2019s distant future in F1 is already helping Alfa Romeo\n\nOne could speculate that Audi plans to eventually put a company insider in that role \u2013 Allan McNish would be one obvious candidate \u2013 but with the team still running as Alfa Romeo, it\u2019s too early to do so. However, Alunni Bravi insists that the team isn\u2019t yet looking that far ahead.\n\n\u201cWe are focused on 2023, really. We know that we need to deliver our job now, we are focused on the overall performance of the team. We know that the work we do on a daily basis will also shape our future. But we need to work and be focused on the day-by-day. We have a lot of work ahead of us.\n\n\"For me the biggest challenge is to push the button and to start the 2023 season. And then from time to time, we will think about the future. But the future you build each day, delivering your best, being focused on what you do. This is the best way to build the future, to focus on the daily business.\u201d\n\nAlfa finished sixth in last year\u2019s championship, just pipping Aston Martin, but well behind McLaren and Alpine. Where might the team lie when this year\u2019s midfield battle shakes out?\n\n\u201cWe don't target a result for this year,\u201d Alunni Bravi insists. \u201cFor every team it\u2019s very difficult to know where we stand ahead of the start of the season. But our target during the wintertime has been to analyse the 2022 season and to address all our weaknesses and to fix them.\n\n\u201cOnly the track will say if we have been doing the right work, but the target for sure is to improve the overall performance. Which means for us to solve the reliability issues that we had last year, to be consistent throughout all the season.\n\n\"And then at the end of the season, we will see where we will be.\"",

READ MORE: The 5 key questions from 2023 pre-season testing in Bahrain\n\n10. Williams\n\nSmooth sailing for Williams rookie Logan Sargeant and his new team mate in Bahrain\n\nWilliams' only reliability concern over the three days of pre-season testing was a small electrical issue, as rookie Logan Sargeant and team mate Alex Albon notched up an impressive 439 laps of the Bahrain International Circuit, which is as good a return as they could hope for. As for the performance of the FW45, Albon said the car was \"definitely quicker\" than last year's version. Whether we saw the true potential of it last week remains to be seen, and right now they sit at the bottom of the Power Rankings. That doesn't mean they haven't improved; it means there might be more to come from the sleeping giants. WINNERS AND LOSERS: Who aced 2023 F1 pre-season testing and who has work to do ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix? 9. Haas\n\nHaas notched 414 laps over the three days, with the team's fastest tour set by Kevin Magnussen\n\nHaas got some solid running on the board as Kevin Magnussen set the seventh-fastest time of testing on Day 3 and Nico Hulkenberg got his eye in once again. Test driver Pietro Fittipaldi said the team were around P5-P7 in the charts but our data might hint that, at this stage before the opening Grand Prix, they're perhaps not at the level of Alpine and Aston Martin \u2013 but this midfield is so competitive that a small swing in their favour could go a long way. Furthermore, Haas seem to enjoy Bahrain \u2013 it's where Magnussen pulled off his \"Viking comeback\" in 2022... BARRETTO: Testing has given us a fascinating insight into the pecking order for 2023 \u2013 but the full story is going to be even juicier 8. AlphaTauri\n\nAlphaTauri finished ninth in last year's standings \u2013 can they move up the order this season?\n\nAlphaTauri led the mileage stakes in Bahrain with 456 laps of the circuit that will also host this weekend's season-opener. Yuki Tsunoda and rookie team mate Nyck de Vries clearly encountered no bugs with their AT04, but the team's pace was hard to read as Tsunoda managed a fast flying lap only at the end of the third day \u2013 which might have been a low-fuel quali run. So we haven't had a proper read on the Faenza team's pace, but our preliminary data hints that they're only just above Haas and Williams in the stakes. Again, the same caveats as above apply in this tight midfield scrap. ANALYSIS: How do McLaren, Haas, AlphaTauri and more stack up after pre-season testing in Bahrain? 7. McLaren\n\nNot the ideal start for McLaren, who pushed for P4 in the standings last season\n\nMcLaren were one of the surprises from pre-season testing, and not for the reasons they would have liked. The team in orange seemed to struggle with aerodynamic efficiency and further issues sprung up at the front of the car with their front wheel brows needing strengthening, which hampered rookie Oscar Piastri and team mate Lando Norris. As a result, McLaren managed just 312 laps over the three days and our data put them in the bottom half. Perhaps they didn't get a representative quali or race run in, but it's not a great start for the Woking team.

Alfa Romeo\n\nA brace of red flag-triggering issues aside, Alfa Romeo have cause to smile\n\nAlfa Romeo's Zhou Guanyu topped the timesheets on Day 2 with a run on C5 tyres and it would really be something if they do that again in qualifying this Saturday. It's fair to assume that this was not a lap worth reading too much into and our data backs that up, putting Alfa Romeo in the midfield battle. But there are reasons to be optimstic for Alfa Romeo and fans of Valtteri Bottas and Zhou, because it does look like they've made some improvements over last year. Two significant reliability issues during the three days of testing might be reason for concern, however. WATCH: Jolyon Palmer\u2019s testing takeaways after three busy days in Bahrain 5. Alpine\n\nMore to come from last year's midfield-toppers Alpine?\n\nAlpine were bullish during launch season with their engineers showing off numerous aero changes and talking of a significant decrease in weight, but the team didn't seem to show their hand in testing: there were no blistering glory runs and their long runs were hard to read. New signing Pierre Gasly hinted that there was pace in the A523 but that race simulation on the final day was interrupted by a red flag. So our data put the team that finished fourth in last year's constructors' standings one step lower in this year's pre-season Power Rankings. VOTE: Which of the 10 teams impressed you most in 2023 pre-season testing? 4. Aston Martin\n\nAston Martin turned heads in Bahrain testing\n\nAston Martin's AMR23 looks like a big step up from last year's car, which saw the team finish seventh in the standings. Our data puts them fourth in the rankings before the opening Grand Prix \u2013 is that an outlandish or realistic expectation for Lance Stroll and Fernando Alonso? Well, Haas driver Magnussen and Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner have already pointed at Aston Martin as this year's most-improved in testing. It would be far-fetched to expect a Red Bull-beating display from Aston Martin but long runs and short runs were both favourable over the three days. Fernando Alonso was particularly fast and reserve driver Felipe Drugovich was no slouch as he replaced the injured Stroll in testing.

Mercedes\n\nPerhaps Mercedes have more in the tank \u2013 we'll see how they fare soon\n\nSome predictions have put Mercedes behind Aston Martin but our data hints that they might just hold the advantage over the midfield leaders. The eight-time constructors' champions did have a couple of reliability hiccups during the three days of testing, and as the session unfolded they looked a lot happier about their performance. Day 1 wasn't a disaster for the Silver Arrows but only on Friday and Saturday did Lewis Hamilton and George Russell find their feet in the unconventionally-designed W14. They have made strides over 2022 but they're behind Ferrari in our Power Rankings. Although team Principal Toto Wolff hints that there's more to come...

Ferrari\n\nFerrari's boss said the mood in the Scuderia camp was \"perfect\" after 3 days in Bahrain\n\nFerrari set some competitive times, briefly topping sessions throughout the weekend \u2013 but their rivals Red Bull eclipsed them. Furthermore, our data showed that the team in rosso were around the level of Mercedes and, at times, Aston Martin. Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc did have positive things to say about the balance of the SF-23 but as always, Ferrari kept their cards close to their chest. Those positive remarks centered around how \"smooth\" three days in Bahrain went. Last year, we saw Ferrari win the first race of the season at the same circuit as Red Bull were hit by reliability concerns. Will the Scuderia be able to make a winning start again this year?

The weeks leading up to the start of the new season are indeed a crucial phase, experienced with total intensity and concentration. These are days of strong emotions, adrenaline-pumping anticipation, mental and physical preparation. But none of this transpires externally. That is why Alfa Romeo offers \u201cbeyond the visible,\u201d reporting everything that precedes the highly anticipated inaugural race of the world championship. During the weeks leading up to the event, motivation, passion and focus become the key to pursuing one common goal: speed. Protagonists of the first episode are the managers of a team who work hard to define strategies and goals aimed at getting the most out of the group, continuing motivation at the highest level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can watch the first episode here.\n\nAlfa Romeo F1 Team ORLEN | Beyond the visible | Episode 1 | Before we hit the ground\n\nMany of the DTS-style \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d documentaries we\u2019ve seen from other series or teams haven\u2019t really compared with the original product for a variety of reasons, but Beyond the Visible comes close. Its high production quality and first-person narration sets it apart from the rest (even though there\u2019s a filter casting a weird hue over everything, giving off both Instagram filter and horror movie vibes, and a heavy emphasis on brands and heritage). Beyond the Visible feels really artsy, which is nice.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe episodes are also pretty short \u2014 this first one clocks in at just under nine minutes \u2014 so you can sneak in a peep at your desk while your boss isn\u2019t watching.

            "article_html": "<div><h3>Red Bull</h3>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t a trouble-free first day for Red Bull in Miami. Verstappen complained about his headrest at times as he had done in Baku, but in FP2 looked very quick indeed and wound up on top by an eye-watering 0.385s. Perez locked up and ran wide on a couple of occasions, but from being off the pace in FP1, at least dragged himself back into contention in the second session. But on current form, it will be Verstappen that is favourite heading into qualifying day.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.verstappen-enjoys-friday-practice-after-topping-fp2-while-team-mate-perez.29O3PIzYk1TJlkmlYfJztX.html\">READ MORE: Verstappen enjoys Friday practice after topping FP2 while team mate Perez laments tough start in Miami</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Max Verstappen - FP1: 1:30.549, P4; FP2: 1:27.930, P1</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Today was a good day. Initially we were getting used to the track with the new tarmac, it was ramping up a lot throughout the day. It&#8217;s still quite slippery off line but on the driving line it&#8217;s okay. Most importantly today we had good balance in the car so I feel happy. There are still a few things we want to look at overnight, ideally we want to be faster on every corner, which isn&#8217;t always possible. We&#8217;ll have to see what the weather will do tomorrow, but overall it&#8217;s been a positive day.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Sergio Perez - FP1: 1:31.566, P11; FP2: 1:28.419, P4</strong></p>\n<p>\"The conditions out there aren&#8217;t great, especially the grip in FP1, it felt like inter to wet tyre conditions. Getting a read in these low grip conditions is tricky but there are only very small margins to ensure we make improvements. We have been trying some stuff with the mechanical balance and I think we learnt quite a bit. I haven&#8217;t had the greatest of Fridays. On one of my flying laps I locked up on the final corner and then on the long run I don&#8217;t think we managed to get too much of a read on the laps we got in. So, I still have quite a bit to come, together with my driving because I was not driving very well today. If I am able to improve my driving and get myself a bit more comfortable, I should be alright.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05: Max Verstappen of the Netherlands driving the (1) Oracle Red Bull Racing\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05: Sergio Perez of Mexico driving the (11) Oracle Red Bull Racing RB19 on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05: Max Verstappen of the Netherlands driving the (1) Oracle Red Bull Racing RB19 on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Miami at Miami International Autodrome on May 05, 2023 in Miami, Florida.

They did fall back in FP2, but Russell caught traffic on his flying lap while Hamilton didn&#8217;t seem to be pushing flat out. More to come from them.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.its-a-kick-in-the-gut-hamilton-left-frustrated-as-mercedes-tumble-down-the.4KkFfyKxoKjJU2rlLMIXVy.html\">READ MORE: &#8216;It&#8217;s a kick in the gut&#8217; &#8211; Hamilton left frustrated as Mercedes tumble down the Friday practice timesheets in Miami</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Lewis Hamilton &#8211; FP1: 1:30.337, P2; FP2: 1:28.858, P7</strong></p>\n<p>\"I&#8217;m going to stay optimistic and hopeful that we can get the car in a better place for tomorrow, and maybe be a couple of positions further forward than today. We weren&#8217;t particularly quick, and it was a struggle out there. The grip is quite low on this new surface. It is slippery, particularly for the rear-end. The track temperature today was very high so there was lots of sliding.</p>\n<p>\"FP1 looked quite good but our pace in FP2 was a kick in the guts. We&#8217;re trying lots of different things and we&#8217;ll keep working on it. We&#8217;ll regroup tonight, see if we can make some set-up changes and get the car in a better sweet spot. It&#8217;s a great weekend here and a great place to be so there are still positives.\"</p>\n<p><strong>George Russell - FP1: 1:30.125, P1; FP2: 1:29.216, P15</strong></p>\n<p>\"Today didn&#8217;t feel too dissimilar to last year here in Miami. In 2022, we were fastest on Friday but then knocked out in Q2 on Saturday. This year, the car changed even during the session. FP1 was a bit of a messy hour but we ended fastest. In FP2, I felt strong on the medium run but when we put the soft tyre on, the car wasn&#8217;t working for me. We understand a little bit why that is and fortunately, we&#8217;ve got the time to make improvements overnight. It&#8217;s fine margins out there.</p>\n<p>\"I think going into Sunday there will be a few unknowns. The track has been resurfaced this year but it&#8217;s still not performing like another circuit. It&#8217;s a true outlier. I think that&#8217;s cool in some regards, but it could be difficult to race on. You can&#8217;t afford to drive offline as you lose all grip.</p>\n<p>\"Looking at Saturday, if everything is right then there&#8217;s no reason we can&#8217;t be ahead of Ferrari and Aston Martin. As we&#8217;ve seen at the first four races, it&#8217;s very tight between all three teams. If we maximise everything, we can be rewarded and jump ahead of them. We know we&#8217;ve got the potential, but we need to improve overnight.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director</strong></p>\n<p>\"Our programme in FP1 was offset compared to others, so the headline times flattered us to some degree. Nevertheless, we clearly had the car in a nice window and both drivers found that the lap time came quite easily. We made some subtle changes to the car before FP2, but it immediately become apparent that in cooler conditions the car was more of handful on new tyres. The red flag for Leclerc&#8217;s crash meanwhile meant that everyone was limited to only a few laps on high fuel. From the running we did get, our pace in that aspect looks OK. It&#8217;s going to be difficult to overtake here though so we must improve our single lap balance this evening, otherwise we will face a frustrating Sunday. As usual, we have the support of our factory overnight and we&#8217;ve got a good read on the issues from today, so we know what to work on.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05: George Russell of Great Britain driving the (63) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W14 on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Miami at Miami International Autodrome on May 05, 2023 in Miami, Florida.

They did show a bit more form in second practice, but as of yet not enough to place them in the battle for pole. That being said, Stroll went well at this track last year and Alonso seemed comfortable from the off, so they can&#8217;t be totally discounted.</p>\n<p><strong>Fernando Alonso &#8211; FP1: 1:31.231, P7; FP2: 1:28.660, P5</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a relatively routine Friday practice for us after the different format in Baku. We&#8217;ve had more time on track to learn about the car and the tyres this weekend, despite some red flags disrupting the sessions. So far, I think the new track surface seems to be better, but we were basically just cleaning the racing line today. It seems when you move away from it, it&#8217;s very slippery &#8211; so that could make overtaking difficult. Qualifying tomorrow is important, but our strength is normally on Sunday, so we&#8217;ll see what we can do.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Lance Stroll - FP1: 1:31.337, P8; FP2: 1:28.930, P8</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We made the most of both practice sessions today and came away with a better understanding of how the changes to the track will impact our running. We know it will be incredibly hot here &#8211; probably the hottest track temperatures of the year &#8211; so tyre degradation will be a big factor and something we need to monitor across the weekend. But the car felt good; we made some changes after FP1 which improved performance for FP2, so I&#8217;m feeling positive heading into Saturday.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05: Fernando Alonso of Spain driving the (14) Aston Martin AMR23 Mercedes on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05: Lance Stroll of Canada and Aston Martin F1 Team prepares to drive in the\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05: Fernando Alonso of Spain driving the (14) Aston Martin AMR23 Mercedes on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Miami at Miami International Autodrome on May 05, 2023 in Miami, Florida.

Norris looked very quick in FP2, topping the timing sheets at one stage and winding up in the mix with the big four teams. Piastri couldn&#8217;t quite match that and wound up down the order. But the team often keep their cards close to their chest on Fridays, so tomorrow could be a different story.</p>\n<p><strong>Lando Norris - FP1: 1:31.997, P16; FP2: 1:28.741, P6</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a reasonable first day in Miami, I think we made a couple of small improvements between FP1 and FP2, which was good, hopefully we can try to go further in that direction for tomorrow. As Friday goes, I'm pretty happy, I think we found a slightly better balance with the car. We are struggling in a few areas of the track, so we&#8217;ll focus on improving that, get a bit more confidence in the car and aim for Q3 in qualifying tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Oscar Piastri - FP1: 1:31.810, P12; FP2: 1:29.339, P16</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;A useful first day of racing in Miami. We learnt a lot on what was quite a tricky track surface and temperature for FP1. In FP2 the track gripped up and got a lot faster, and we have some work to do to adapt to that. We were trying a few things throughout the session but we&#8217;re still working on it. It&#8217;s not been a bad day, but we&#8217;ve got plenty to look over for tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Andrea Stella, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Today was a productive day. We worked through our programme of understanding the new surface of this track, and the behaviour of the tyres, both over a single lap and longer runs. We also did some useful work on set-up. Overall, we seem to be able to compete for Q3 and for points, but once again we can see the midfield is very compact. We&#8217;ll study the data overnight and come back tomorrow, trying to maximise our performance for qualifying and the race.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05: Lando Norris of Great Britain and McLaren prepares to drive in the garage\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05: Oscar Piastri of Australia driving the (81) McLaren MCL60 Mercedes on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05: Lando Norris of Great Britain and McLaren prepares to drive in the garage during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Miami at Miami International Autodrome on May 05, 2023 in Miami, Florida.

They were in and around the top 10 which is encouraging, but did confirm that they would be using all three practice sessions to assess their upgrades. As such, they weren&#8217;t necessarily running representative fuel loads, so they are another team who may well spring a surprise come qualifying.</p>\n<p><strong>Esteban Ocon - FP1: 1:31.542, P10; FP2: 1:28.930, P9</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Firstly, it&#8217;s great to be back driving in this iconic city and it&#8217;s always a pleasure racing in the United States. For us, it was a smooth day on track overall and it was good to have two full sessions to work on the set-up of the car. Today was a day of data gathering, and really looking into how the track and surface feel, and how the tyres behave. I have to say the organisers did a great job as the tarmac is much better than last year. We still have one more Practice session and some work to do to fine-tune our car before Qualifying. I am definitely looking forward to seeing what we can do and hopefully we can be in the mix for a strong result.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Pierre Gasly - FP1: 1:31.104, P6; FP2: 1:29.098, P11</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was important for us to have a clean and uneventful day in the car and I think we&#8217;re in a decent position ahead of the rest of the weekend. We have a much better read on the car than we did this time last week and the aim now is to push on and execute an even better Saturday. We tried a couple of things on set-up, some worked, others not so much, but I have no real complaints at this stage and I feel we can find even more in the car in Practice tomorrow ahead of Qualifying. It&#8217;s really good to be back here in Miami at this impressive venue. Let&#8217;s see what we can do tomorrow where, of course, the minimum aim has to be reaching Q3.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Pat Fry, Chief Technical Officer</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a productive Friday for the team today here in Miami and it was good to have two smooth Practice sessions where we&#8217;ve been able to run to our programme and tick things off our list. We have another good read on the upgrades from last week, which are in line with our expectations and performing well on the car. The field looks extremely tight with a couple of tenths of a second the difference between a handful of positions, especially in and around the top ten. Everything will need to click and go right if we are to be at the upper end of that mix. As ever, we&#8217;ll run through the data, see which set-up direction works and aim to come back tomorrow with some further improvements.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05: Esteban Ocon of France and Alpine F1 prepares to drive in the garage\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05: Pierre Gasly of France driving the (10) Alpine F1 A523 Renault on track\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05: Esteban Ocon of France and Alpine F1 prepares to drive in the garage during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Miami at Miami International Autodrome on May 05, 2023 in Miami, Florida.

That was a shame for the German who had looked quick in FP1. In FP2 it was Magnussen&#8217;s turn to have a moment, the Dane spinning and just clipping the barriers with his front wing. He was fortunate to be able to continue.</p>\n<p><strong>Nico Hulkenberg - FP1: 1:31.392, P9; FP2: 1:29.393, P17</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I wanted it a bit too much, a bit too soon and paid the price for it. It happens sometimes and luckily there wasn&#8217;t too much damage and we picked things up in FP2 and were in a good spot. I feel the car actually handles and fits quite well to this circuit and I like the circuit a lot too. It was my first time on track in a Formula 1 car and it&#8217;s got a nice flow to it, it&#8217;s technical and challenging. I had a good day despite the incident.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Magnussen &#8211; FP1: 1:31.853, P13; FP2: 1:29.171, P12</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I think we had a good day. We did some tests in FP1 with the new bits we brought for this race and that&#8217;s looking good and I tried them in FP2 and it seems to be feeling good. A heavy-fuel run was looking very good as well, so it&#8217;s all going to plan and hopefully we can repeat it again tomorrow. I think Q2, maybe Q3 is possible &#8211; it&#8217;s super tight and a couple of tenths will put you from P15 to P10 &#8211; so it&#8217;s all to play for tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Guenther Steiner, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;As much as today doesn&#8217;t look good for us, it was a good day. The only little thing was Nico&#8217;s crash in FP1 but the team did a fantastic job to get him out again for FP2. Where we were in the standings doesn&#8217;t really show where we are as Nico on his fast lap had a lot of traffic in the second sector. All in all, we&#8217;re very happy and the upgrade seems to be working well so we&#8217;re really looking forward to going out again tomorrow and having a good qualifying.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"Haas F1 Team's German driver Nico Hulkenberg races during the first practice session for the 2023\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05: Kevin Magnussen of Denmark driving the (20) Haas F1 VF-23 Ferrari on track\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">Haas F1 Team's German driver Nico Hulkenberg races during the first practice session for the 2023 Miami Formula One Grand Prix at the Miami International Autodrome in Miami Gardens, Florida, on May 5, 2023.

Albon did better, he didn&#8217;t get a clean lap on the softs in FP1 but showed plenty of potential in the afternoon session.</p>\n<p><strong>Logan Sargeant - FP1: 1:32.619, P19; FP2: 1:30.038, P20</strong></p>\n<p>\"A tricky day that wasn&#8217;t the smoothest. I know what I need to do tomorrow and it&#8217;s quite clear when I look at the data. I need to keep building mainly in Sector 1. We have a little bit of setup work that we need to do to try get the consistency between high-speed and low-speed better. The driving side will come, I have no doubt about that. We just need to dial everything in, put some clean laps in during FP3, then take it that last step in Qualifying.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Alex Albon - FP1: 1:31.903, P15; FP2: 1:29.046, P10</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was a tough day; I think we definitely had the car in a better window for FP2, however it&#8217;s fair to say this track doesn&#8217;t suit us as the other circuits have in previous rounds. We&#8217;ll need to try get on top of it as much as possible, seeing what we can change tonight to improve the car. I think a lot of the problems are more car characteristics then set up, but we&#8217;ll give it a go. It&#8217;s clearly very close out there with fine margins, so it&#8217;s going to be a fight.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Dave Robson, Head of Vehicle Performance</strong></p>\n<p>\"The first Free Practice session was dominated by the new track surface and very high temperatures. This made the tyre behaviour a little tricky to predict and initially made the lap times very slow. However, the track improved quickly, which allowed the lap times to tumble, but this made testing things difficult. Nonetheless, we got through a lot of useful work in FP1.\nBy the evening Free Practice session, the track had improved further and was cooling quickly as the sun set. Despite another red flag interruption, we completed another good programme during which both drivers refined their car balance and tyre management.</p>\n<p>\"The next two days could be heavily influenced by the weather, but we did enough running today to be in a good position to adapt to whatever happens. The car is behaving quite well and with further tuning before qualifying, we should be in the usual tight midfield fight.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05:  Alexander Albon of Thailand driving the (23) Williams FW45 Mercedeson\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05: Logan Sargeant of United States driving the (2) Williams FW45 Mercedes on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05:  Alexander Albon of Thailand driving the (23) Williams FW45 Mercedeson track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Miami at Miami International Autodrome on May 05, 2023 in Miami, Florida.

Come FP2, both finally managed plenty of running, but with De Vries making up for lost time and not running a traditional programme, quite where they are in the pecking order is a mystery.</p>\n<p><strong>Nyck de Vries - FP1: 1:34.637, P20; FP2: 1:30.038, P19</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Miami is a unique event and the venue is great, so it feels awesome to be racing in front of the American crowd. It&#8217;s a new track for me and grip levels are extremely low, so you get quicker with each lap that you do. Even though the temperature is quite high, tyre warm-up seems to be a challenge because they need a long time before they perform. There is something to find in that area, so we&#8217;ll analyse this tonight and hopefully come back stronger tomorrow. Looking at our performance today, we are not where we wanted to be, but we&#8217;ll try to put all the pieces together.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Yuki Tsunoda - FP1: 1:32.169, P18; FP2: 1:29.613, P18</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a challenging day because the pace does not seem great so far, so we need to find a solution to improve. Compared to last year, our overall performance has increased and the track surface has improved, but we are still lacking quite a bit of pace compared to our competitors. We didn&#8217;t have any big upgrades coming into this race, so we&#8217;ll need to try a different approach for tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Jonathan Eddolls, Chief Race Engineer</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It hasn't been such a straightforward Friday for us today. Both drivers have been struggling with overall grip and find it hard to extract the lap times. Yuki completed a front wing comparison in FP1 with positive results, so this will be retained for the rest of the weekend. It&#8217;s not a game-changer and works better with the aero components we have coming on stream in future, but it is still adding performance with this package. This morning Nyck had a small spin in the twisty section of Turn 11 and Turn 12 and just touched the wall with the rear end of the car, but the damage was enough to have to stop the session and swap the gearbox for FP2. The mechanics did a great job to turn the car around, and having missed out on running the Soft compound in FP1, it left him with two sets for FP2. On the other side of the garage, Yuki ran on the usual Medium and Soft tyres. Again, there were no big balance limitations for either driver, but they just lacked grip, so we need to review the setup and tyre usage overnight. Due to the red flags, we didn't get good long-run data for tyre understanding, but the new tarmac here doesn't seem to be having such an impact on tyres, so the race will likely be a similar story to last year. We all have a busy night ahead of us to try to find some grip and lap time, as the performance we have shown today is falling short of our expectations.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04 on track\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05: Nyck de Vries of Netherlands driving the (21) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04 on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04 on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Miami at Miami International Autodrome on May 05, 2023 in Miami, Florida.

The new asphalt made the track quite slippery at first, but the surface improved as the sessions progressed. The car feels balanced and, in terms of performance, we feel a bit closer and a bit better than in Baku. It&#8217;s more or less where we expected to be today: of course, the objective is to make a step forward with the setup overnight and try to be as far ahead as possible in qualifying.

The track keeps changing and improving, but I am generally happier with the car so far. The feeling in the cockpit is good, but we still need to find a bit more to be in the fight tomorrow.

The new asphalt and how it would affect the cars was one of the biggest unknown factors heading into the event. As we&#8217;ve seen at previous races, the 2023 cars have shown themselves to be considerably quicker than last year&#8217;s equivalents: it&#8217;s no coincidence that today&#8217;s fastest time is a good nine-tenths faster than last year&#8217;s pole.</p>\n<p>\"So we can expect another notable step forwards tomorrow in terms of lap time compared to simulations, based on the information we have from the teams. The new asphalt is very smooth and slippery, offering little mechanical grip but at the same time good adhesion, which increasingly improved as conditions got better. On top of the increase in car performance this year, this led to some overheating on the rear tyres.</p>\n<p>\"There was also graining seen on the medium and soft, not only on the rear tyres but also on the fronts, which are heavily worked at this circuit. The hard tyres showed themselves to be very consistent. We&#8217;ll see how the track improves tomorrow, taking weather conditions into account as well. Cloudier skies are expected, with a significant possibility of rain on Sunday.\"</p>\n\n    </div>",

Verstappen complained about his headrest at times as he had done in Baku, but in FP2 looked very quick indeed and wound up on top by an eye-watering 0.385s. Perez locked up and ran wide on a couple of occasions, but from being off the pace in FP1, at least dragged himself back into contention in the second session.

Initially we were getting used to the track with the new tarmac, it was ramping up a lot throughout the day. It\u2019s still quite slippery off line but on the driving line it\u2019s okay. Most importantly today we had good balance in the car so I feel happy. There are still a few things we want to look at overnight, ideally we want to be faster on every corner, which isn\u2019t always possible.

Getting a read in these low grip conditions is tricky but there are only very small margins to ensure we make improvements. We have been trying some stuff with the mechanical balance and I think we learnt quite a bit. I haven\u2019t had the greatest of Fridays. On one of my flying laps I locked up on the final corner and then on the long run I don\u2019t think we managed to get too much of a read on the laps we got in. So, I still have quite a bit to come, together with my driving because I was not driving very well today. If I am able to improve my driving and get myself a bit more comfortable, I should be alright.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05: Max Verstappen of the Netherlands driving the (1) Oracle Red Bull Racing RB19 on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Miami at Miami International Autodrome on May 05, 2023 in Miami, Florida.

The team opted to send their drivers out in the last moments for their quick laps, and they wound up with a 1-2 thanks to running when the track was at its best.

We weren\u2019t particularly quick, and it was a struggle out there. The grip is quite low on this new surface. It is slippery, particularly for the rear-end. The track temperature today was very high so there was lots of sliding. \"FP1 looked quite good but our pace in FP2 was a kick in the guts. We\u2019re trying lots of different things and we\u2019ll keep working on it. We\u2019ll regroup tonight, see if we can make some set-up changes and get the car in a better sweet spot. It\u2019s a great weekend here and a great place to be so there are still positives.\" George Russell - FP1: 1:30.125, P1; FP2: 1:29.216, P15 \"Today didn\u2019t feel too dissimilar to last year here in Miami. In 2022, we were fastest on Friday but then knocked out in Q2 on Saturday. This year, the car changed even during the session. FP1 was a bit of a messy hour but we ended fastest. In FP2, I felt strong on the medium run but when we put the soft tyre on, the car wasn\u2019t working for me. We understand a little bit why that is and fortunately, we\u2019ve got the time to make improvements overnight. It\u2019s fine margins out there. \"I think going into Sunday there will be a few unknowns. The track has been resurfaced this year but it\u2019s still not performing like another circuit. It\u2019s a true outlier. I think that\u2019s cool in some regards, but it could be difficult to race on. You can\u2019t afford to drive offline as you lose all grip. \"Looking at Saturday, if everything is right then there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t be ahead of Ferrari and Aston Martin. As we\u2019ve seen at the first four races, it\u2019s very tight between all three teams. If we maximise everything, we can be rewarded and jump ahead of them. We know we\u2019ve got the potential, but we need to improve overnight.\" Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director \"Our programme in FP1 was offset compared to others, so the headline times flattered us to some degree. Nevertheless, we clearly had the car in a nice window and both drivers found that the lap time came quite easily. We made some subtle changes to the car before FP2, but it immediately become apparent that in cooler conditions the car was more of handful on new tyres. The red flag for Leclerc\u2019s crash meanwhile meant that everyone was limited to only a few laps on high fuel. From the running we did get, our pace in that aspect looks OK. It\u2019s going to be difficult to overtake here though so we must improve our single lap balance this evening, otherwise we will face a frustrating Sunday. As usual, we have the support of our factory overnight and we\u2019ve got a good read on the issues from today, so we know what to work on.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W14 on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Miami at Miami International Autodrome on May 05, 2023 in Miami, Florida.

We know it will be incredibly hot here \u2013 probably the hottest track temperatures of the year \u2013 so tyre degradation will be a big factor and something we need to monitor across the weekend.

It\u2019s not been a bad day, but we\u2019ve got plenty to look over for tomorrow.\u201d Andrea Stella, Team Principal \u201cToday was a productive day. We worked through our programme of understanding the new surface of this track, and the behaviour of the tyres, both over a single lap and longer runs. We also did some useful work on set-up. Overall, we seem to be able to compete for Q3 and for points, but once again we can see the midfield is very compact.

For us, it was a smooth day on track overall and it was good to have two full sessions to work on the set-up of the car. Today was a day of data gathering, and really looking into how the track and surface feel, and how the tyres behave. I have to say the organisers did a great job as the tarmac is much better than last year. We still have one more Practice session and some work to do to fine-tune our car before Qualifying. I am definitely looking forward to seeing what we can do and hopefully we can be in the mix for a strong result.\u201d Pierre Gasly - FP1: 1:31.104, P6; FP2: 1:29.098, P11 \u201cIt was important for us to have a clean and uneventful day in the car and I think we\u2019re in a decent position ahead of the rest of the weekend. We have a much better read on the car than we did this time last week and the aim now is to push on and execute an even better Saturday. We tried a couple of things on set-up, some worked, others not so much, but I have no real complaints at this stage and I feel we can find even more in the car in Practice tomorrow ahead of Qualifying. It\u2019s really good to be back here in Miami at this impressive venue. Let\u2019s see what we can do tomorrow where, of course, the minimum aim has to be reaching Q3.\u201d Pat Fry, Chief Technical Officer \u201cIt\u2019s been a productive Friday for the team today here in Miami and it was good to have two smooth Practice sessions where we\u2019ve been able to run to our programme and tick things off our list. We have another good read on the upgrades from last week, which are in line with our expectations and performing well on the car. The field looks extremely tight with a couple of tenths of a second the difference between a handful of positions, especially in and around the top ten. Everything will need to click and go right if we are to be at the upper end of that mix. As ever, we\u2019ll run through the data, see which set-up direction works and aim to come back tomorrow with some further improvements.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05: Esteban Ocon of France and Alpine F1 prepares to drive in the garage during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Miami at Miami International Autodrome on May 05, 2023 in Miami, Florida.

That was a shame for the German who had looked quick in FP1. In FP2 it was Magnussen\u2019s turn to have a moment, the Dane spinning and just clipping the barriers with his front wing. He was fortunate to be able to continue. Nico Hulkenberg - FP1: 1:31.392, P9; FP2: 1:29.393, P17 \u201cI wanted it a bit too much, a bit too soon and paid the price for it. It happens sometimes and luckily there wasn\u2019t too much damage and we picked things up in FP2 and were in a good spot. I feel the car actually handles and fits quite well to this circuit and I like the circuit a lot too. It was my first time on track in a Formula 1 car and it\u2019s got a nice flow to it, it\u2019s technical and challenging. I had a good day despite the incident.\u201d Kevin Magnussen \u2013 FP1: 1:31.853, P13; FP2: 1:29.171, P12 \u201cI think we had a good day. We did some tests in FP1 with the new bits we brought for this race and that\u2019s looking good and I tried them in FP2 and it seems to be feeling good. A heavy-fuel run was looking very good as well, so it\u2019s all going to plan and hopefully we can repeat it again tomorrow. I think Q2, maybe Q3 is possible \u2013 it\u2019s super tight and a couple of tenths will put you from P15 to P10 \u2013 so it\u2019s all to play for tomorrow.\u201d Guenther Steiner, Team Principal \u201cAs much as today doesn\u2019t look good for us, it was a good day. The only little thing was Nico\u2019s crash in FP1 but the team did a fantastic job to get him out again for FP2. Where we were in the standings doesn\u2019t really show where we are as Nico on his fast lap had a lot of traffic in the second sector. All in all, we\u2019re very happy and the upgrade seems to be working well so we\u2019re really looking forward to going out again tomorrow and having a good qualifying.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 Haas F1 Team's German driver Nico Hulkenberg races during the first practice session for the 2023 Miami Formula One Grand Prix at the Miami International Autodrome in Miami Gardens, Florida, on May 5, 2023.

Albon did better, he didn\u2019t get a clean lap on the softs in FP1 but showed plenty of potential in the afternoon session. Logan Sargeant - FP1: 1:32.619, P19; FP2: 1:30.038, P20 \"A tricky day that wasn\u2019t the smoothest. I know what I need to do tomorrow and it\u2019s quite clear when I look at the data. I need to keep building mainly in Sector 1. We have a little bit of setup work that we need to do to try get the consistency between high-speed and low-speed better. The driving side will come, I have no doubt about that. We just need to dial everything in, put some clean laps in during FP3, then take it that last step in Qualifying.\" Alex Albon - FP1: 1:31.903, P15; FP2: 1:29.046, P10 \"It was a tough day; I think we definitely had the car in a better window for FP2, however it\u2019s fair to say this track doesn\u2019t suit us as the other circuits have in previous rounds. We\u2019ll need to try get on top of it as much as possible, seeing what we can change tonight to improve the car. I think a lot of the problems are more car characteristics then set up, but we\u2019ll give it a go. It\u2019s clearly very close out there with fine margins, so it\u2019s going to be a fight.\" Dave Robson, Head of Vehicle Performance \"The first Free Practice session was dominated by the new track surface and very high temperatures. This made the tyre behaviour a little tricky to predict and initially made the lap times very slow. However, the track improved quickly, which allowed the lap times to tumble, but this made testing things difficult. Nonetheless, we got through a lot of useful work in FP1. By the evening Free Practice session, the track had improved further and was cooling quickly as the sun set. Despite another red flag interruption, we completed another good programme during which both drivers refined their car balance and tyre management. \"The next two days could be heavily influenced by the weather, but we did enough running today to be in a good position to adapt to whatever happens. The car is behaving quite well and with further tuning before qualifying, we should be in the usual tight midfield fight.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05: Alexander Albon of Thailand driving the (23) Williams FW45 Mercedeson track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Miami at Miami International Autodrome on May 05, 2023 in Miami, Florida.

If Tsunoda\u2019s hour was anything to go by, all he missed was plenty of traffic \u2013 the Japanese racer left furious on several occasions at being baulked. Come FP2, both finally managed plenty of running, but with De Vries making up for lost time and not running a traditional programme, quite where they are in the pecking order is a mystery. Nyck de Vries - FP1: 1:34.637, P20; FP2: 1:30.038, P19 \u201cMiami is a unique event and the venue is great, so it feels awesome to be racing in front of the American crowd. It\u2019s a new track for me and grip levels are extremely low, so you get quicker with each lap that you do. Even though the temperature is quite high, tyre warm-up seems to be a challenge because they need a long time before they perform. There is something to find in that area, so we\u2019ll analyse this tonight and hopefully come back stronger tomorrow. Looking at our performance today, we are not where we wanted to be, but we\u2019ll try to put all the pieces together.\u201d Yuki Tsunoda - FP1: 1:32.169, P18; FP2: 1:29.613, P18 \u201cIt was a challenging day because the pace does not seem great so far, so we need to find a solution to improve. Compared to last year, our overall performance has increased and the track surface has improved, but we are still lacking quite a bit of pace compared to our competitors. We didn\u2019t have any big upgrades coming into this race, so we\u2019ll need to try a different approach for tomorrow.\u201d Jonathan Eddolls, Chief Race Engineer \u201cIt hasn't been such a straightforward Friday for us today. Both drivers have been struggling with overall grip and find it hard to extract the lap times. Yuki completed a front wing comparison in FP1 with positive results, so this will be retained for the rest of the weekend. It\u2019s not a game-changer and works better with the aero components we have coming on stream in future, but it is still adding performance with this package. This morning Nyck had a small spin in the twisty section of Turn 11 and Turn 12 and just touched the wall with the rear end of the car, but the damage was enough to have to stop the session and swap the gearbox for FP2. The mechanics did a great job to turn the car around, and having missed out on running the Soft compound in FP1, it left him with two sets for FP2. On the other side of the garage, Yuki ran on the usual Medium and Soft tyres. Again, there were no big balance limitations for either driver, but they just lacked grip, so we need to review the setup and tyre usage overnight. Due to the red flags, we didn't get good long-run data for tyre understanding, but the new tarmac here doesn't seem to be having such an impact on tyres, so the race will likely be a similar story to last year. We all have a busy night ahead of us to try to find some grip and lap time, as the performance we have shown today is falling short of our expectations.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04 on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Miami at Miami International Autodrome on May 05, 2023 in Miami, Florida.

They did manage to get plenty of laps in with no obvious issues, but on current form, don\u2019t look likely to challenge for the front of the midfield. Valtteri Bottas - FP1: 1:31.902, P14; FP2: 1:29.189, P14 \u201cIt was important to get as much time as possible on track today and, despite the red flags, we managed to have a productive session. The new asphalt made the track quite slippery at first, but the surface improved as the sessions progressed. The car feels balanced and, in terms of performance, we feel a bit closer and a bit better than in Baku. It\u2019s more or less where we expected to be today: of course, the objective is to make a step forward with the setup overnight and try to be as far ahead as possible in qualifying. The field is really close so there\u2019s all to fight for.\u201d Zhou Guanyu - FP1: 1:32.134, P17; FP2: 1:29.181, P13 \u201cA good day on track for me \u2013 I feel we made a step forward between the two sessions today. The track keeps changing and improving, but I am generally happier with the car so far. The feeling in the cockpit is good, but we still need to find a bit more to be in the fight tomorrow. Compared to last week, however, we are in a better place and we must build on this ahead of qualifying.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 05: Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Miami at Miami International Autodrome on May 05, 2023 in Miami, Florida.

Verstappen was struggling by contract with the balance of his RB19 and in the end had to settle for second.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.i-learned-a-lot-of-things-verstappen-takes-the-positives-from-baku-despite.6Xq6FIGKhBT6ovoFYXccWO.html\">READ MORE: &#8216;I learned a lot of things&#8217; &#8211; Verstappen takes the positives from Baku despite losing out to team mate Perez</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Max Verstappen, 2nd</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Overall it was quite a good race. Of course, I was a bit unlucky with the safety car call, but I think in that second stint both of us were pushing flat out. We used every centimetre on that track and touched a few walls! It was a good Team result and there were a lot of learnings from this weekend to take forward to the rest of the season. We bought it home and a 1-2 for the Team was ideal, Checo had a great race and did very well today. I&#8217;m already looking forward to Miami and seeing what we can do there.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Sergio Perez, 1st</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It has been an unbelievable weekend, I am super pleased and I cannot say more about the Team, it has been a tremendous day for us and I am so proud of everyone. I want to say a big thanks to Thibaut, he is one of my mechanics who is at home for personal reasons, but he is still a very big part of our Team. The Team enjoy calling me the King of the Streets, I am super happy for them all. They have been tremendous all weekend, from the sprint race yesterday through to the way we executed the race today, it was perfect. I think today we were the fastest car on track and regardless of the safety car we would have won the race. I am definitely in the fight for the title, not just because of Baku, I believe I can be very good anywhere this season and now I am just thinking of Miami. There are a lot of races coming up and we must make sure we are on it.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Christian Horner, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Checo absolutely excelled today. He had the pace and really controlled the race, he benefitted from the timing of the safety car but it was a phenomenal performance from him today and all weekend. Hats off to him. We were unlucky with the safety car and the pit stop for Max. Sometimes things like that don&#8217;t go your way but that is racing and we will learn from it. Other than that it was an excellent performance from the whole team, another 1-2, our 25th! Things are clicking for us at the moment and it sets us up well for next week but it is still early days, there are 19 races and 5 more sprint races in this long season. With each race comes moments to savour but just as many learnings, we take those and move to the next challenge, preparation for Miami is already well under way, see you at the beach!&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Race winner Sergio Perez of Mexico and Oracle Red Bull Racing\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Race winner Sergio Perez of Mexico and Oracle Red Bull Racing\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Race winner Sergio Perez of Mexico and Oracle Red Bull Racing and\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">3</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Race winner Sergio Perez of Mexico and Oracle Red Bull Racing celebrates with teammates in parc ferme during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

From there, he had a lonely race in third but at least scored his first podium of the season. Sainz lost out to Alonso after the Safety Car peeled in, and came close to losing a place to Hamilton but in the end managed his tyres well enough to have enough rubber left to defend hard in the closing stages.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.leclerc-says-ferrari-absolutely-maximised-azerbaijan-weekend-after-claiming.3cebi7civvRc2WY0d8vKmm.html\">READ MORE: Leclerc says Ferrari 'absolutely maximised' Azerbaijan weekend after claiming first podium of season</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Charles Leclerc, 3rd</strong></p>\n<p>\"We are still not quite there in terms of race pace and we know that&#8217;s what we have to work on the most at the moment. We maximised every session throughout the weekend and couldn't have done anything differently, so that&#8217;s something to be happy about and the team did a great job. The bottom line is that we have to focus on race pace and tyre management and push to make even more progress in the coming races.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Carlos Sainz, 5th</strong></p>\n<p>\"This has been a very difficult weekend. P5 brings home some points but I must put my hand up and admit I lacked confidence under braking and the pace was not there. On the Medium tyre I could push a bit more, but with the harder compound I simply didn&#8217;t feel the car. Now I look forward to a reset, as Miami is just around the corner and I can&#8217;t wait to jump in the car again and keep pushing.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Fred Vasseur, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>\"Overall, this has been a positive weekend for the team. We took two pole positions and one podium finish with Charles and our overall points total, thanks also to Carlos&#8217; fifth place, is satisfactory. There were signs of progress in Melbourne, but they were overshadowed by the poor race result. In the four week break, we worked hard in Maranello and here in Baku we have made further progress which translated into a good result.</p>\n<p>\"We definitely are back to where we wanted to be in terms of qualifying, but there&#8217;s still a significant gap to Red Bull in the race. However, we aim to fight them for the win and we are gearing up to do just that. It&#8217;s a morale booster for the whole team to finish on the podium, something which we will carry forward as we prepare for next weekend&#8217;s race in Miami.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Third placed Charles Leclerc of Monaco and Ferrari celebrates on the\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Carlos Sainz of Spain and Ferrari looks on on the grid prior to the F1\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Third placed Charles Leclerc of Monaco and Ferrari celebrates on the podium during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

He was finding the afternoon&#8217;s running easy enough to spend much of the day chatting to his engineer about his set up, and suggesting improvements that could be utilised by his team mate behind. Speaking of, things seem pretty harmonious at Aston Martin with Stroll saying he wouldn&#8217;t attack when the duo were running line astern, while Alonso said he was perfectly happy if he tried a move.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.ferrari-were-quite-lucky-declares-alonso-as-he-narrowly-misses-out-on-podium.PluG4Ec5n7wQ3Cr9uH5Cq.html\">READ MORE: 'Ferrari were quite lucky' declares Alonso as he narrowly misses out on podium finish at Azerbaijan GP</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Fernando Alonso, 4th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I think we had a tricky weekend with the DRS issue on Friday and Saturday, but despite this we have finished only one second away from the podium at the chequered flag. With that in mind, I have to be happy with fourth position and our overall performance which was encouraging all race. Thankfully today the DRS seemed to work fine, and our tyre management was strong. I thought the tailwind was quite random and here in Baku you are always on the edge. We only have to wait a few days before we go racing again, so let&#8217;s see what we can do next week in Miami!&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Lance Stroll, 7th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was pretty tough out there today. I was happy with my start, as well as the Safety Car restart, but I wasn&#8217;t feeling super comfortable with the car once the race got going and made a slight mistake. A little misjudgement can end your day here, so I was fortunate to get away with brushing the wall and managed to continue with the race. Once Lewis [Hamilton] passed me, it was just about maintaining position and holding off George [Russell] for the remaining laps. He was pushing hard, but we managed the tyres well and I was able to keep him behind me. As a team, we definitely have a few things to work though ahead of Miami, but I think we need to be pleased to come away from the first Sprint weekend of the year with a decent haul of points to maintain second in the Constructors&#8217; Championship.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Mike Krack, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Another well-executed weekend by the entire team and we leave Baku with a combined total of 22 points. That is a good return from quite a challenging event on a very demanding street circuit. Full credit to the drivers who did an excellent job to make progress from their starting positions. They managed the Hard tyres well over a long stint, while maintaining good race pace, and brought the cars home safely to round off a clean weekend. This sets us up nicely for our first trip of the year to the United States next week as we get ready to entertain the fans in Miami.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Lance Stroll of Canada and Aston Martin F1 Team, Logan Sargeant of\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W14 leads Fernando Alonso of Spain driving the (14) Aston Martin AMR23 Mercedes on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

As such his team mate actually jumped him, but Russell had a poor restart and was helpless to fight off his team mate on track as Hamilton streamed past. From there, Hamilton also picked off Stroll but ran out of time to make it past Sainz, while Russell was left with a free pit stop late on which he used to grab the bonus point for fastest lap.</p>\n<p><strong>Lewis Hamilton, 6th</strong></p>\n<p>\"The timing of the Safety Car wasn't ideal! I couldn't get bogged down in that frustration though. I had to keep my head down and get focused on attacking. That's what I did, and I got right back in the race. I really enjoyed those battles with the cars around me. The Ferrari of Sainz was just a little bit quicker on the straight than us, even with the DRS open. I gave it everything I had to get past though.</p>\n<p>\"I'm continuously proud of my team. We didn't have the pace that we did in Melbourne, which is not the greatest, but there is no lack of motivation in this team. We're all super hungry, and hopefully this is the beginning of something better in the coming races. Once I get that confidence in the car, the pace will come.\"</p>\n<p><strong>George Russell, 8th</strong></p>\n<p>\"I'm a little bit disappointed with myself today. I made a really good start and got in a decent position. I made a good move on Stroll to get past him into the pit lane but I then made a mess of the restart. I was defending from Lance and almost ran into the back of Fernando (Alonso). I then ran wide and got my tyres dirty. Ultimately that's why both Lance and Lewis got past. From there, it was line astern.</p>\n<p>\"I'll take the extra point for fastest lap but the only reason we had that opportunity was because we were in a bad position. It was close pace-wise between ourselves, Ferrari and Aston Martin and small differences can make a big change in terms of results. Whether we finish P4 or P8 though, it's far from first so we've got a lot of work to do.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport</strong></p>\n<p>\"Today was not a thriller. There was very little overtaking even with a big pace difference. We headed into a sub optimum set-up direction during FP1 and by the time we realised it was too late, and the car was in parc ferm&#233; conditions. It's the same for everyone though under this format.</p>\n<p>\"The pace in free air today looked similar between ourselves, the Ferraris and the Aston Martins. It was hard to tell who was ultimately quicker though, because with the difficulty of overtaking you are stuck where you are stuck. The Red Bulls meanwhile sailed away into the sunset on merit. If we can get the platform right though, I think we can close that gap this year. It's not about adding points of downforce, more giving the drivers a car that they have confidence in.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director</strong></p>\n<p>\"We're never going to get excited about sixth and eighth place, but it was a day where the car wasn't particularly quick and neither driver had much luck during the race. Lewis had a decent opening lap; he'd started to get a bit of pressure from Alonso towards the end of the stint, so we came in to protect the position. Unfortunately, that was the lap before the Safety Car, so he lost out. A good restart helped the recovery, but he just couldn't get past Sainz.</p>\n<p>\"George had a really good opening lap, getting through some key cars early on. He was able to take the stop under the Safety Car but then struggled on the restart and lost a couple of places. Similarly to Lewis, he just couldn't make a pass despite having a bit more pace so our only consolation was a point for fastest lap at the end. We haven't got long to wait before we are bringing some more performance to the car and in the meantime, we just need to focus on collecting as many points as possible. We're hoping the car will be a bit better suited to the track in Miami and looking forward to being able to get back on track in just a few days.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: George Russell of Great Britain driving the (63) Mercedes AMG Petronas\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W14 comes in for a pitstop during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

I then got stuck behind Hulkenberg, but we got a couple of points on the board, which is a solid result, plus we got some good things out of the new parts we bought to track. So, I&#8217;m happy with that and we&#8217;ll try to improve again in Miami.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Oscar Piastri, 11th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a shame to miss out on points by one spot, but we were just lacking a bit of pace in the middle of the race, so there wasn&#8217;t really much more we could do. I&#8217;m happy I survived the weekend after being unwell and we&#8217;ve got some really good learning in the bank. I certainly learned a lot about the tyres in that race, and how to manage them better, so all of that will help us fight for points next time. Thanks to the team here and back at the factory for getting the upgrades out to us, it's definitely helped. We go again in Miami.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Andrea Stella, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;An interesting weekend in Azerbaijan with the new Sprint format. Our main objective for the weekend remained preparing for the race: this was where the most points were available. The top four teams are a little bit ahead at the moment, so the mission was to be at the head of the midfield. We achieved that thanks to the upgrades we fitted this weekend. Thanks go to the team back at the factory and at track for helping us bring these parts to the car. Over the next few races, we will be able to verify how much of that is a genuine improvement, and how much was track-specific.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Lando, once again, was rock solid. Another clean weekend brings us a couple of very useful points. We were highly impressed with Oscar too. He&#8217;s been unwell this weekend but managed to focus on the job, also delivering a clean weekend with no mistakes. Thank you to our excellent medical staff for their continuous support throughout the weekend. We hope he&#8217;ll be feeling better in a few days when we start again in Miami.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Lando Norris of Great Britain driving the (4) McLaren MCL60 Mercedes\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Oscar Piastri of Australia driving the (81) McLaren MCL60 Mercedes on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Lando Norris of Great Britain driving the (4) McLaren MCL60 Mercedes on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

That moment brought out the Safety Car that proved to be so pivotal. As for Tsunoda, he dropped out of the top 10 at the start after getting baulked on the first lap, but played the long game and overtook Hulkenberg late on to get back into the points, holding Piastri at bay for his second P10 finish in a row.</p>\n<p><strong>Nyck de Vries, DNF</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;The accident today was fully my mistake. It was very silly and unnecessary and that responsibility is on me. I am disappointed with myself but that&#8217;s the way it is. There are positives to take away from this weekend and I&#8217;ll try to look at them. I am happy to be racing again next week so I forget this weekend as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Yuki Tsunoda, 10th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a tough race today but the team, especially the mechanics, did a great job to repair the car after yesterday. The engineers found a strong set-up, even if we lost some time in sector two. We didn&#8217;t get many chances to do long runs this weekend but to be able to demonstrate a strong pace, and build on this performance throughout the race, was awesome from the team. I am also happy with my performance. I was consistent, and being sandwiched between the two McLarens meant any mistake would cost us the point. It took a lot of concentration but in the end, we were able to achieve another top-ten finish. There is still room for development and improvement to fight for points consistently, but I have confidence in my team to race stronger in the future.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Franz Tost, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Firstly, congratulations to Red Bull Racing for another front-row finish. As for our weekend, we came to this race with some aero updates, and I&#8217;m pleased to say they seem to work very well. The team in Bicester did a fantastic job because we have been competitive from the very beginning of the weekend. The highlight was of course Friday&#8217;s qualifying, where Yuki finished in eighth position. As for today&#8217;s race, he was overtaken by Stroll and Russell on the first lap, but this is what I expected as their cars are simply faster than ours. Nevertheless, Yuki did a fantastic job. He was able to split the McLarens, staying quite close to Norris and keeping Piastri behind. Overall, a big congratulations to Yuki for another strong performance, which shows how much he is improving race by race. Unfortunately, Nyck had an accident, he touched the wall in turn 5, breaking the front left track rod, and that was the end of his race. Generally speaking, we have improved the car performance dramatically since the start of the season, so now I am even more looking forward to the next race in Miami.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Guillaume Dezoteux, Head of Vehicle Performance</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We are very happy to end the weekend with a point. Yuki drove a solid race, the strategy calls were right and the pit stop was competitive. At the start of the race, we knew it would be difficult to hold faster cars behind us, but Yuki remained focused, made no mistakes and settled in a train of cars with both McLarens, a Haas and an Alpine. We were continuously evaluating safety car scenarios and monitoring other cars to react, although in the end, there was nothing to react to. Nyck's race started well with an offset strategy. We decided to start on the hard tyre, chasing any opportunity to make ground through the pack. Unfortunately, he made contact with the inside of Turn 5 and broke his front left track rod, which forced him to stop on track. Overall, this weekend has been solid and the track layout has suited us better. There are similarities in Miami, so we will review everything in the next couple of days to prepare as best we can for next weekend.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04 on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: The car of Nyck de Vries of Netherlands and Scuderia AlphaTauri is\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04 on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

His car was okay to continue, but he spent most of the race stuck in a DRS train and unable to make progress. The same could be said for Sargeant, who pitted under the Safety Car but didn&#8217;t have the pace to really fight those around him. Better races to come from Williams, who need to find a way to convert their one-lap pace into race advantage.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.highlights-watch-as-sergio-perez-wins-the-2023-azerbaijan-grand-prix.4v3cZ8DYa87X8r18wvbon2.html\">HIGHLIGHTS: Watch as Sergio Perez wins the 2023 Azerbaijan Grand Prix</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Logan Sargeant, 16th</strong></p>\n<p>\"All things considered I learned a lot this weekend. In the race today, we got a bit unlucky with the safety car timing at the start and fell into a bit of a lonely, frustrating race. I was stuck behind Zhou for most of it. By the time he pitted it was just too late and I was too far disconnected from the pack ahead. However, when I did get in front, the car felt good, I was driving well, and the pace was not too bad at the end. I brought a set of hard tyres a long way and that&#8217;s all positive.</p>\n<p>\"Our one lap pace this weekend was good, and I was happy considering we only had one free practice session to go into qualifying and have a pretty good one. It was going to be an even better Sprint Shootout until the crash, so I&#8217;ll learn from that and move forward. The race wasn&#8217;t bad, it just fell out of our hands and was a lonely, boring one for most people.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Alex Albon, 12th</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was really tough out there today. I had some damage on my front wing for most of the race following contact with the McLaren, so there was a lot of management to do. It was tricky trying to keep the Haas behind me whilst staying close to Oscar, and not a lot of room for overtaking with the shortened DRS zones. We really did maximise this weekend and I think it was personally one of my strongest, especially coming off Australia. I think we definitely have more to find with the car, but I think I&#8217;m becoming at one with it, so hopefully we can keep this going.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Dave Robson, Head of Vehicle Performance</strong></p>\n<p>\"Alex suffered some front wing damage on the opening lap, which hurt the car balance and cost him downforce. Despite this he was able to put together another very strong race; he dealt with the pressure from Gasly and Magnussen brilliantly whilst also staying close to Piastri ahead. The timing of the early safety car was unfortunate for our strategy, but that is the nature of racing at Baku.</p>\n<p>Having missed the sprint race yesterday, Logan started the Grand Prix somewhat on the back foot but still put together a strong drive to fight with Zhou and Gasly. His pace and car management were competitive and gave him some very valuable learning for the future.</p>\n<p>\"We arrived in Baku for this new style sprint event expecting it to be a challenge. Although we rose to that challenge well and were able to put together a strong performance overall, it is frustrating not to get some points for our effort. Nonetheless, we head to Miami with some positive momentum and another good opportunity to challenge the top 10.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Alexander Albon of Thailand driving the (23) Williams FW45 Mercedes\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">1</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Alexander Albon of Thailand driving the (23) Williams FW45 Mercedes leads Pierre Gasly of France driving the (10) Alpine F1 A523 Renault on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

He tried hard from there on in, but wasn&#8217;t able to climb back into the points. Hulkenberg had started from the pit lane and went for a very long first stint in the hopes a late Safety Car would offer him a free pit stop, but his tyres went off the cliff and he dropped back through the field.</p>\n<p><strong>Nico Hulkenberg, 17th</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was hard work &#8211; I was head-down, focused. It was a quali race to be honest for me, that was all I had but it was okay for 40 laps or so and then at the end, unfortunately the tyres started to drop quite rapidly. The Safety Car didn&#8217;t come out and that&#8217;s what we needed with the strategy we pursued. Nevertheless, it was good learning. We elected for a pit lane start and changed the set up completely to something more conventional. We learned something, on the positive side, and now onto Miami where I think we&#8217;ll be more competitive.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Magnussen, 13th</strong></p>\n<p>\"We were stuck in traffic the whole race, we had pace for much more but just couldn&#8217;t pass. Unfortunately, with the wing we have it&#8217;s really fast with no DRS but with DRS it doesn&#8217;t really have a big impact. Overtaking is very difficult, defending is pretty good because without DRS we&#8217;re pretty fast. That little detail made the difference today because I think looking at the cars ahead I was way quicker than them but just couldn&#8217;t get past. A bit of the same story as last year as we were in the points until the end but this year, we had even more pace. Hopefully that carries onto Miami, and we will try again.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Guenther Steiner, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>\"Kevin got his front wing endplate knocked off at the start because Bottas in front of him locked up, so he couldn&#8217;t avoid him, and it was severe enough to make a front wing change. With Nico, we tried a different strategy and it didn&#8217;t work because the Safety Car came too early. All in all, the performance of the car was good and we could hold pace with the Alpine and McLaren. I think we just have to take this one as a little dip and come back in Miami, where maybe for our car it&#8217;s even better, being a medium-downforce circuit.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Kevin Magnussen of Denmark and Haas F1 looks on on the grid prior to\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Nico Hulkenberg of Germany driving the (27) Haas F1 VF-23 Ferrari on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Kevin Magnussen of Denmark and Haas F1 looks on on the grid prior to the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

Gasly pitted very early to get onto the hard compound, but as such lost out when the Safety Car came out. He pitted again, one of the few to try a two-stop strategy which wasn&#8217;t the quickest way to the flag. As for Ocon, he climbed into the top 10 after starting in the pit lane on the hard tyres, and pitted on the very last lap as he desperately tried to hang on for a second Safety Car, which never came.</p>\n<p><strong>Esteban Ocon, 15th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We gave it everything we could today, going for the Hail Mary strategy in the hope for a late Safety Car or incident, but things did not go our way. We can be proud with our efforts, pushing all the way to the end and extracting the most from the Hard tyres. I had a bit of a scary moment at the end of the race when I came into pit and saw people congregating in the Pit Lane even though the race had not ended. Fortunately, nothing happened, but we must make sure these scenarios don&#8217;t happen again. We were not where we want to be in terms of performance this weekend. And, after a weekend of learning, we have a chance to review and comeback stronger in Miami. I know we will do just that.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Pierre Gasly, 14th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a weekend all of us are keen to quickly move on from as it&#8217;s been a very frustrating one for all of us at the team. We have to make sure this kind of performance is not repeated again. Clearly, it is not where we should be and we need to come back stronger for Miami next week on a more conventional track. In terms of my race, we tried something different on strategy and hoped for some fortune, but in the end, we couldn&#8217;t do much more. I made a couple of moves, that&#8217;s always satisfying, but it&#8217;s much more rewarding when those overtakes are for points. I&#8217;m looking forward to racing in Miami next weekend.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Otmar Szafnauer, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a bitterly disappointing weekend for the team in Baku and we must not repeat this type of performance again. We very much started on the backfoot on Friday and since then we were not able to make any kind of recovery in any of the sessions. We were quite far off on car set-up on Friday during practice and with such limited running &#8211; notably with some reliability issues on both cars &#8211; we left ourselves with a mountain to climb for the remainder of the weekend. We must limit these problems going forward and begin all Grand Prix weekends on the front-foot to make sure we give ourselves the best possible chance on Saturday and Sunday to score points. We demonstrated our race pace in Australia and we have a better chance to validate our upgrade package in Miami.

Bottas collided with Magnussen at the start which dropped him back through the field, and from there struggled more than most with tyre wear. He pitted three times in the end on his way to last place. At least he saw the chequered flag though &#8211; Zhou was called in to the pits midway through to retire the car with technical issues.</p>\n<p><strong>Valtteri Bottas, 18th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t a great race for us and we were never in the mix for the points: we need to understand what happened and, most importantly, how to get back to being competitive. My race was hard from the start: I had a contact in turn two, I was on the outside and I was hit from the left and from behind, which left me with some damage. It was quite a long race after that: we tried to find a way back in, as anything can happen here, but eventually there weren&#8217;t any chances for us to rebuild our race. For sure, we need to improve our pace and do everything we can to move forward. We head straight to Miami now: it is a very different track from this, we will stay motivated and go for it again.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Zhou Guanyu, DNF</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Quite the weekend to forget for us: it&#8217;s never nice to DNF, but realistically we didn&#8217;t have a chance to score points today. We needed to retire the car as a precaution as we had rising temperatures and alarms on my dash. In general, it was a tough weekend for all of us. We need to understand the reasons for this and work hard, all of us, to make a step forward. I am confident this team can do that, I see it in the people here and at home. We will do all in our power to get back where we expect to be and continue to improve.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Alessandro Alunni Bravi, Team Representative</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;This was a disappointing race and it showed that, right now, our package is not competitive enough to score points. The priority for everyone of us in the team &#8211; here at the track and back at base &#8211; is to work hard and make the improvements necessary to get back where we expect to be. The field remains tight, and we can get back into this battle: but we must deliver a step forward to do so. We are all fully committed to this and we&#8217;re going to do whatever it takes to get there.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Zhou Guanyu of China and Alfa Romeo F1 talks with Valtteri Bottas of\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari comes in for a pitstop during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

As we fully expected, nearly all the drivers chose an opening stint on the P Zero Yellow medium before moving onto the P Zero White hard: only the drivers who started from the pit lane &#8211; Alpine&#8217;s Esteban Ocon and Haas driver Nico Hulkenberg &#8211; or those at the back of the grid like AlphaTauri&#8217;s Nyck De Vries, chose to start with a long stint on the hard tyre before going onto soft in the hope of a safety car during the closing stages. With very little long run data to fall back on, which was mainly collected during yesterday&#8217;s Sprint, there were a few more unknowns than usual heading into today&#8217;s grand prix. We&#8217;re pleased that the hard tyre not only showed a good level of reliability, with some runs of 300 kilometres on it, but that it also allowed drivers to push as hard as they liked. Proof of this came from the spectacular exchange of fastest laps among the top four, all from different teams, which additionally underlines the versatility of this compound. The fact that the best time among them (1m44.232s from Verstappen) was 1.8 seconds faster than last year&#8217;s fastest race lap is significant. The medium, which everyone had a bit more information on compared to the hard, showed performance in line with expectations but suffered from less graining, probably thanks also to the extra grip offered by the new asphalt.\"</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.facts-and-stats-red-bull-take-25th-one-two-as-perez-makes-it-five-street.1NNXwQKTk3DIIxlvsQrg4Q.html\">FACTS AND STATS: Red Bull take 25th one-two as Perez makes it five street wins in a row</a></strong></p>\n\n    </div>",

But with de Vries in the wall, the team opted to pit Verstappen. A lap later when the Safety Car came out, Perez was able to dive in and leapfrog his team mate. While the Mexican got lucky, from there he drove a superb race at a track he so often goes well at, and never seemed under undue pressure. Verstappen was struggling by contract with the balance of his RB19 and in the end had to settle for second.

Of course, I was a bit unlucky with the safety car call, but I think in that second stint both of us were pushing flat out. We used every centimetre on that track and touched a few walls! It was a good Team result and there were a lot of learnings from this weekend to take forward to the rest of the season. We bought it home and a 1-2 for the Team was ideal, Checo had a great race and did very well today. I\u2019m already looking forward to Miami and seeing what we can do there.\u201d Sergio Perez, 1st \u201cIt has been an unbelievable weekend, I am super pleased and I cannot say more about the Team, it has been a tremendous day for us and I am so proud of everyone. I want to say a big thanks to Thibaut, he is one of my mechanics who is at home for personal reasons, but he is still a very big part of our Team. The Team enjoy calling me the King of the Streets, I am super happy for them all. They have been tremendous all weekend, from the sprint race yesterday through to the way we executed the race today, it was perfect. I think today we were the fastest car on track and regardless of the safety car we would have won the race. I am definitely in the fight for the title, not just because of Baku, I believe I can be very good anywhere this season and now I am just thinking of Miami. There are a lot of races coming up and we must make sure we are on it.\u201d Christian Horner, Team Principal \u201cCheco absolutely excelled today. He had the pace and really controlled the race, he benefitted from the timing of the safety car but it was a phenomenal performance from him today and all weekend. Hats off to him. We were unlucky with the safety car and the pit stop for Max. Sometimes things like that don\u2019t go your way but that is racing and we will learn from it. Other than that it was an excellent performance from the whole team, another 1-2, our 25th! Things are clicking for us at the moment and it sets us up well for next week but it is still early days, there are 19 races and 5 more sprint races in this long season. With each race comes moments to savour but just as many learnings, we take those and move to the next challenge, preparation for Miami is already well under way, see you at the beach!\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 3 BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Race winner Sergio Perez of Mexico and Oracle Red Bull Racing celebrates with teammates in parc ferme during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

From there, he had a lonely race in third but at least scored his first podium of the season.

We maximised every session throughout the weekend and couldn't have done anything differently, so that\u2019s something to be happy about and the team did a great job. The bottom line is that we have to focus on race pace and tyre management and push to make even more progress in the coming races.\" Carlos Sainz, 5th \"This has been a very difficult weekend. P5 brings home some points but I must put my hand up and admit I lacked confidence under braking and the pace was not there. On the Medium tyre I could push a bit more, but with the harder compound I simply didn\u2019t feel the car. Now I look forward to a reset, as Miami is just around the corner and I can\u2019t wait to jump in the car again and keep pushing.\" Fred Vasseur, Team Principal \"Overall, this has been a positive weekend for the team. We took two pole positions and one podium finish with Charles and our overall points total, thanks also to Carlos\u2019 fifth place, is satisfactory. There were signs of progress in Melbourne, but they were overshadowed by the poor race result. In the four week break, we worked hard in Maranello and here in Baku we have made further progress which translated into a good result. \"We definitely are back to where we wanted to be in terms of qualifying, but there\u2019s still a significant gap to Red Bull in the race. However, we aim to fight them for the win and we are gearing up to do just that. It\u2019s a morale booster for the whole team to finish on the podium, something which we will carry forward as we prepare for next weekend\u2019s race in Miami.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Third placed Charles Leclerc of Monaco and Ferrari celebrates on the podium during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

He was finding the afternoon\u2019s running easy enough to spend much of the day chatting to his engineer about his set up, and suggesting improvements that could be utilised by his team mate behind. Speaking of, things seem pretty harmonious at Aston Martin with Stroll saying he wouldn\u2019t attack when the duo were running line astern, while Alonso said he was perfectly happy if he tried a move. READ MORE: 'Ferrari were quite lucky' declares Alonso as he narrowly misses out on podium finish at Azerbaijan GP Fernando Alonso, 4th \u201cI think we had a tricky weekend with the DRS issue on Friday and Saturday, but despite this we have finished only one second away from the podium at the chequered flag. With that in mind, I have to be happy with fourth position and our overall performance which was encouraging all race. Thankfully today the DRS seemed to work fine, and our tyre management was strong. I thought the tailwind was quite random and here in Baku you are always on the edge. We only have to wait a few days before we go racing again, so let\u2019s see what we can do next week in Miami!\u201d Lance Stroll, 7th \u201cIt was pretty tough out there today. I was happy with my start, as well as the Safety Car restart, but I wasn\u2019t feeling super comfortable with the car once the race got going and made a slight mistake. A little misjudgement can end your day here, so I was fortunate to get away with brushing the wall and managed to continue with the race. Once Lewis [Hamilton] passed me, it was just about maintaining position and holding off George [Russell] for the remaining laps. He was pushing hard, but we managed the tyres well and I was able to keep him behind me. As a team, we definitely have a few things to work though ahead of Miami, but I think we need to be pleased to come away from the first Sprint weekend of the year with a decent haul of points to maintain second in the Constructors\u2019 Championship.\u201d Mike Krack, Team Principal \u201cAnother well-executed weekend by the entire team and we leave Baku with a combined total of 22 points. That is a good return from quite a challenging event on a very demanding street circuit. Full credit to the drivers who did an excellent job to make progress from their starting positions. They managed the Hard tyres well over a long stint, while maintaining good race pace, and brought the cars home safely to round off a clean weekend. This sets us up nicely for our first trip of the year to the United States next week as we get ready to entertain the fans in Miami.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W14 leads Fernando Alonso of Spain driving the (14) Aston Martin AMR23 Mercedes on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

As such his team mate actually jumped him, but Russell had a poor restart and was helpless to fight off his team mate on track as Hamilton streamed past. From there, Hamilton also picked off Stroll but ran out of time to make it past Sainz, while Russell was left with a free pit stop late on which he used to grab the bonus point for fastest lap. Lewis Hamilton, 6th \"The timing of the Safety Car wasn't ideal! I couldn't get bogged down in that frustration though. I had to keep my head down and get focused on attacking. That's what I did, and I got right back in the race. I really enjoyed those battles with the cars around me. The Ferrari of Sainz was just a little bit quicker on the straight than us, even with the DRS open. I gave it everything I had to get past though. \"I'm continuously proud of my team. We didn't have the pace that we did in Melbourne, which is not the greatest, but there is no lack of motivation in this team. We're all super hungry, and hopefully this is the beginning of something better in the coming races. Once I get that confidence in the car, the pace will come.\" George Russell, 8th \"I'm a little bit disappointed with myself today. I made a really good start and got in a decent position. I made a good move on Stroll to get past him into the pit lane but I then made a mess of the restart. I was defending from Lance and almost ran into the back of Fernando (Alonso). I then ran wide and got my tyres dirty. Ultimately that's why both Lance and Lewis got past. From there, it was line astern. \"I'll take the extra point for fastest lap but the only reason we had that opportunity was because we were in a bad position. It was close pace-wise between ourselves, Ferrari and Aston Martin and small differences can make a big change in terms of results. Whether we finish P4 or P8 though, it's far from first so we've got a lot of work to do.\" Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport \"Today was not a thriller. There was very little overtaking even with a big pace difference. We headed into a sub optimum set-up direction during FP1 and by the time we realised it was too late, and the car was in parc ferm\u00e9 conditions. It's the same for everyone though under this format. \"The pace in free air today looked similar between ourselves, the Ferraris and the Aston Martins. It was hard to tell who was ultimately quicker though, because with the difficulty of overtaking you are stuck where you are stuck. The Red Bulls meanwhile sailed away into the sunset on merit. If we can get the platform right though, I think we can close that gap this year. It's not about adding points of downforce, more giving the drivers a car that they have confidence in.\" Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director \"We're never going to get excited about sixth and eighth place, but it was a day where the car wasn't particularly quick and neither driver had much luck during the race. Lewis had a decent opening lap; he'd started to get a bit of pressure from Alonso towards the end of the stint, so we came in to protect the position. Unfortunately, that was the lap before the Safety Car, so he lost out. A good restart helped the recovery, but he just couldn't get past Sainz. \"George had a really good opening lap, getting through some key cars early on. He was able to take the stop under the Safety Car but then struggled on the restart and lost a couple of places. Similarly to Lewis, he just couldn't make a pass despite having a bit more pace so our only consolation was a point for fastest lap at the end. We haven't got long to wait before we are bringing some more performance to the car and in the meantime, we just need to focus on collecting as many points as possible. We're hoping the car will be a bit better suited to the track in Miami and looking forward to being able to get back on track in just a few days.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W14 comes in for a pitstop during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

Piastri had a tougher afternoon, contact with Albon at the start stalling his progress.

It was as good a result as I was going to get and the best we could achieve today. P9 really doesn\u2019t sound like a lot but it was the best we can do at the moment. We got a bit unlucky with the Safety Car happening just after we had pit. I then got stuck behind Hulkenberg, but we got a couple of points on the board, which is a solid result, plus we got some good things out of the new parts we bought to track. So, I\u2019m happy with that and we\u2019ll try to improve again in Miami.\u201d Oscar Piastri, 11th \u201cIt was a shame to miss out on points by one spot, but we were just lacking a bit of pace in the middle of the race, so there wasn\u2019t really much more we could do. I\u2019m happy I survived the weekend after being unwell and we\u2019ve got some really good learning in the bank. I certainly learned a lot about the tyres in that race, and how to manage them better, so all of that will help us fight for points next time. Thanks to the team here and back at the factory for getting the upgrades out to us, it's definitely helped. We go again in Miami.\u201d Andrea Stella, Team Principal \u201cAn interesting weekend in Azerbaijan with the new Sprint format. Our main objective for the weekend remained preparing for the race: this was where the most points were available. The top four teams are a little bit ahead at the moment, so the mission was to be at the head of the midfield. We achieved that thanks to the upgrades we fitted this weekend. Thanks go to the team back at the factory and at track for helping us bring these parts to the car. Over the next few races, we will be able to verify how much of that is a genuine improvement, and how much was track-specific. \u201cLando, once again, was rock solid. Another clean weekend brings us a couple of very useful points. We were highly impressed with Oscar too.

I am happy to be racing again next week so I forget this weekend as soon as possible.\u201d Yuki Tsunoda, 10th \u201cIt was a tough race today but the team, especially the mechanics, did a great job to repair the car after yesterday. The engineers found a strong set-up, even if we lost some time in sector two. We didn\u2019t get many chances to do long runs this weekend but to be able to demonstrate a strong pace, and build on this performance throughout the race, was awesome from the team. I am also happy with my performance. I was consistent, and being sandwiched between the two McLarens meant any mistake would cost us the point. It took a lot of concentration but in the end, we were able to achieve another top-ten finish. There is still room for development and improvement to fight for points consistently, but I have confidence in my team to race stronger in the future.\u201d Franz Tost, Team Principal \u201cFirstly, congratulations to Red Bull Racing for another front-row finish. As for our weekend, we came to this race with some aero updates, and I\u2019m pleased to say they seem to work very well. The team in Bicester did a fantastic job because we have been competitive from the very beginning of the weekend. The highlight was of course Friday\u2019s qualifying, where Yuki finished in eighth position. As for today\u2019s race, he was overtaken by Stroll and Russell on the first lap, but this is what I expected as their cars are simply faster than ours. Nevertheless, Yuki did a fantastic job. He was able to split the McLarens, staying quite close to Norris and keeping Piastri behind. Overall, a big congratulations to Yuki for another strong performance, which shows how much he is improving race by race. Unfortunately, Nyck had an accident, he touched the wall in turn 5, breaking the front left track rod, and that was the end of his race. Generally speaking, we have improved the car performance dramatically since the start of the season, so now I am even more looking forward to the next race in Miami.\u201d Guillaume Dezoteux, Head of Vehicle Performance \u201cWe are very happy to end the weekend with a point. Yuki drove a solid race, the strategy calls were right and the pit stop was competitive. At the start of the race, we knew it would be difficult to hold faster cars behind us, but Yuki remained focused, made no mistakes and settled in a train of cars with both McLarens, a Haas and an Alpine. We were continuously evaluating safety car scenarios and monitoring other cars to react, although in the end, there was nothing to react to. Nyck's race started well with an offset strategy. We decided to start on the hard tyre, chasing any opportunity to make ground through the pack. Unfortunately, he made contact with the inside of Turn 5 and broke his front left track rod, which forced him to stop on track. Overall, this weekend has been solid and the track layout has suited us better. There are similarities in Miami, so we will review everything in the next couple of days to prepare as best we can for next weekend.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04 on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

(Photo by Bryn Lennon - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images) Info Close\n\nWilliams Albon tangled with Piastri off the line, in a first lap incident. His car was okay to continue, but he spent most of the race stuck in a DRS train and unable to make progress. The same could be said for Sargeant, who pitted under the Safety Car but didn\u2019t have the pace to really fight those around him. Better races to come from Williams, who need to find a way to convert their one-lap pace into race advantage. HIGHLIGHTS: Watch as Sergio Perez wins the 2023 Azerbaijan Grand Prix Logan Sargeant, 16th \"All things considered I learned a lot this weekend. In the race today, we got a bit unlucky with the safety car timing at the start and fell into a bit of a lonely, frustrating race. I was stuck behind Zhou for most of it. By the time he pitted it was just too late and I was too far disconnected from the pack ahead. However, when I did get in front, the car felt good, I was driving well, and the pace was not too bad at the end. I brought a set of hard tyres a long way and that\u2019s all positive. \"Our one lap pace this weekend was good, and I was happy considering we only had one free practice session to go into qualifying and have a pretty good one. It was going to be an even better Sprint Shootout until the crash, so I\u2019ll learn from that and move forward. The race wasn\u2019t bad, it just fell out of our hands and was a lonely, boring one for most people.\" Alex Albon, 12th \"It was really tough out there today. I had some damage on my front wing for most of the race following contact with the McLaren, so there was a lot of management to do. It was tricky trying to keep the Haas behind me whilst staying close to Oscar, and not a lot of room for overtaking with the shortened DRS zones. We really did maximise this weekend and I think it was personally one of my strongest, especially coming off Australia. I think we definitely have more to find with the car, but I think I\u2019m becoming at one with it, so hopefully we can keep this going.\" Dave Robson, Head of Vehicle Performance \"Alex suffered some front wing damage on the opening lap, which hurt the car balance and cost him downforce. Despite this he was able to put together another very strong race; he dealt with the pressure from Gasly and Magnussen brilliantly whilst also staying close to Piastri ahead. The timing of the early safety car was unfortunate for our strategy, but that is the nature of racing at Baku. Having missed the sprint race yesterday, Logan started the Grand Prix somewhat on the back foot but still put together a strong drive to fight with Zhou and Gasly. His pace and car management were competitive and gave him some very valuable learning for the future. \"We arrived in Baku for this new style sprint event expecting it to be a challenge. Although we rose to that challenge well and were able to put together a strong performance overall, it is frustrating not to get some points for our effort. Nonetheless, we head to Miami with some positive momentum and another good opportunity to challenge the top 10.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 1 BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Alexander Albon of Thailand driving the (23) Williams FW45 Mercedes leads Pierre Gasly of France driving the (10) Alpine F1 A523 Renault on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan. (Photo by Francois Nel/Getty Images) Info Close\n\nHaas Magnussen\u2019s bad luck continued, as he suffered front wing damage after running out of room at the start and colliding with Bottas. He tried hard from there on in, but wasn\u2019t able to climb back into the points. Hulkenberg had started from the pit lane and went for a very long first stint in the hopes a late Safety Car would offer him a free pit stop, but his tyres went off the cliff and he dropped back through the field. Nico Hulkenberg, 17th \"It was hard work \u2013 I was head-down, focused. It was a quali race to be honest for me, that was all I had but it was okay for 40 laps or so and then at the end, unfortunately the tyres started to drop quite rapidly. The Safety Car didn\u2019t come out and that\u2019s what we needed with the strategy we pursued. Nevertheless, it was good learning. We elected for a pit lane start and changed the set up completely to something more conventional. We learned something, on the positive side, and now onto Miami where I think we\u2019ll be more competitive.\" Kevin Magnussen, 13th \"We were stuck in traffic the whole race, we had pace for much more but just couldn\u2019t pass. Unfortunately, with the wing we have it\u2019s really fast with no DRS but with DRS it doesn\u2019t really have a big impact. Overtaking is very difficult, defending is pretty good because without DRS we\u2019re pretty fast. That little detail made the difference today because I think looking at the cars ahead I was way quicker than them but just couldn\u2019t get past. A bit of the same story as last year as we were in the points until the end but this year, we had even more pace. Hopefully that carries onto Miami, and we will try again.\" Guenther Steiner, Team Principal \"Kevin got his front wing endplate knocked off at the start because Bottas in front of him locked up, so he couldn\u2019t avoid him, and it was severe enough to make a front wing change. With Nico, we tried a different strategy and it didn\u2019t work because the Safety Car came too early. All in all, the performance of the car was good and we could hold pace with the Alpine and McLaren. I think we just have to take this one as a little dip and come back in Miami, where maybe for our car it\u2019s even better, being a medium-downforce circuit.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Kevin Magnussen of Denmark and Haas F1 looks on on the grid prior to the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

(Photo by Francois Nel/Getty Images) Info Close\n\nAlpine Alpine\u2019s difficult weekend continued on Sunday. Gasly pitted very early to get onto the hard compound, but as such lost out when the Safety Car came out. He pitted again, one of the few to try a two-stop strategy which wasn\u2019t the quickest way to the flag. As for Ocon, he climbed into the top 10 after starting in the pit lane on the hard tyres, and pitted on the very last lap as he desperately tried to hang on for a second Safety Car, which never came. Esteban Ocon, 15th \u201cWe gave it everything we could today, going for the Hail Mary strategy in the hope for a late Safety Car or incident, but things did not go our way. We can be proud with our efforts, pushing all the way to the end and extracting the most from the Hard tyres. I had a bit of a scary moment at the end of the race when I came into pit and saw people congregating in the Pit Lane even though the race had not ended. Fortunately, nothing happened, but we must make sure these scenarios don\u2019t happen again. We were not where we want to be in terms of performance this weekend. And, after a weekend of learning, we have a chance to review and comeback stronger in Miami. I know we will do just that.\u201d Pierre Gasly, 14th \u201cThis is a weekend all of us are keen to quickly move on from as it\u2019s been a very frustrating one for all of us at the team. We have to make sure this kind of performance is not repeated again. Clearly, it is not where we should be and we need to come back stronger for Miami next week on a more conventional track. In terms of my race, we tried something different on strategy and hoped for some fortune, but in the end, we couldn\u2019t do much more. I made a couple of moves, that\u2019s always satisfying, but it\u2019s much more rewarding when those overtakes are for points. I\u2019m looking forward to racing in Miami next weekend.\u201d Otmar Szafnauer, Team Principal \u201cIt\u2019s been a bitterly disappointing weekend for the team in Baku and we must not repeat this type of performance again. We very much started on the backfoot on Friday and since then we were not able to make any kind of recovery in any of the sessions. We were quite far off on car set-up on Friday during practice and with such limited running \u2013 notably with some reliability issues on both cars \u2013 we left ourselves with a mountain to climb for the remainder of the weekend. We must limit these problems going forward and begin all Grand Prix weekends on the front-foot to make sure we give ourselves the best possible chance on Saturday and Sunday to score points. We demonstrated our race pace in Australia and we have a better chance to validate our upgrade package in Miami. We must keep working hard as a team, keep up our understanding of how to maximise the most from our package and target a much-improved overall team performance next weekend Stateside.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Pierre Gasly of France driving the (10) Alpine F1 A523 Renault on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

(Photo by Alex Pantling/Getty Images) Info Close\n\nAlfa Romeo Not to be for Alfa in Baku. Bottas collided with Magnussen at the start which dropped him back through the field, and from there struggled more than most with tyre wear. He pitted three times in the end on his way to last place. At least he saw the chequered flag though \u2013 Zhou was called in to the pits midway through to retire the car with technical issues. Valtteri Bottas, 18th \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a great race for us and we were never in the mix for the points: we need to understand what happened and, most importantly, how to get back to being competitive. My race was hard from the start: I had a contact in turn two, I was on the outside and I was hit from the left and from behind, which left me with some damage. It was quite a long race after that: we tried to find a way back in, as anything can happen here, but eventually there weren\u2019t any chances for us to rebuild our race. For sure, we need to improve our pace and do everything we can to move forward. We head straight to Miami now: it is a very different track from this, we will stay motivated and go for it again.\u201d Zhou Guanyu, DNF \u201cQuite the weekend to forget for us: it\u2019s never nice to DNF, but realistically we didn\u2019t have a chance to score points today. We needed to retire the car as a precaution as we had rising temperatures and alarms on my dash. In general, it was a tough weekend for all of us. We need to understand the reasons for this and work hard, all of us, to make a step forward. I am confident this team can do that, I see it in the people here and at home. We will do all in our power to get back where we expect to be and continue to improve.\u201d Alessandro Alunni Bravi, Team Representative \u201cThis was a disappointing race and it showed that, right now, our package is not competitive enough to score points. The priority for everyone of us in the team \u2013 here at the track and back at base \u2013 is to work hard and make the improvements necessary to get back where we expect to be. The field remains tight, and we can get back into this battle: but we must deliver a step forward to do so. We are all fully committed to this and we\u2019re going to do whatever it takes to get there.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari comes in for a pitstop during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

            "article_html": "<div><h3>Red Bull</h3>\n<p>After being streets ahead of the opposition in FP3 and making it a clean sweep of practice sessions, pole looked to be Verstappen&#8217;s for the taking, especially when he wound up nearly half a second clear of the field in Q1. But disaster struck at the start of Q2 when he suffered an issue with his transmission, ending his involvement much earlier than expected. That left Perez to fly the flag for the team, which he did with ease, grabbing his second ever pole. Both have come here in Jeddah, but he'll be hoping for more luck than he had in this race last year.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.jeddah-pole-sitter-perez-hoping-to-keep-lion-alonso-at-bay-as-he-predicts.7Boc44yQpZe2VNr6woATFO.html\">READ MORE: Jeddah pole-sitter Perez hoping to keep &#8216;lion&#8217; Alonso at bay as he predicts how much Verstappen can recover from P15</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Max Verstappen, 15th, No time set in Q2</strong></p>\n<p>The driveshaft broke out of Turn 10 on the right rear so that was it for qualifying. It happened really out of the blue, we hadn&#8217;t had any issues before that. It was annoying because the car was good up until then, I was comfortable in every session and every time I was on the track, I was quick, so for sure we could have fought for pole. Instead, we now have a bit more work ahead of us tomorrow but it is what it is, it is a long Championship and we will stay positive. I think a win is tricky from that position but I will try to score as many points as possible. It will be hard to get to the front, but we won&#8217;t give up. Anything is possible at this track, we have seen some crazy things here, but we have to be realistic. It will be tough but we have good pace so, for sure, we will move forward.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Sergio Perez, 1st, 1:28.265</strong></p>\n<p>\"I certainly enjoy the track here in Jeddah. The car came alive at high speeds and I was able to push right to the limit to secure pole position. That said, it has been tricky today. You can lose two tenths through the early section of corners if you&#8217;re not careful, especially with the low downforce that we&#8217;re running, so I&#8217;m very happy to come away with pole. It will be very interesting to see what happens in the race tomorrow, especially with some of the other cars running high downforce. As we saw last year, anything can happen. We have a good race car and showed strong race pace on Friday, so let&#8217;s hope Max can also push up the grid and together, we can aim for maximum points for the Team.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Christian Horner, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;A tale of two qualifying sessions out there today. Firstly, a brilliant performance from Checo. He drove incredibly well and put down a fantastic lap which sees him on pole; his second pole here in Jeddah, back to back. On the other hand, its hugely frustrating for Max, a drive shaft failure knocked him out of qualifying when we were really just getting started in Q2. His lap in Q1 would have put him in P4 for the race tomorrow. It is a real shame, but we are already in the process of understanding the issue. Max has a mountain to climb from 15th, but knowing Max, he will rise to the challenge and it will certainly be interesting to see what he achieves. For Checo, its about sticking with the strategy, staying out of trouble and surviving those early lap. Plenty of action to come and plenty to look forward to.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Sergio Perez of Mexico and Oracle Red Bull Racing prepares to\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Max Verstappen of the Netherlands driving the (1) Oracle Red Bull\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Sergio Perez of Mexico and Oracle Red Bull Racing prepares to drive in the garage during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 18, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

It wasn&#8217;t a smooth session for the team either, with Sainz encountering traffic and Leclerc struggling with tyre warm up. But both drivers scraped into Q3 and from there, the Monegasque showed why he is regarded as one of the best qualifiers in the field by grabbing a brilliant second. He won&#8217;t start there though thanks to a 10-place grid penalty, which will bump his team mate up the order.</p>\n<p><strong>Charles Leclerc, 2nd, 1:28.420</strong></p>\n<p>\"I'm happy with my lap, it was on the limit and we finished further up the order than we expected to in this session. However, our competitors are strong and we still have a lot of work to do. Our race pace looks solid this weekend. It's not easy to overtake on this track, so I will do my best to fight my way back to the front tomorrow.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Carlos Sainz, 5th, 1:28.931</strong></p>\n<p>\"Not the best of qualifyings from my side to be honest. I struggled with the tyres into the first few corners and lost the time there. The rest of the lap felt good, but it wasn&#8217;t enough to make up for sector 1. My bad. However, the weekend is not over and we have the pace to fight for a step on the podium, so we&#8217;ll reset tonight and come back at it tomorrow in the race.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Fred Vasseur, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was a decent quali for the team today with Charles P2, one tenth off Perez  &#8211; which will become P12 with the penalty - and Carlos fifth fastest. Our pace was not too bad but we need a step forward. It&#8217;s a pity for Carlos because he had to put on a second set of Softs in Q2 and at the end, in Q3 he only had one set and made a small mistake, which probably cost him the front row. However, Carlos had good pace and he&#8217;ll start P4, which gives him a good opportunity. Looking at tomorrow, our race pace was good yesterday and on the long stints we had low degradation, also thanks to the fact this track is very grippy, very different to Bahrain. It could be a strange race because it&#8217;s quite easy on paper to overtake but actually, we could see a DRS train which could be a game changer. We need to find good track position and the right slot for the pit stops.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Second placed qualifier Charles Leclerc of Monaco and Ferrari\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Carlos Sainz of Spain driving (55) the Ferrari SF-23 on track\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Second placed qualifier Charles Leclerc of Monaco and Ferrari looks on in parc ferme during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 18, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

As Verstappen unexpectedly fell by the wayside, it even looked like the Spaniard might grab pole, but in the end Perez and Leclerc had a little too much pace. But starting second with a car that is better in race trim still leaves him likely to be in the reckoning for the win. Stroll, still battling with his injuries, isn&#8217;t too far back either.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.battling-perez-for-victory-not-the-target-says-alonso-despite-qualifying-on.FwiR0jnEgbn9osUaANRfA.html\">READ MORE: Battling Perez for victory &#8216;not the target' says Alonso despite qualifying on the front row at Jeddah</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Fernando Alonso, 3rd, 1:28.730</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;All in all we have to be very happy with starting on the first row of the grid tomorrow. It is a very different circuit compared to Bahrain and to see us fighting in Q3 again is a positive sign. The track did evolve during the session, but maybe not as much as we anticipated, especially from Q2 to Q3. Our strength in this package has been on the long runs, so hopefully we can optimise this as much as possible tomorrow. It is very tight between a number of teams so tomorrow will be an interesting battle for sure. But with both cars starting inside the top five positions, our main goal is to come away from this race with as many points as possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Lance Stroll, 6th, 1:28.945</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;The team delivered a really strong qualifying performance today and we have put ourselves in a great position to fight for a good haul of points in the race tomorrow. We were not sure whether the pace we saw in Bahrain would translate to such a different circuit here in Jeddah, but the car felt good and we were able to keep pushing the limits throughout qualifying. My final lap was going well, and I went purple in the first sector, but I made a small mistake at Turn 22 and lost two or three tenths. Still, starting fifth is a good result; we have a competitive race car, and there is all to play for tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Mike Krack, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;A strong performance by the entire team this week gives us a great opportunity and confidence for tomorrow. We will start from the front row with Fernando and fifth with Lance, and we will continue pushing hard to convert today&#8217;s speed into results tomorrow. The lead up to qualifying was pretty smooth: we did our homework on Friday and in final practice, and both drivers were happy with the car balance heading into qualifying. We expect a very close race tomorrow with the teams around us. It is usually an intense race here; it can be unpredictable, and you always have to be reactive and avoid mistakes. But we are ready to fight and we know we have a good race car.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Third placed qualifier Fernando Alonso of Spain and Aston Martin\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Lance Stroll of Canada driving the (18) Aston Martin AMR23\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Third placed qualifier Fernando Alonso of Spain and Aston Martin F1 Team looks on in parc ferme during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 18, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Fourth becomes third for Russell thanks to Leclerc&#8217;s grid penalty which isn&#8217;t a shabby starting berth. Their car has looked more stable here so they could well be in the fight tomorrow, if they can get on top of their tyre degradation that Hamilton was complaining about in practice.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.i-dont-feel-connected-to-this-car-hamilton-upset-after-miserable-jeddah.3XL8pYLIiJ8vKZLr792w8e.html\">READ MORE: &#8216;I don&#8217;t feel connected to this car&#8217; &#8211; Hamilton left to rue &#8216;miserable&#8217; Jeddah qualifying</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Lewis Hamilton, 8th, 1:29.223</strong></p>\n<p>\"I struggled a little bit today, but we just need to keep trying. No matter what changes we've been making, we've been struggling to extract the speed, and I just don't feel properly connected to the car at the moment. That is something we will work on to improve the confidence in the next races. George did a great job today though and he wasn't that far off some of the cars at the front, so we just need to keep pushing. It wasn't the greatest of days but there are improvements for the Team. Tomorrow is a new day, and we will keep working at it.\"</p>\n<p><strong>George Russell, 4th, 1:28.857</strong></p>\n<p>\"We have exceeded the potential and our own expectations to be ahead of an Aston Martin and a Ferrari. It is a solid job; we put in a lot of work overnight. The team back at Brackley were working hard in the simulator and we did a lot of work trackside this morning to try and get more out of the package. We know we are not in the fight for pole just yet, but you have to maximise what you've got, and we certainly did that today. We have a fight on our hands tomorrow, most likely with the Aston Martins and the Ferraris. We will be pushing hard to get on the podium and seeing what we can do. This Team has higher standards and expectations for themselves than just finishing in the top three, but we will be giving everything we've got to be standing there on Sunday.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport</strong></p>\n<p>\"I think today is about where we expected to be. We know the deficits that we have and two tenths faster or slower can move us up or down a few positions; we know we need to make bigger steps forward than this, though, in the races to come. I think pace-wise tomorrow we are with the Aston Martins and the Ferraris; at least that is per the long runs yesterday, so we should be able to play around in the race. Lewis's lap looked a bit sticky in sector one, so we need to look into that. The time never came together for him, but he was as fast or faster than George in the rest of the lap, and we need to evaluate what effect the differences in set-up had.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director</strong></p>\n<p>\"It's been a difficult weekend to get the car in the right place and I don't think George could have got any more out of it with his laps in the final session. We've benefited from Max's issues and Charles' penalty to end up third on the grid, but George still had to get ahead of a number of key cars that were all pretty quick. Lewis had a tough time through the sessions, struggling with the balance and grip in the first sector. He had a very solid morning so it's a bit of a surprise but hopefully we'll see strong pace tomorrow. The race here normally has a few incidents so how well you do is often a function of whether they fall at the right times. Only a few places separate our cars so it gives us an opportunity to split them on strategies so we can cover the bases. Hopefully we'll be a bit kinder on the tyres than we were in Bahrain; we've tried to work on the setup to achieve that and we'll find out tomorrow if we've made progress.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Sparks fly behind George Russell of Great Britain driving the (63)\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W14 on track during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 18, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Once there Gasly struggled with his tyres as he felt the cooler track was going away from him and had to settle for P10, but Ocon managed to out-qualify a Mercedes on his way to seventh. Starting sixth, he is in a great place to atone for that raft of time penalties last time out.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.i-thought-it-was-over-admits-ocon-as-he-describes-pedal-to-metal-q3-lap-at.6uv7bBkKxIBdzI274UgTvr.html\">READ MORE: 'I thought it was over' admits Ocon as he describes 'pedal to metal' Q3 lap at Jeddah</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Esteban Ocon, 7th, 1:29.078</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;That was an intense qualifying session and a strong performance all around, so a good job by the entire team. Overall, I&#8217;m happy with seventh today. We&#8217;re starting in sixth with Charles&#8217; [Leclerc] penalty and it&#8217;s all to play for from the third row tomorrow. During Qualifying, the car was the strongest it&#8217;s felt all weekend and it&#8217;s good to see that we&#8217;ve improved day by day, session by session, so credit to the team for that. Tomorrow we&#8217;ll aim to have a clean race and bring both cars home in the points. It&#8217;s a long race where strategy will be important and we&#8217;re all fully focused on a strong result.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Pierre Gasly, 10th, 1:29.357</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I have mixed feelings after today&#8217;s Qualifying. While I&#8217;m pleased to reach Q3, I still feel we came up a little bit short on our expectations today and there&#8217;s some finer details we need to work on to make sure we extract the maximum from our package. It&#8217;s great that we have both cars inside the top ten &#8211; credit to Esteban on a good job &#8211; and it means we&#8217;re in a strong position for the race where the aim is to score solid points. Our race pace has been good, we showed that in Bahrain, and in Practice yesterday, and I&#8217;m feeling confident that double points are achievable.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Alan Permane, Sporting Director</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s Qualifying is a significant improvement from the first race of the season and it&#8217;s certainly satisfying to have both cars reach Q3 and starting in a competitive place on the grid for tomorrow&#8217;s race. Esteban did a great job with a well-executed session, which he built up lap by lap, and delivered when he needed to in an extremely tight field, split by small margins. It was important for Pierre to have a smooth session, especially after Bahrain Qualifying. He&#8217;s now put himself in contention for strong points tomorrow and we&#8217;re certainly feeling good with how our long run pace has looked so far this season. A decent job today, some small details to fix, and we&#8217;re looking forward to seeing what we can achieve tomorrow with both cars.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Esteban Ocon of France driving the (31) Alpine F1 A523 Renault in\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Pierre Gasly of France and Alpine F1 prepares to drive in the\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Esteban Ocon of France driving the (31) Alpine F1 A523 Renault in the Pitlane during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 18, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

As for Piastri, after the disappointment of a Q1 exit in Bahrain, he made it all the way to the top 10 in Jeddah. Showing why he is so highly regarded, he managed to out-qualify Gasly to boot and starts right in the mix in eighth.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.piastri-says-maiden-q3-in-jeddah-wasnt-expected-as-norris-shoulders-blame.29ifv1ICQtrzDnVze7yVG3.html\">READ MORE: Piastri says maiden Q3 in Jeddah 'wasn&#8217;t expected' as Norris shoulders blame for Q1 barrier strike</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Lando Norris, 19th, 1:30.447</strong></p>\n<p>\"I made a silly mistake, it&#8217;s disappointing because it cost me a chance to go into Q3 today.

He kept improving session-by-session through practice and run-by-run in qualifying where he put together clean laps and extracted the maximum from the car.</p>\n<p>\"Lando will have his chance tomorrow in the race, as the car looks competitive, and races here can often be eventful.</p>\n<p>\"I would like to thank very much all the team at the factory and trackside, for their hard work to deliver some upgrades at this race.

He had looked exceptionally quick all evening, often in amongst the front runners but lost his first lap time in Q2 to track limits. On the back foot, traffic didn&#8217;t help his cause and he just missed out on the top 10. As for Magnussen, he hasn&#8217;t quite been on his team mate&#8217;s pace here but a good start will see him not too far away from the points come tomorrow.</p>\n<p><strong>Nico Hulkenberg, 11th, 1:29.451</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s always so tight, there are very fine margins. My first lap time got deleted and that obviously took the banker away, so Q3 might&#8217;ve been possible, but small things make a difference. Moving up to P10 isn&#8217;t bad and we can definitely race from there, so we&#8217;ll give it our all tomorrow. I&#8217;m confident we have decent pace in the midfield pack.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Magnussen, 13th, 1:29.634</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was less than two tenths, and we had some issues on the car so it&#8217;s a shame when it&#8217;s so tight. I think it was a fast car today and Q3 was there but better luck next time. Our problem was brakes related and the car also wouldn&#8217;t downshift properly. We&#8217;re not in a horrible position for tomorrow so let&#8217;s give it a good one.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Guenther Steiner, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>\"We&#8217;re pretty happy with our qualifying result even if it could be a little bit better. It&#8217;s all theoretical but we could get two cars into Q3 &#8211; I think we have the performance &#8211; but Q2 wasn&#8217;t flawless. Kevin had problems with his gear shifting and the gearbox, and brake issues. Nico also had a bit of a brake issue, and we were a little bit on the backfoot with timings because of the weighbridge and in the end, we didn&#8217;t make it.

We were close to making it into Q3, and the car felt good, which gives me confidence ahead of the race. On the whole, our weekend had been a bit challenging until now, with some pace lacking in qualifying conditions: today was an improvement, and if we can have good race pace, we can be hopeful to put up a good fight tomorrow. Points are always the target and I am confident it&#8217;s a realistic one.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Zhou Guanyu, 12th, 1:29.461</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I am quite happy with our performance today, and overall, satisfied about the step up in qualifying I made from Bahrain. There were no mistakes, and I was able to maximise everything I had. Unfortunately, we fell a bit short of Q3, and it is obviously frustrating to miss out on our target for just half a tenth. Nevertheless, I think we made a step forward as a team from where we were at the start of the weekend. The aim, like in every race, is to get in the mix for the top ten and bring home points &#8211; I think we can achieve that tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Alessandro Alunni Bravi, Team Representative</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We have made a step forward from yesterday and made up most of the gap we had from our rivals, which is testament to the good work done by our team here and in Hinwil overnight. We knew qualifying would be decided by the smallest margins, and indeed we missed out on a spot in Q3 with Zhou, who did an excellent job in the cockpit, by half a tenth &#8211; next to nothing on such a long track. Our qualifying performance was not dissimilar from what we did in Bahrain, and our aim is to have another strong race to put our cars in the points once again. Our race pace looks solid and we know we can execute a good race with both Zhou and Valtteri, so we are confident to be in the mix to retain our fifth place in the rankings tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Zhou Guanyu of China driving the (24) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Valtteri Bottas of Finland and Alfa Romeo F1 prepares to drive\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Zhou Guanyu of China driving the (24) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari on track during final practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 18, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

At a track that he hadn&#8217;t previously raced at when he desperately needed lap time, the Dutchman was forced to sit out of FP3 entirely thanks to a late, unscheduled PU change. He then spun at the start of qualifying and wrecked a set of tyres, and from there was always playing catch up. But the car wasn&#8217;t competitive, with even Tsunoda&#8217;s experience not counting for much as he also exited in Q1.</p>\n<p><strong>Yuki Tsunoda, 16th, 1:29.939</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We ended up P16, one-hundredth of a second from P15. It is definitely a shame, but I'm happy with the lap I put together and how we progressed throughout qualifying. As for the car itself, we have to find some more grip and performance to consistently get into Q2 and Q3. Overall, I think we could benefit from what we learnt over the last couple of days, so the team did a good job there. Tomorrow is a new day and I hope the race pace will be good. My main target will be to focus on myself, give one hundred per cent, and score some points!&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Nyck de Vries, 18th, 1:30.244</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Jumping into qualifying without driving any laps in FP3 made it a tricky day. Given the unique layout of the circuit, getting the tyres into the right window for a flying lap is difficult, so I heavily locked up the rears going into Turn 1. My last run was pretty decent though, but we lost a lot in the last sector. It's a shame we missed that, and I am disappointed because the potential to make it into Q2 was there. We want to be further ahead, and the team is working together closely to extract the most out of the car.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Jody Egginton, Technical Director</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Today has not been as straightforward as it should have been. We identified an issue with Nyck&#8217;s car during the fire-up today and, being time-limited, we elected to change the PU meaning he missed out on FP3 running, which is far from ideal as it&#8217;s his first time here. However, all credit to his mechanics for getting the car turned around efficiently. Yuki completed his programme but struggled a bit more than yesterday with grip and balance in FP3, meaning both sides of the garage went into qualifying on the back foot for one reason or another. Nyck pushed hard in Q1 from the very beginning and came unstuck with a spin on his first run, but the car was undamaged and he recovered very well on his second run. Unfortunately, he only lost out on Q2 due to hitting the energy limit a bit early, so we need to look into this. Yuki ran the planned qualifying programme without too much fuss and was also super close to making the cut, missing out by only 0.01 seconds to Bottas. In the end, no matter how close we may have been, we haven't made it into Q2 in what is a very tight midfield. As such, the aero updates for R03 are eagerly anticipated to start moving the car's performance forwards. Our thoughts now shift to the race where we will focus on getting both cars moving forward to take advantage of any opportunities which might present themselves.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Yuki Tsunoda of Scuderia AlphaTauri and Japan  during qualifying\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Nyck de Vries of Netherlands driving the (21) Scuderia AlphaTauri\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Yuki Tsunoda of Scuderia AlphaTauri and Japan  during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 18, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

As for Sargeant, he set a time good enough for Q2 only to see it wiped from the timing sheets thanks to track limits. Frustrated, the American then half spun to leave himself really up against it. On his final push lap, he bounced over the kerbs and only just avoided clipping the wall, but did enough damage to the car to have to stop out on track.</p>\n<p><strong>Logan Sargeant, 20th, No time set in Q1</strong></p>\n<p>\"I put in a very fast lap but it was deleted as I crossed the pitlane entry by a margin. There was no performance gain so it&#8217;s frustrating, but I still had two more laps to deliver and I didn&#8217;t, so my apologies go to the team as they deserved more today. We need to take the positives from today, put this behind us and bounce back. The car is quick, we have a lot of straight-line speed and fortunately it can be a crazy race here in Jeddah and there can be a lot of positions to pick up. Although I&#8217;ve given myself a lot more work than I needed to, I&#8217;m quite optimistic about tomorrow and I&#8217;ll make it up to the team.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Alex Albon, 17th, 1:29.994</strong></p>\n<p>\"We struggled with the rear tyres in qualifying, so we&#8217;ll have a look and understand why. We've been quick all weekend so it's just frustrating. Looking to tomorrow, we have a decent car in the race so I think we can do a good job. Today is obviously disappointing but hopefully we can turn something around for tomorrow.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Dave Robson, Head of Vehicle Performance</strong></p>\n<p>\"Q1 was incredibly tight and today we were just on the wrong side of the cut-off. Although Logan&#8217;s first lap was deleted, his pace was legitimate and showed what the car was capable of. Alex struggled a bit more to get the tyres into a state where he was comfortable to attack the start of the lap and was therefore unable to get everything out of the car over a single lap.</p>\n<p>\"Logan will have learned a lot from today and although he is frustrated at the result, this experience will be invaluable going forwards. It is disappointing not to have progressed further into qualifying, but the car had good pace at high fuel yesterday and both drivers can have strong races tomorrow.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: 17th placed qualifier Alexander Albon of Thailand and Williams\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Logan Sargeant of United States and Williams climbs from his car\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: 17th placed qualifier Alexander Albon of Thailand and Williams walks in the Pitlane during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 18, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

The C4 also showed itself to be a very versatile tyre in the final session that determined the grid, both on a flying lap as well as over longer runs. Q1 demonstrated how it was possible to have a good level of grip also on the second and third attempts with the same set of tyres, using cool-down laps in between.</p>\n<p>\"The opportunity to have a tyre with these characteristics already presented itself on certain circuits last year, and we&#8217;ve seen that once more here today. On an unusual track like Jeddah, the method of preparing the tyres varied from team to team: another element that underlined the particular characteristics of the C4 combined with those of the different teams using them.</p>\n<p>\"From a strategy point of view, all the data collected so far this weekend confirms a one-stopper as being the quickest option, with only small differences between the three possible combinations. This is also bearing in mind the high likelihood of neutralisations and possible stoppages, from what we have seen at the two previous grands prix held here to date.\"</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.highlights-relive-the-action-from-a-dramatic-qualifying-session-in-jeddah-as.3mNa7w7Kb56uUbWfN8rrck.html\">HIGHLIGHTS: Relive the action from a dramatic qualifying session in Jeddah as Perez seals his second career pole</a></strong></p>\n\n    </div>",
            "text": "Red Bull After being streets ahead of the opposition in FP3 and making it a clean sweep of practice sessions, pole looked to be Verstappen\u2019s for the taking, especially when he wound up nearly half a second clear of the field in Q1. But disaster struck at the start of Q2 when he suffered an issue with his transmission, ending his involvement much earlier than expected. That left Perez to fly the flag for the team, which he did with ease, grabbing his second ever pole. Both have come here in Jeddah, but he'll be hoping for more luck than he had in this race last year.

It happened really out of the blue, we hadn\u2019t had any issues before that. It was annoying because the car was good up until then, I was comfortable in every session and every time I was on the track, I was quick, so for sure we could have fought for pole. Instead, we now have a bit more work ahead of us tomorrow but it is what it is, it is a long Championship and we will stay positive. I think a win is tricky from that position but I will try to score as many points as possible. It will be hard to get to the front, but we won\u2019t give up. Anything is possible at this track, we have seen some crazy things here, but we have to be realistic. It will be tough but we have good pace so, for sure, we will move forward.\u201d Sergio Perez, 1st, 1:28.265 \"I certainly enjoy the track here in Jeddah. The car came alive at high speeds and I was able to push right to the limit to secure pole position. That said, it has been tricky today. You can lose two tenths through the early section of corners if you\u2019re not careful, especially with the low downforce that we\u2019re running, so I\u2019m very happy to come away with pole. It will be very interesting to see what happens in the race tomorrow, especially with some of the other cars running high downforce. As we saw last year, anything can happen. We have a good race car and showed strong race pace on Friday, so let\u2019s hope Max can also push up the grid and together, we can aim for maximum points for the Team.\u201d Christian Horner, Team Principal \u201cA tale of two qualifying sessions out there today. Firstly, a brilliant performance from Checo. He drove incredibly well and put down a fantastic lap which sees him on pole; his second pole here in Jeddah, back to back. On the other hand, its hugely frustrating for Max, a drive shaft failure knocked him out of qualifying when we were really just getting started in Q2. His lap in Q1 would have put him in P4 for the race tomorrow. It is a real shame, but we are already in the process of understanding the issue. Max has a mountain to climb from 15th, but knowing Max, he will rise to the challenge and it will certainly be interesting to see what he achieves. For Checo, its about sticking with the strategy, staying out of trouble and surviving those early lap. Plenty of action to come and plenty to look forward to.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Sergio Perez of Mexico and Oracle Red Bull Racing prepares to drive in the garage during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 18, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

It wasn\u2019t a smooth session for the team either, with Sainz encountering traffic and Leclerc struggling with tyre warm up. But both drivers scraped into Q3 and from there, the Monegasque showed why he is regarded as one of the best qualifiers in the field by grabbing a brilliant second. He won\u2019t start there though thanks to a 10-place grid penalty, which will bump his team mate up the order.

However, our competitors are strong and we still have a lot of work to do. Our race pace looks solid this weekend. It's not easy to overtake on this track, so I will do my best to fight my way back to the front tomorrow.\" Carlos Sainz, 5th, 1:28.931 \"Not the best of qualifyings from my side to be honest. I struggled with the tyres into the first few corners and lost the time there. The rest of the lap felt good, but it wasn\u2019t enough to make up for sector 1. My bad. However, the weekend is not over and we have the pace to fight for a step on the podium, so we\u2019ll reset tonight and come back at it tomorrow in the race.\" Fred Vasseur, Team Principal \"It was a decent quali for the team today with Charles P2, one tenth off Perez \u2013 which will become P12 with the penalty - and Carlos fifth fastest. Our pace was not too bad but we need a step forward. It\u2019s a pity for Carlos because he had to put on a second set of Softs in Q2 and at the end, in Q3 he only had one set and made a small mistake, which probably cost him the front row. However, Carlos had good pace and he\u2019ll start P4, which gives him a good opportunity. Looking at tomorrow, our race pace was good yesterday and on the long stints we had low degradation, also thanks to the fact this track is very grippy, very different to Bahrain. It could be a strange race because it\u2019s quite easy on paper to overtake but actually, we could see a DRS train which could be a game changer. We need to find good track position and the right slot for the pit stops.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Second placed qualifier Charles Leclerc of Monaco and Ferrari looks on in parc ferme during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 18, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

As Verstappen unexpectedly fell by the wayside, it even looked like the Spaniard might grab pole, but in the end Perez and Leclerc had a little too much pace.

It is a very different circuit compared to Bahrain and to see us fighting in Q3 again is a positive sign. The track did evolve during the session, but maybe not as much as we anticipated, especially from Q2 to Q3. Our strength in this package has been on the long runs, so hopefully we can optimise this as much as possible tomorrow. It is very tight between a number of teams so tomorrow will be an interesting battle for sure. But with both cars starting inside the top five positions, our main goal is to come away from this race with as many points as possible.\u201d Lance Stroll, 6th, 1:28.945 \u201cThe team delivered a really strong qualifying performance today and we have put ourselves in a great position to fight for a good haul of points in the race tomorrow. We were not sure whether the pace we saw in Bahrain would translate to such a different circuit here in Jeddah, but the car felt good and we were able to keep pushing the limits throughout qualifying. My final lap was going well, and I went purple in the first sector, but I made a small mistake at Turn 22 and lost two or three tenths. Still, starting fifth is a good result; we have a competitive race car, and there is all to play for tomorrow.\u201d Mike Krack, Team Principal \u201cA strong performance by the entire team this week gives us a great opportunity and confidence for tomorrow. We will start from the front row with Fernando and fifth with Lance, and we will continue pushing hard to convert today\u2019s speed into results tomorrow. The lead up to qualifying was pretty smooth: we did our homework on Friday and in final practice, and both drivers were happy with the car balance heading into qualifying. We expect a very close race tomorrow with the teams around us. It is usually an intense race here; it can be unpredictable, and you always have to be reactive and avoid mistakes. But we are ready to fight and we know we have a good race car.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Third placed qualifier Fernando Alonso of Spain and Aston Martin F1 Team looks on in parc ferme during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 18, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

No matter what changes we've been making, we've been struggling to extract the speed, and I just don't feel properly connected to the car at the moment. That is something we will work on to improve the confidence in the next races.

Tomorrow is a new day, and we will keep working at it.\" George Russell, 4th, 1:28.857 \"We have exceeded the potential and our own expectations to be ahead of an Aston Martin and a Ferrari. It is a solid job; we put in a lot of work overnight. The team back at Brackley were working hard in the simulator and we did a lot of work trackside this morning to try and get more out of the package. We know we are not in the fight for pole just yet, but you have to maximise what you've got, and we certainly did that today. We have a fight on our hands tomorrow, most likely with the Aston Martins and the Ferraris. We will be pushing hard to get on the podium and seeing what we can do. This Team has higher standards and expectations for themselves than just finishing in the top three, but we will be giving everything we've got to be standing there on Sunday.\" Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport \"I think today is about where we expected to be. We know the deficits that we have and two tenths faster or slower can move us up or down a few positions; we know we need to make bigger steps forward than this, though, in the races to come. I think pace-wise tomorrow we are with the Aston Martins and the Ferraris; at least that is per the long runs yesterday, so we should be able to play around in the race. Lewis's lap looked a bit sticky in sector one, so we need to look into that. The time never came together for him, but he was as fast or faster than George in the rest of the lap, and we need to evaluate what effect the differences in set-up had.\" Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director \"It's been a difficult weekend to get the car in the right place and I don't think George could have got any more out of it with his laps in the final session. We've benefited from Max's issues and Charles' penalty to end up third on the grid, but George still had to get ahead of a number of key cars that were all pretty quick. Lewis had a tough time through the sessions, struggling with the balance and grip in the first sector. He had a very solid morning so it's a bit of a surprise but hopefully we'll see strong pace tomorrow. The race here normally has a few incidents so how well you do is often a function of whether they fall at the right times. Only a few places separate our cars so it gives us an opportunity to split them on strategies so we can cover the bases. Hopefully we'll be a bit kinder on the tyres than we were in Bahrain; we've tried to work on the setup to achieve that and we'll find out tomorrow if we've made progress.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W14 on track during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 18, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

My first lap time got deleted and that obviously took the banker away, so Q3 might\u2019ve been possible, but small things make a difference.

We were close to making it into Q3, and the car felt good, which gives me confidence ahead of the race. On the whole, our weekend had been a bit challenging until now, with some pace lacking in qualifying conditions: today was an improvement, and if we can have good race pace, we can be hopeful to put up a good fight tomorrow. Points are always the target and I am confident it\u2019s a realistic one.\u201d Zhou Guanyu, 12th, 1:29.461 \u201cI am quite happy with our performance today, and overall, satisfied about the step up in qualifying I made from Bahrain. There were no mistakes, and I was able to maximise everything I had. Unfortunately, we fell a bit short of Q3, and it is obviously frustrating to miss out on our target for just half a tenth. Nevertheless, I think we made a step forward as a team from where we were at the start of the weekend. The aim, like in every race, is to get in the mix for the top ten and bring home points \u2013 I think we can achieve that tomorrow.\u201d Alessandro Alunni Bravi, Team Representative \u201cWe have made a step forward from yesterday and made up most of the gap we had from our rivals, which is testament to the good work done by our team here and in Hinwil overnight.

Our qualifying performance was not dissimilar from what we did in Bahrain, and our aim is to have another strong race to put our cars in the points once again.

At a track that he hadn\u2019t previously raced at when he desperately needed lap time, the Dutchman was forced to sit out of FP3 entirely thanks to a late, unscheduled PU change. He then spun at the start of qualifying and wrecked a set of tyres, and from there was always playing catch up. But the car wasn\u2019t competitive, with even Tsunoda\u2019s experience not counting for much as he also exited in Q1. Yuki Tsunoda, 16th, 1:29.939 \u201cWe ended up P16, one-hundredth of a second from P15. It is definitely a shame, but I'm happy with the lap I put together and how we progressed throughout qualifying. As for the car itself, we have to find some more grip and performance to consistently get into Q2 and Q3. Overall, I think we could benefit from what we learnt over the last couple of days, so the team did a good job there. Tomorrow is a new day and I hope the race pace will be good. My main target will be to focus on myself, give one hundred per cent, and score some points!\u201d Nyck de Vries, 18th, 1:30.244 \u201cJumping into qualifying without driving any laps in FP3 made it a tricky day. Given the unique layout of the circuit, getting the tyres into the right window for a flying lap is difficult, so I heavily locked up the rears going into Turn 1. My last run was pretty decent though, but we lost a lot in the last sector. It's a shame we missed that, and I am disappointed because the potential to make it into Q2 was there. We want to be further ahead, and the team is working together closely to extract the most out of the car.\u201d Jody Egginton, Technical Director \u201cToday has not been as straightforward as it should have been. We identified an issue with Nyck\u2019s car during the fire-up today and, being time-limited, we elected to change the PU meaning he missed out on FP3 running, which is far from ideal as it\u2019s his first time here. However, all credit to his mechanics for getting the car turned around efficiently. Yuki completed his programme but struggled a bit more than yesterday with grip and balance in FP3, meaning both sides of the garage went into qualifying on the back foot for one reason or another. Nyck pushed hard in Q1 from the very beginning and came unstuck with a spin on his first run, but the car was undamaged and he recovered very well on his second run. Unfortunately, he only lost out on Q2 due to hitting the energy limit a bit early, so we need to look into this. Yuki ran the planned qualifying programme without too much fuss and was also super close to making the cut, missing out by only 0.01 seconds to Bottas. In the end, no matter how close we may have been, we haven't made it into Q2 in what is a very tight midfield. As such, the aero updates for R03 are eagerly anticipated to start moving the car's performance forwards. Our thoughts now shift to the race where we will focus on getting both cars moving forward to take advantage of any opportunities which might present themselves.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: Yuki Tsunoda of Scuderia AlphaTauri and Japan during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 18, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

As for Sargeant, he set a time good enough for Q2 only to see it wiped from the timing sheets thanks to track limits. Frustrated, the American then half spun to leave himself really up against it. On his final push lap, he bounced over the kerbs and only just avoided clipping the wall, but did enough damage to the car to have to stop out on track. Logan Sargeant, 20th, No time set in Q1 \"I put in a very fast lap but it was deleted as I crossed the pitlane entry by a margin. There was no performance gain so it\u2019s frustrating, but I still had two more laps to deliver and I didn\u2019t, so my apologies go to the team as they deserved more today. We need to take the positives from today, put this behind us and bounce back. The car is quick, we have a lot of straight-line speed and fortunately it can be a crazy race here in Jeddah and there can be a lot of positions to pick up. Although I\u2019ve given myself a lot more work than I needed to, I\u2019m quite optimistic about tomorrow and I\u2019ll make it up to the team.\" Alex Albon, 17th, 1:29.994 \"We struggled with the rear tyres in qualifying, so we\u2019ll have a look and understand why. We've been quick all weekend so it's just frustrating. Looking to tomorrow, we have a decent car in the race so I think we can do a good job. Today is obviously disappointing but hopefully we can turn something around for tomorrow.\" Dave Robson, Head of Vehicle Performance \"Q1 was incredibly tight and today we were just on the wrong side of the cut-off. Although Logan\u2019s first lap was deleted, his pace was legitimate and showed what the car was capable of. Alex struggled a bit more to get the tyres into a state where he was comfortable to attack the start of the lap and was therefore unable to get everything out of the car over a single lap. \"Logan will have learned a lot from today and although he is frustrated at the result, this experience will be invaluable going forwards. It is disappointing not to have progressed further into qualifying, but the car had good pace at high fuel yesterday and both drivers can have strong races tomorrow.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 18: 17th placed qualifier Alexander Albon of Thailand and Williams walks in the Pitlane during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 18, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
