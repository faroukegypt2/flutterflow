We've got an upgrade on the car that we've had for two races now. At least on the simulator, it's shown to be a bit more effective in the high-speed than the low-speed.\n\n\"And we haven't really had too many high-speed tracks in the last two races, and it's the first time we've seen the package working on a quick circuit. It's looking quite good, but we've got to keep ourselves grounded. It's chipping away.\"\n\nAlbon noted that strong wins are an issue this weekend: \"The way that it is this weekend, it's so strong, it doesn't feel good around here. It feels terrible for everyone, but clearly less terrible for us than others.\"",

Yes, but that's the standard. In fact, the standard is higher than that.</p>\n<p>\"This is where I think we have to have a middle step. You have to show people the pathway, lead them down the pathway and make sure you support them and provide them with the equipment that allows them to do the same thing.</p>\n<p>\"The other thing on people is that very clearly at Mercedes, you could attract near enough anyone you wanted one with phone call.\"</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p>   <img src=\"//cdn-6.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YEQn3ELY/s1000/james-vowles-williams-team-pri-1.jpg\" alt=\"James Vowles, Williams team principal \"> \n<p class=\"title\">James Vowles, Williams team principal</p>\n<p class=\"photographer\">Photo by: Williams</p>\n<p>According to Williams' Head of vehicle Performance Dave Robson, Vowles' fresh perspective and Mercedes experience has made the team realise that there is \"more to do than we thought there was. Getting his experience of what state-of-the-art genuinely looks like has been quite enlightening.\"</p>\n<p>Thankfully for Vowles, his new team appears to have embraced his approach rather than hit the snooze button on his overdue wake-up call.</p>\n<p>\"If the organisation had rejected me, we would have had a problem,\" he said. \"But it hasn't, it's done the complete opposite.</p>\n<p>\"This organisation knows that we need to change that we need to move on.

            "text": "During the off-season, Vowles moved from a Mercedes team that won eight consecutive world championships to a squad that finished bottom in four of the past five seasons.\n\nAfter years of underinvestment, Williams' facilities were always going to pale compared to the Brackley squad, but Vowles found out some elements are a world away from what is needed to compete at the front.\n\nWhen asked by Motorsport.com what the difference was between Williams and a top team like Mercedes, he said: \"I think everything. There are not many, but some elements of the organisation that are of a similar level to Mercedes.\n\n\"There are some elements that are 20 years out of date, which makes sense if you think through the history of this team. The investment it had was zero for around about 20 years and then an investment firm came through.\n\n\"Fundamentally, we're in a situation where a lot of facilities were almost preserved from where they were 20 years ago.\n\n\"Composites is behind what I knew when I first joined the sport with a different team 20 years ago...\"\n\nAlex Albon, Williams FW45 Photo by: Mark Sutton / Motorsport Images\n\nBut according to Vowles it is not just the Grove team's equipment, but also the staff that must evolve if it is to aspire to the highest standards.\n\n\"If you took a group of people and hid them away, and another group of people hid them away, they evolve to different stages,\" he explained. \"And that's what's happened, the view of what excellence is is completely different to what it really is today, and you have to move things forward.\n\n\"Internally, a lot of the work I've been asking them to do has been likened to asking us to do three years of development in six months. Yes, but that's the standard. In fact, the standard is higher than that.\n\n\"This is where I think we have to have a middle step. You have to show people the pathway, lead them down the pathway and make sure you support them and provide them with the equipment that allows them to do the same thing.\n\n\"The other thing on people is that very clearly at Mercedes, you could attract near enough anyone you wanted one with phone call.\"\n\nJames Vowles, Williams team principal Photo by: Williams\n\nAccording to Williams' Head of vehicle Performance Dave Robson, Vowles' fresh perspective and Mercedes experience has made the team realise that there is \"more to do than we thought there was. Getting his experience of what state-of-the-art genuinely looks like has been quite enlightening.\"\n\nThankfully for Vowles, his new team appears to have embraced his approach rather than hit the snooze button on his overdue wake-up call.\n\n\"If the organisation had rejected me, we would have had a problem,\" he said. \"But it hasn't, it's done the complete opposite.\n\n\"This organisation knows that we need to change that we need to move on. That we need to evolve to have success, and everyone is ready to do that.\"\n\nIf Williams is to address its ageing facilities, it will need some help from F1 and the FIA to allow teams to pour more resources into infrastructure outside of the cost cap.\n\nCurrently teams have a $36m capital expenditure allowance over a four-year period, which is not enough to cover big ticket items unless teams request a specific exemption, which Aston Martin used for its new wind tunnel.\n\nVowles found an ally in Alpine's Otmar Szafnauer, who warned F1 against \"baking in the top teams' advantage\" by leaving the allowance untouched, and a solution is set to be signed off next month.\n\n\"Formula 1 and the FIA have been very supportive,\" Vowles added. \"Within the first week of being here, I showed them: 'This what I had a Mercedes, here's what I have at Williams. There's zero chance that we will be able to compete with this.'\n\n\"And I think where we are now is that by July that will be signed and teams like ourselves will be able to invest to catch back up.\"",

to sixth after the Red Bull driver&#8217;s latest qualifying woes, making a series of late moves to finish ahead of Aston Martin&#8217;s Fernando Alonso, Williams&#8217; Alex Albon and the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz.</p>\n<p>Williams almost had two cars in the points on home soil, with Logan Sargeant a personal best 11th, followed by the Alfa Romeo of Valtteri Bottas, who started at the back after being excluded from qualifying, and Nico Hulkenberg, who dropped to the rear early on when he picked up front wing damage on his Haas.</p>\n<p>Lance Stroll wound up 14th after being penalised for causing a collision with Pierre Gasly, who was forced to retire thereafter, joining team mate Esteban Ocon, who pitted early on amid apparent technical trouble &#8211; and Magnussen on the sidelines.</p>\n<p>Zhou Guanyu was 15th in the other Alfa Romeo, having made three pit stops (one more than anyone else), with AlphaTauri pair Yuki Tsunoda and Nyck de Vries the final drivers to cross the line after Gasly&#8217;s aforementioned dramas.</p>\n<p>After the chequered flag, there was no hiding Verstappen&#8217;s excitement as he not only moved 99 points clear of Perez in the drivers&#8217; standings, but also gave Red Bull a record-equalling 11th successive F1 win.</p>\n\n    <h3>AS IT HAPPENED</h3>\n<p>A change to the starting grid post-qualifying saw Bottas dropped from 15th to 20th and last, having been excluded from the session after his Alfa Romeo stopped out on track in Q1 and the team failed to provide a sufficient fuel sample thereafter.</p>\n<p>As the drivers returned to Silverstone for race day, the rain seen in that grid-deciding session had cleared and been replaced by brighter skies, but the threat of further showers could not be counted out, while strong winds added to the challenge once again.</p>\n<p>A couple of minutes before the race start, the tyre blankets came off to reveal that most drivers had chosen medium tyres for their first stints, while Russell, Ocon, Tsunoda and De Vries chose softs and Hulkenberg and Bottas opted for hards.</p>\n<p>When the lights went out, Norris sent the home crowd wild as he bolted off the line and charged his way past Verstappen for the lead into Turn 1, with the Dutchman having to go defensive to keep the other McLaren of Piastri behind over the next few corners.</p>\n<p>Behind the top three runners, Leclerc held fourth from the fellow fast-starting Russell, who made the most of his soft tyres, with Sainz, Alonso, Gasly, Hamilton (having run wide and lost a place at Village) and Albon holding the final top 10 positions.</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"NORTHAMPTON, ENGLAND - JULY 09:

perilously close to contact, while the other Mercedes of Hamilton set about overhauling Alonso for P8, repeating Verstappen&#8217;s move on Norris on Lap 7.</p>\n<p>With Norris and Piastri back in the

            "text": "Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen overcame an early attack from McLaren rival Lando Norris to triumph in an action-packed British Grand Prix, marking his first-ever victory at this event and extending his current winning run to six races. Norris jumped Verstappen for the lead at the start, with team mate Oscar Piastri almost following him through, meaning it was a Red Bull in a McLaren sandwich over the first few laps \u2013 but the reigning double world champion soon fought back. AS IT HAPPENED: Follow all the action from the 2023 British Grand Prix By Lap 5, and with DRS at his disposal, Verstappen reclaimed P1 from Norris and never looked troubled, pulling away from the home favourite as the race developed and then managing a late Safety Car period \u2013 caused by Kevin Magnussen\u2019s smoking Haas \u2013 that saw the leaders go for different tyre strategies. While the majority of the front-runners chose soft tyres under the Safety Car, Norris went for hards, meaning he had to pull off some impressive defending to remain P2 over fellow Briton Lewis Hamilton, who jumped Piastri when the race was neutralised. Piastri had held third for the majority of the 52-lap encounter, only to pit just before the aforementioned Safety Car, but fourth \u2013 a couple of seconds up on the other Mercedes of George Russell \u2013 still represented the best result of the Australian rookie\u2019s burgeoning F1 career.\n\nFORMULA 1 ARAMCO BRITISH GRAND PRIX 2023 Great Britain 2023 Race results POSITION TIME POINTS 1 Max Verstappen VER Red Bull Racing 1:25:16.938 26 2 Lando Norris NOR McLaren +3.798s 18 3 Lewis Hamilton HAM Mercedes +6.783s 15 4 Oscar Piastri PIA McLaren +7.776s 12 5 George Russell RUS Mercedes +11.206s 10\n\nSergio Perez delivered another solid recovery drive to sixth after the Red Bull driver\u2019s latest qualifying woes, making a series of late moves to finish ahead of Aston Martin\u2019s Fernando Alonso, Williams\u2019 Alex Albon and the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz.

As the order filtered through after those stops, Verstappen (softs) held P1 from Norris (hards), with Hamilton (softs) jumping Piastri (hards) for third, Russell (mediums) holding fifth and lamenting a missed opportunity over the radio, Alonso (softs) in sixth and Sainz (hards), Perez (softs), Albon (softs) and Leclerc (mediums) rounding out the top 10. \u201cWonderful, huh?\u201d Norris sarcastically commented when his engineer informed him of the tyres the cars around him were running, given that only 15 laps remained \u2013 the Safety Car still circulating \u2013 and both McLarens were on the hardest tyres. At the end of Lap 38, the Safety Car peeled into the pits and released the pack of cars into green flag conditions once more \u2013 Verstappen mastering the restart on softer rubber to hold the lead from Norris and Hamilton, who looked lively and ready to attack his fellow Brit. What followed was a thrilling, multi-lap exchange between the youngster and the seven-time world champion, Norris making his McLaren as wide as possible on several occasions as his tyres came up to temperature to keep the Mercedes behind.\n\nThe late Safety Car led to some mixed tyre strategies for the final stint\n\n\u201cThat McLaren is so quick on those hards \u2013 impressive,\u201d Russell commented from P5, behind the other chrome-liveried MCL60 of Piastri, with Alonso, Sainz, Perez, Albon and Leclerc still holding onto the final points-paying positions. Meanwhile, Gasly jumped on the radio to demand that Stroll return P11 to him after a move around the outside of Stowe. Up front, Verstappen commented that his soft tyres were \u201cnot feeling that good\u201d, but his times were still several tenths quicker than Norris, while team mate Perez sparked a demise for Sainz with a move at Club \u2013 Albon and Leclerc swiftly following him through. With the stewards taking no action over Stroll\u2019s initial, bold pass on Gasly, the pair would clash again after battling Sainz for the final point, making contact into Club and leaving the Alpine with apparent suspension damage, forcing him into retirement. This time, Stroll was given a five-second penalty for his actions. Perez\u2019s charge continued with a pass on Alonso into Stowe for P6, while Albon, Leclerc and Sainz brought back memories of previous eras as Williams \u2013 celebrating their 800th Grand Prix \u2013 went toe-to-toe with Ferrari on merit.\n\nVerstappen controlled the Safety Car restart before pulling clear again\n\nAs the final laps ticked down, Verstappen continued to stretch out his lead over Norris, eventually crossing the line just under four seconds clear to bag his eighth win of the season, with Hamilton finishing three seconds further back to make it two Brits on the podium. Piastri took a fine fourth in the other McLaren, despite the opportunity of a podium going begging, followed by Russell, Perez and Alonso, with Albon, Leclerc and Sainz scoring the final points of the day after their squabble. Sargeant almost made it a double points finish for Williams in 11th, followed by Bottas and Hulkenberg, who recovered from their respective qualifying and early-race troubles, with the penalised Stroll ending up 14th. Zhou was 15th after a third stop to swap to softs under the Safety Car, with Tsunoda and De Vries the last drivers to cross the line in 16th and 17th respectively \u2013 Gasly six laps down after his incident with Stroll and Magnussen and Ocon the two DNFs.\n\nNorris and Hamilton celebrate on the podium",

            "text": "Just over a month after parting ways with Team Principal Jost Capito, Williams announced they had signed Mercedes\u2019 Motorsport Strategy Director James Vowles to fill that post. F1 Correspondent Lawrence Barretto looks at how and why the deal came about\u2026 Williams are F1\u2019s second most successful team in terms of constructors\u2019 championships won, but have struggled to replicate that form and compete at the front since the turn of the century. They have finished last three times in the last four years. READ MORE: Williams announce Mercedes strategy chief James Vowles as new team boss Owners Dorilton Capital decided late last year that things needed to change, and thus parted ways with Capito \u2013 while removing FX Demaison from his role as Technical Director. At the time, they didn\u2019t have a replacement ready to go, with sources suggesting there were more than 10 under consideration. Vowles was high on their list \u2013 and Dorilton moved swiftly, getting the deal over the line in a month or so. Vowles says he told Mercedes boss Toto Wolff of the offer \u201ca few weeks ago, into the New Year\u201d and said the Austrian, as he expected, was \u201cincredibly good\u201d about the news.\n\nVowles makes the move to Grove-based Williams for 2023 after 21 years in Brackley\n\nThat Vowles has been cleared to start work in just a few weeks (February 20) without the need of chunky garden leave suggests not only do Wolff and Vowles have a very close relationship \u2013 the strategist having become a close confidant and part of Wolff\u2019s inner circle \u2013 but also that the association Mercedes have with Williams through their technical partnership is tight too. Williams shift strategy with Vowles appointment Though Capito had experience in F1, his stint with Sauber was almost 20 years ago, while he was at McLaren for just a few months. His pedigree came from rallying, through immense success with Volkswagen. READ MORE: Wolff backs Vowles to make \u2018fantastic\u2019 impact at Williams as he explains new Mercedes structure And while he did make changes to Williams that moved departments away from working in silos, it became clear to the owners that it will take at least five years, if not a decade to get back to the front \u2013 and stay there. At 64, Capito wasn\u2019t the person to do that, Williams having already coaxed him out of retirement to do the job. In Vowles, they have someone who is ambitious \u2013 and for whom such a big, long-term project comes at the right time in his career, having gathered recent F1 experience and been integral to success in this formula.\n\nWilliams have brought Vowles in as the replacement for former team boss Capito\n\nVowles has spent 21 years at the Brackley-based operation, joining when they were British American Racing (BAR) and staying through their iterations as Honda, Brawn GP and now Mercedes. During that time, the outfit won nine constructors\u2019 championships. In recent years, his role has expanded from focusing on strategy to contributing to the overall future direction of the F1 team. Having spent so much time entrenched in that culture, Vowles will take that experience and way of working, which will be permanently etched in the way he goes about his job, and apply it as best as he can at Williams. READ MORE: \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a massive leap\u2019 \u2013 Vowles not daunted by team boss role as he prepares for Williams switch It\u2019s a chance to test himself in a high-profile role for the first time and to develop the skills that he will hope will ensure a long tenure at Williams, while also making him attractive to other teams, including perhaps a return move to Mercedes as and when Wolff decides to pursue a different path. The last time Williams took on a senior recruit from Mercedes, it didn\u2019t go well. Paddy Lowe joined as Chief Technical Officer \u2013 when Claire Williams oversaw the day-to-day running of the operation \u2013 but left a couple of years later after the team failed to get a car ready in time for the start of 2019 testing. This scenario is different. While Lowe was highly-rated at the time, it was believed Wolff wanted to move Lowe on. This was not the case with Vowles, a trusted ally of Wolff, who in an ideal world would have preferred for his \u201csparring partner\u201d to stay.\n\nVowles has the task of moving Williams off the foot of the F1 constructors\u2019 standings\n\nVowles should be afforded time by Dorilton to come in and assess what needs to be done, before being given more time to making changes and begin building the foundations to long-term success. It will be interesting to see how Vowles tackles the new role, whether he can step up and deliver, and what other changes he needs to make \u2013 with the support of the owners \u2013 to the structure and culture, to give Williams a chance of recapturing former glories.

Wolff knew that keeping hold of the best people forever wasn\u2019t realistic. Even if Mercedes have been the dominant force for close to a decade, the very best will always be hungry for the next challenge.

The official photographs released by Williams today of their new FW45 \u2013 the real car, not a computer render \u2013 conform to a trend we are seeing of teams re-arranging their radiator packaging, with less in the front of the sidepods and more up around the shoulder area. Alfa Romeo, Haas and now Williams have all done this with their 2023 cars. It can be seen that the front corners of the sidepods in plan view are now slimmer while from side-on we can now see a clear Red Bull-like bodywork \u2018cannon\u2019 for the cooling air from the shoulders, exiting either side of the central exhaust at the rear. In general, it looks like a convergence towards what Red Bull did in 2022. ANALYSIS: Why AlphaTauri\u2019s livery launch gave us some fascinating clues about the AT04\n\nFW44 (bottom) and FW45 (top) views from side-on suggest that the floor inlets at the lower front of the sidepod have been given more space in which to fit. The bodywork \u2018cannon\u2019 along the side of the engine cover defining the cooling route to the rear outlets confirms the re-siting of radiator area from the front of the sidepod to the shoulders.\n\nLast year when Williams introduced the heavily revised version of the FW44 at the British Grand Prix, engineering chief Dave Robson said that ideally they would have liked to have re-arranged the radiators as well as the bodywork, but that it was not feasible within the cost cap constraints. It looks like those changes have now been made. The aim seems to be to create the space around the front of the sidepods to move the inlets for the underfloor slightly further back. Although this shortens the length of the downforce-creating underfloor tunnels, it moves the car\u2019s centre of aerodynamic pressure further back. This has been deemed desirable by many teams who last year found that the more forward centre of pressure gave them a car which, combined with the very powerful underfloor, gave a very inconsistent balance through the corners. ANALYSIS: It\u2019s all change at Williams in 2023 \u2013 but can they change their fortunes on track?\n\nFW44 (bottom) and FW45 (top) show how the outer top corners of the sidepods have been pared back as a result of re-siting some of the radiator core beneath the bodywork.\n\nTypically, it could be unstable at the rear upon corner entry but then understeering by mid corner. This was particularly so with the Williams, even in its upgraded post-Silverstone form. Slimming the lower front of the sidepods down by moving radiator area away from there to further up the car creates the space to allow the inlet tunnels for the floor to be shaped in a way more sympathetic to keeping a consistent aerodynamic balance. This looks to be the foundation upon which Williams will strive in 2023 to reduce its performance deficit to the front.

The Japanese racer is joined by a rookie in De Vries, who comes very highly rated from the Mercedes family. How those two get on against each other will be fascinating to watch \u2013 with AlphaTauri looking to improve on a slightly disappointing P9 championship finish.

Will the American manage to make the step up to Formula 1 seamlessly? Williams need him to, as they seek to avoid propping up the table once more. ANALYSIS: Why Williams promoted American Sargeant to a race seat in 2023\n\nWilliams will hope Albon and Sargeant make a tasty pairing for 2022",

We\u2019ve only seen the new cars run for three days as they took to the circuit last week for pre-season testing \u2013 but how do they rank at this early stage? Day 1 of testing saw Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen set the fastest time before Alfa Romeo\u2019s Zhou Guanyu lit up the timesheets on Day 2, and Verstappen\u2019s team mate Sergio Perez capped off the test with the fastest lap of the whole test on Day 3. Our data team have crunched the numbers and \u2013 with the usual caveats that it's hard to be definitive given unknowns like fuel loads and setups \u2013 this is how they reckon the order is looking ahead of the new season... READ MORE: The 5 key questions from 2023 pre-season testing in Bahrain\n\n10. Williams\n\nSmooth sailing for Williams rookie Logan Sargeant and his new team mate in Bahrain\n\nWilliams' only reliability concern over the three days of pre-season testing was a small electrical issue, as rookie Logan Sargeant and team mate Alex Albon notched up an impressive 439 laps of the Bahrain International Circuit, which is as good a return as they could hope for. As for the performance of the FW45, Albon said the car was \"definitely quicker\" than last year's version. Whether we saw the true potential of it last week remains to be seen, and right now they sit at the bottom of the Power Rankings. That doesn't mean they haven't improved; it means there might be more to come from the sleeping giants. WINNERS AND LOSERS: Who aced 2023 F1 pre-season testing and who has work to do ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix? 9. Haas\n\nHaas notched 414 laps over the three days, with the team's fastest tour set by Kevin Magnussen\n\nHaas got some solid running on the board as Kevin Magnussen set the seventh-fastest time of testing on Day 3 and Nico Hulkenberg got his eye in once again. Test driver Pietro Fittipaldi said the team were around P5-P7 in the charts but our data might hint that, at this stage before the opening Grand Prix, they're perhaps not at the level of Alpine and Aston Martin \u2013 but this midfield is so competitive that a small swing in their favour could go a long way. Furthermore, Haas seem to enjoy Bahrain \u2013 it's where Magnussen pulled off his \"Viking comeback\" in 2022... BARRETTO: Testing has given us a fascinating insight into the pecking order for 2023 \u2013 but the full story is going to be even juicier 8. AlphaTauri\n\nAlphaTauri finished ninth in last year's standings \u2013 can they move up the order this season?\n\nAlphaTauri led the mileage stakes in Bahrain with 456 laps of the circuit that will also host this weekend's season-opener. Yuki Tsunoda and rookie team mate Nyck de Vries clearly encountered no bugs with their AT04, but the team's pace was hard to read as Tsunoda managed a fast flying lap only at the end of the third day \u2013 which might have been a low-fuel quali run. So we haven't had a proper read on the Faenza team's pace, but our preliminary data hints that they're only just above Haas and Williams in the stakes. Again, the same caveats as above apply in this tight midfield scrap. ANALYSIS: How do McLaren, Haas, AlphaTauri and more stack up after pre-season testing in Bahrain? 7. McLaren\n\nNot the ideal start for McLaren, who pushed for P4 in the standings last season\n\nMcLaren were one of the surprises from pre-season testing, and not for the reasons they would have liked. The team in orange seemed to struggle with aerodynamic efficiency and further issues sprung up at the front of the car with their front wheel brows needing strengthening, which hampered rookie Oscar Piastri and team mate Lando Norris. As a result, McLaren managed just 312 laps over the three days and our data put them in the bottom half. Perhaps they didn't get a representative quali or race run in, but it's not a great start for the Woking team. READ MORE: More points and prizes, mini leagues and boosters \u2013 How to get the most out of F1 Fantasy in 2023 6. Alfa Romeo\n\nA brace of red flag-triggering issues aside, Alfa Romeo have cause to smile\n\nAlfa Romeo's Zhou Guanyu topped the timesheets on Day 2 with a run on C5 tyres and it would really be something if they do that again in qualifying this Saturday. It's fair to assume that this was not a lap worth reading too much into and our data backs that up, putting Alfa Romeo in the midfield battle. But there are reasons to be optimstic for Alfa Romeo and fans of Valtteri Bottas and Zhou, because it does look like they've made some improvements over last year. Two significant reliability issues during the three days of testing might be reason for concern, however. WATCH: Jolyon Palmer\u2019s testing takeaways after three busy days in Bahrain 5. Alpine\n\nMore to come from last year's midfield-toppers Alpine?\n\nAlpine were bullish during launch season with their engineers showing off numerous aero changes and talking of a significant decrease in weight, but the team didn't seem to show their hand in testing: there were no blistering glory runs and their long runs were hard to read. New signing Pierre Gasly hinted that there was pace in the A523 but that race simulation on the final day was interrupted by a red flag. So our data put the team that finished fourth in last year's constructors' standings one step lower in this year's pre-season Power Rankings. VOTE: Which of the 10 teams impressed you most in 2023 pre-season testing? 4. Aston Martin\n\nAston Martin turned heads in Bahrain testing\n\nAston Martin's AMR23 looks like a big step up from last year's car, which saw the team finish seventh in the standings. Our data puts them fourth in the rankings before the opening Grand Prix \u2013 is that an outlandish or realistic expectation for Lance Stroll and Fernando Alonso? Well, Haas driver Magnussen and Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner have already pointed at Aston Martin as this year's most-improved in testing. It would be far-fetched to expect a Red Bull-beating display from Aston Martin but long runs and short runs were both favourable over the three days. Fernando Alonso was particularly fast and reserve driver Felipe Drugovich was no slouch as he replaced the injured Stroll in testing.

But where will he end up?\n\nDe Vries' performance for Williams at Monza came at the perfect time for the Dutchman\n\nOption 1: Williams Williams were impressed with his efforts when he drove the car in Spanish Grand Prix practice earlier this year. The 27-year-old diligently worked through the programme, got up to speed very quickly despite never having previously driven a 2022-spec car, and gave high quality feedback.

            "article_html": "<div><p>At the sharp end of the Formula 1 grid, it is crystal clear that Red Bull has stolen an early march at the start of the new season. Delivering on the immense promise shown by the RB19 in testing, <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/driver/max-verstappen/829269/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Max Verstappen</a> opened the campaign in Bahrain with pole position and an utterly controlled victory. Thanks to stablemate <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/driver/sergio-perez/829668/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sergio Perez</a> banking second at both times of asking, the team was just short of a point for fastest lap for a perfect score to kick off the campaign.</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p><a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/driver/fernando-alonso/829156/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fernando Alonso</a> stunned in wheel-to-wheel battle to complete the podium, while <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/driver/lance-stroll/840484/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lance Stroll</a> battling through injury to clock sixth proves the Aston Martin AMR23 is a rapid and confidence-inspiring creation. Although there are still questions concerning <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/team/ferrari/36466/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ferrari</a>&#8217;s tyre degradation and lingering unreliability, plus the <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/team/mercedes/36495/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mercedes</a> camp is crestfallen now that its car concept has been brutally exposed, neither are propping up the times.</p>\n<p>But which team has been slowest out of the blocks?</p>\n<p>Certainly, <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/team/williams/36474/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Williams</a> was the nailed-on backmarker in 2022 as its first crack at a new-era ground-effects car wanted for downforce and lower-speed cornering balance. This year&#8217;s FW45 marked a step in the right direction, but not a giant leap. That left <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/driver/alex-albon/840486/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alex Albon</a> to predict: &#8220;From the initial look at testing, we are the 10th quickest team&#8230; In terms of pure pace, there's a lot of teams out there that make big steps. [Compared to] our direct rivals, possibly <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/team/alphatauri-36471/36471/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AlphaTauri</a> and <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/team/mclaren/36473/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McLaren</a>, I still think we're a little bit behind.&#8221;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>Yet when crunch time came in the reliable Williams, the Thai-Brit achieved something in Bahrain no McLaren or AlphaTauri driver did. He chalked a point in 10th as rookie stablemate <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/driver/logan-sargeant/863323/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Logan Sargeant</a> was only a little adrift in 12th. What&#8217;s more, Albon reckoned even more had been up for grabs had he not qualified &#8220;out of position&#8221; in 15th as a consequence of front wing damage meaning he couldn&#8217;t complete a lap in Q2 to potentially bother the top 10.</p>\n<p>The long run data also suggests Williams is far from a disgrace. Taking an average from their 10 best laps in the race, Sargeant was seventh fastest and Albon 15th. That tallies with their Friday soft-tyre race simulations when Williams was eighth of the 10 outfits. Unsurprisingly, given the slippery nature of the car, the Grove duo were doing much of their heavy lifting at the end of the straights, trading places at the very top of the speed traps.</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><img src=\"//cdn-9.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YBeAJzl2/s8/alex-albon-williams-racing-fw4-1.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Albon, Williams Racing FW45\">\n<p class=\"title\">Alex Albon, Williams Racing FW45</p>\n<p class=\"photographer\">Photo by: Williams</p>\n<p>That drag efficiency should also reveal itself with Williams punching upwards in Saudi Arabia before a potential reality check for the more downforce-dependent trip Down Under. But, for now at least, few metrics have Williams walking away without the wooden spoon.</p>\n<p>A direct comparison with the other 'slow' suspects is hard to come by. Despite <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/driver/lando-norris/840487/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lando Norris</a> and <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/driver/oscar-piastri/869530/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Oscar Piastri</a> being plagued by unreliability and the smorgasbord of penalties that hobbled <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/driver/esteban-ocon/840488/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Esteban Ocon</a>, neither McLaren nor <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/team/alpine/39174/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alpine</a> star towards the very bottom of the times. That leaves <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/team/alfa-romeo/39119/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alfa Romeo</a>, AlphaTauri and Haas to feature alongside Williams. For the duration of the Bahrain GP, however, there is no point where all eight drivers are running with comparable tyres. But there are two windows of considerable overlap.</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>Both Williams, Alfas and Alphas opted to start the race on a brand-spanking new set of soft tyres, while Haas did its own thing. Once the skirmishes of the opening laps were out the way, DRS activated and anomalous lap times put to one side, there was a six-lap crossover period before the first of these six drivers ducked out and hit the pits. At this stage, they were all running with comparable fuel modes and rubber, at least.</p>\n<p>To excuse the inexperience of rookies Sargeant and <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/driver/nyck-de-vries/841508/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nyck de Vries</a> as they adjusted to wheel-to-wheel combat, the fastest driver only from each team is under consideration for the purpose of this comparison. That leaves Albon to front the Williams attack, and he delivered an average lap of 1m40.607s. That&#8217;s a little over 0.2s slower than what <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/driver/valtteri-bottas/829609/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Valtteri Bottas</a> could manage aboard the super-agile Alfa, which sets the standard at low speed compared to its immediate rivals.</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>As such, <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/driver/yuki-tsunoda/841444/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yuki Tsunoda</a> (who qualified a respectable 14th) commenced his third season in the topflight by bringing up the rear aboard the AlphaTauri. The Japanese driver is a fine 0.3s quicker than de Vries but limited in the AT04 to an average lap of 1m40.796s. That initially places the Faenza squad the better part of 0.2s worse off than Williams.</p>\n<p>Some comfort for the sister Red Bull squad could be taken from Tsunoda&#8217;s 10 fastest laps from the grand prix, which ranked a fine seventh overall. However, this flattered to deceive. For this measure, he was helped by running a used set of softs to the flag. He was therefore shod with the quickest compound when the car was running on fumes, so light and rapid.</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>More telling is the window between lap 17 and 24 out of the 57 total. This fell right in the middle of the second stint of the three-stop contest. By this time, Williams had diverged but the Haas, Alfas and Alphas cars had all pitted for a set of new hard tyres that were within four laps old of one another. For the first time, there&#8217;s a clear gauge of where Haas fits in the pecking order.</p>\n<img src=\"//cdn-5.motorsport.com/images/mgl/27vmJ4X0/s8/yuki-tsunoda-alphatauri-at04-1.jpg\" alt=\"Yuki Tsunoda, AlphaTauri AT04\">\n<p class=\"title\">Yuki Tsunoda, AlphaTauri AT04</p>\n<p class=\"photographer\">Photo by: Red Bull Content Pool</p>\n<p>The good news for Gunther Steiner is that his crew fared well. <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/driver/kevin-magnussen/829773/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kevin Magnussen</a> had the legs on the returning <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/driver/nico-hulkenberg/829440/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nico Hulkenberg</a>, so the Dane represents the team when it comes to the average time set over the eight laps in question. He ran to a 1m38.807s on the white-walled Pirellis. That&#8217;s not far short of 0.3s ahead of Alfa pacesetter Bottas, with the VF-23 proving especially rapid down the main straight as it nudges 198mph.</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>And so, bringing up the rear for this particular window is AlphaTauri once again. Tsunoda is in to bat for the second time, as he had the speed over Formula E and FIA F2 champion de Vries. Nevertheless, his average lap was recorded at 1m39.267s - putting AlphaTauri at the back by 0.183s. Seemingly, despite 2023 marking its second attempt, the team has still not adapted to using the larger-scale Red Bull wind tunnel.</p>\n<p>To double underline the plight, this uninspiring pace tallied fully with the race stint simulations during FP2, which were also lacking. In conditions most similar to the race, AlphaTauri was the slowest over a single lap and bringing up the rear when evaluating the pace of the soft tyre as part of a longer 13-lap programme. Taken in isolation, that Friday performance might not have been a disaster, since the team could have been running with a much heavier fuel load. But it's harder to find an excuse over the duration of a full grand prix.</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>The top brass recognises the laboured start. Team principal Franz Tost said: &#8220;From a technical point of view, we have a lot to work on as the car isn&#8217;t on the level I expect. We know where the deficiencies of the car are, and we have to work to increase the performance with new upgrades, which I hope will be effective when they arrive.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Fundamentally, Tsunoda and de Vries reported a lack of grip, much of which stems from another underbaked aero concept. While the Bahrain asphalt is particularly abrasive, cooking the tyres certainly didn't help matters.

            "text": "At the sharp end of the Formula 1 grid, it is crystal clear that Red Bull has stolen an early march at the start of the new season. Delivering on the immense promise shown by the RB19 in testing, Max Verstappen opened the campaign in Bahrain with pole position and an utterly controlled victory. Thanks to stablemate Sergio Perez banking second at both times of asking, the team was just short of a point for fastest lap for a perfect score to kick off the campaign.\n\nFernando Alonso stunned in wheel-to-wheel battle to complete the podium, while Lance Stroll battling through injury to clock sixth proves the Aston Martin AMR23 is a rapid and confidence-inspiring creation. Although there are still questions concerning Ferrari\u2019s tyre degradation and lingering unreliability, plus the Mercedes camp is crestfallen now that its car concept has been brutally exposed, neither are propping up the times.\n\nBut which team has been slowest out of the blocks?\n\nCertainly, Williams was the nailed-on backmarker in 2022 as its first crack at a new-era ground-effects car wanted for downforce and lower-speed cornering balance. This year\u2019s FW45 marked a step in the right direction, but not a giant leap. That left Alex Albon to predict: \u201cFrom the initial look at testing, we are the 10th quickest team\u2026 In terms of pure pace, there's a lot of teams out there that make big steps. [Compared to] our direct rivals, possibly AlphaTauri and McLaren, I still think we're a little bit behind.\u201d\n\nYet when crunch time came in the reliable Williams, the Thai-Brit achieved something in Bahrain no McLaren or AlphaTauri driver did. He chalked a point in 10th as rookie stablemate Logan Sargeant was only a little adrift in 12th. What\u2019s more, Albon reckoned even more had been up for grabs had he not qualified \u201cout of position\u201d in 15th as a consequence of front wing damage meaning he couldn\u2019t complete a lap in Q2 to potentially bother the top 10.\n\nThe long run data also suggests Williams is far from a disgrace. Taking an average from their 10 best laps in the race, Sargeant was seventh fastest and Albon 15th. That tallies with their Friday soft-tyre race simulations when Williams was eighth of the 10 outfits. Unsurprisingly, given the slippery nature of the car, the Grove duo were doing much of their heavy lifting at the end of the straights, trading places at the very top of the speed traps.\n\nAlex Albon, Williams Racing FW45 Photo by: Williams\n\nThat drag efficiency should also reveal itself with Williams punching upwards in Saudi Arabia before a potential reality check for the more downforce-dependent trip Down Under. But, for now at least, few metrics have Williams walking away without the wooden spoon.\n\nA direct comparison with the other 'slow' suspects is hard to come by. Despite Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri being plagued by unreliability and the smorgasbord of penalties that hobbled Esteban Ocon, neither McLaren nor Alpine star towards the very bottom of the times. That leaves Alfa Romeo, AlphaTauri and Haas to feature alongside Williams. For the duration of the Bahrain GP, however, there is no point where all eight drivers are running with comparable tyres. But there are two windows of considerable overlap.\n\nBoth Williams, Alfas and Alphas opted to start the race on a brand-spanking new set of soft tyres, while Haas did its own thing. Once the skirmishes of the opening laps were out the way, DRS activated and anomalous lap times put to one side, there was a six-lap crossover period before the first of these six drivers ducked out and hit the pits. At this stage, they were all running with comparable fuel modes and rubber, at least.\n\nTo excuse the inexperience of rookies Sargeant and Nyck de Vries as they adjusted to wheel-to-wheel combat, the fastest driver only from each team is under consideration for the purpose of this comparison. That leaves Albon to front the Williams attack, and he delivered an average lap of 1m40.607s. That\u2019s a little over 0.2s slower than what Valtteri Bottas could manage aboard the super-agile Alfa, which sets the standard at low speed compared to its immediate rivals.\n\nAs such, Yuki Tsunoda (who qualified a respectable 14th) commenced his third season in the topflight by bringing up the rear aboard the AlphaTauri. The Japanese driver is a fine 0.3s quicker than de Vries but limited in the AT04 to an average lap of 1m40.796s. That initially places the Faenza squad the better part of 0.2s worse off than Williams.\n\nSome comfort for the sister Red Bull squad could be taken from Tsunoda\u2019s 10 fastest laps from the grand prix, which ranked a fine seventh overall. However, this flattered to deceive. For this measure, he was helped by running a used set of softs to the flag. He was therefore shod with the quickest compound when the car was running on fumes, so light and rapid.\n\nMore telling is the window between lap 17 and 24 out of the 57 total. This fell right in the middle of the second stint of the three-stop contest. By this time, Williams had diverged but the Haas, Alfas and Alphas cars had all pitted for a set of new hard tyres that were within four laps old of one another. For the first time, there\u2019s a clear gauge of where Haas fits in the pecking order.\n\nYuki Tsunoda, AlphaTauri AT04 Photo by: Red Bull Content Pool\n\nThe good news for Gunther Steiner is that his crew fared well. Kevin Magnussen had the legs on the returning Nico Hulkenberg, so the Dane represents the team when it comes to the average time set over the eight laps in question. He ran to a 1m38.807s on the white-walled Pirellis. That\u2019s not far short of 0.3s ahead of Alfa pacesetter Bottas, with the VF-23 proving especially rapid down the main straight as it nudges 198mph.\n\nAnd so, bringing up the rear for this particular window is AlphaTauri once again. Tsunoda is in to bat for the second time, as he had the speed over Formula E and FIA F2 champion de Vries. Nevertheless, his average lap was recorded at 1m39.267s - putting AlphaTauri at the back by 0.183s. Seemingly, despite 2023 marking its second attempt, the team has still not adapted to using the larger-scale Red Bull wind tunnel.\n\nTo double underline the plight, this uninspiring pace tallied fully with the race stint simulations during FP2, which were also lacking. In conditions most similar to the race, AlphaTauri was the slowest over a single lap and bringing up the rear when evaluating the pace of the soft tyre as part of a longer 13-lap programme. Taken in isolation, that Friday performance might not have been a disaster, since the team could have been running with a much heavier fuel load. But it's harder to find an excuse over the duration of a full grand prix.\n\nThe top brass recognises the laboured start. Team principal Franz Tost said: \u201cFrom a technical point of view, we have a lot to work on as the car isn\u2019t on the level I expect. We know where the deficiencies of the car are, and we have to work to increase the performance with new upgrades, which I hope will be effective when they arrive.\u201d\n\nFundamentally, Tsunoda and de Vries reported a lack of grip, much of which stems from another underbaked aero concept. While the Bahrain asphalt is particularly abrasive, cooking the tyres certainly didn't help matters. High-speed performance is also a weak spot, which suggests a visit to the flowing Jeddah street circuit in Saudi won\u2019t lift AlphaTauri too much higher. In fact, compared to the Williams, Alfa and Haas, it\u2019s only really under low-speed acceleration where the AT04 comes up trumps, and that's thanks to the Honda engine.\n\nLando Norris, McLaren MCL60, Esteban Ocon, Alpine A523, Alex Albon, Williams FW45, Yuki Tsunoda, AlphaTauri AT04, the remainder of the field at the start Photo by: Zak Mauger / Motorsport Images",

Mick Schumacher was named as successor following his departure from Haas.\n\nReserve driver: Jack Doohan\n\nBehind the scenes, top talent Oscar Piastri had been groomed by Alpine in recent years for a future as a regular driver. However, the Australian wasn't confident about the future and decided to sign a contract with McLaren. Jack Doohan has been named as the team's reserve driver for 2023, a role he will dovetail with a Formula 2 campaign.\n\nAlphaTauri\n\nDue to its close ties with Red Bull, AlphaTauri doesn't have a reserve driver of its own. The small team from Faenza can call on the big brother's pool instead. Promising youngsters from the Red Bull training programme are also given the opportunity to gain mileage at AlphaTauri.\n\nAlex Albon, Williams FW45 Photo by: Williams F1\n\nThe legendary Grove-based team had Logan Sargeant as a test driver in 2022. However, the young American will be promoted to the second race seat alongside Alexander Albon for 2023. Williams does not employ its own reserve driver. In recent years, they've been able to call on the reserves of engine partner Mercedes when necessary. Whether that will also be the case in 2023 is not yet known.\n\nHaas\n\nReserve driver: Pietro Fittipaldi\n\nPietro Fittipaldi has filled the role of reserve driver at Haas for the past three seasons. At the Brazilian Grand Prix, team boss Gunther Steiner revealed that a continuation of the partnership would be possible if it fits within Fittipaldi's racing plans, which has since been confirmed.",

The Australian came through the turmoil that blighted his &#8217;22 season and proved his speed hadn&#8217;t diminished in the slightest.

Ayumu Iwasa Age: 22 Nationality: Japanese 2023 plans: FIA Formula 2 with DAMS Building on an impressive first year in FIA Formula 2, Ayumu Iwasa showed in 2022 why he is such an exciting prospect and knocking on the door of F1 opportunity. The 22-year-old capped off the year with a brilliantly measured drive to hold off F2 champion Felipe Drugovich for victory at Yas Marina, combining his speed with astute defensive driving.

Using the early rounds to find his way again in F2, the Brazilian shone on several occasions in 2022, earning multiple podiums along the way. His efforts have earned him a spot on the Red Bull Junior driver roster, and there\u2019s no reason to think he can\u2019t go even better in 2023.

The Frenchman had the vital ingredient that his closest rivals lacked: a calmness amongst the unpredictability. His maturity proved pivotal, as he kept his cool in a nail-biting finale at Monza to secure the championship and has his sights on even bigger things in 2023, having confirmed he'll be racing in F2 with the ART team.

Taking pole on his debut in Bahrain, Colapinto went on to secure two wins in his first season. A switch to MP Motorsport for 2023 should provide him with the tools to go even better this year and make a push towards being a title contender.

Winner of karting championships in Sweden and Italy, he was snapped up by the Ferrari Driver Academy in 2020. In 2023, Beganovic will tackle FIA Formula 3 with PREMA Racing, and arrives fresh from his finest season in single seaters yet.\n\nBeganovic has been a member of the Ferrari Driver Academy since 2020\n\nAbbi Pulling Age: 19 Nationality: British 2023 plans: TBC Following a switch from British F4 to W Series, Abbi Pulling has made tangible progress. She was signed up by Alpine to its Affiliates programme, intended to provide a route to the team\u2019s Academy in the longer term. Taking part in an FIA F3 test last year at Magny-Cours and still just 19, she remains one of the brightest female talents and strongest prospects in single seaters.

The 18-year-old was a strong contender for the 2022 F3 crown until late-season heartbreak in the finale at Monza ended his hopes. With plenty of speed in combination with daring overtaking prowess, there\u2019s always tangible excitement when watching Hadjar race \u2013 and in 2023 he'll be doing so in Formula 2 this year, making the step up with the Hitech team.\n\nHadjar was a contender for the F3 title in 2022\n\nOliver Bearman Age: 17 Nationality: British 2023 plans: FIA Formula 2 with PREMA Racing Oliver Bearman will gear up to take on FIA Formula 2 this year with PREMA Racing. After becoming the first driver to secure the Italian and German F4 crowns in the same year, he jumped up to FIA F3 and made the leap look easy. He has maturity, consistency and daring in equal measure, a combination that guided him to third in his rookie F3 year, just seven points from the title.

His one-lap pace was evidenced with an against-the-odds home pole at Silverstone, while his risk-taking earned him a memorable P4 finish in a wet-to-dry Budapest Feature Race. He enters the 2023 F3 season as one of the favourites for the title. READ MORE: British teen racer Zak O'Sullivan joins Williams Driver Academy\n\nWilliams-backed O'Sullivan is one of the favourites for the F3 title this season\n\nGabriele Mini Age: 17 Nationality: Italian 2023 plans: FIA Formula 3 with Hitech Grand Prix An immense karting talent in Italy and on the CIK-FIA stage, Gabriele Mini has been one of the most successful Italian drivers in recent seasons. Taking the Italian F4 title in his first year of racing cars in 2020, he moved to the Formula Regional European Championship by Alpine, and after one year of bedding in, finished as runner-up in 2022. Still 17, Mini will tackle FIA F3 this year with Hitech Grand Prix.\n\nMini will drive for Hitech Grand Prix in F3 this season\n\nSebastian Montoya Age: 17 Nationality: Colombian 2023 plans: FIA Formula 3 with Hitech Grand Prix Yes, the same Montoya family you\u2019re thinking of, Sebastian has been making progress in recent years in the junior formulas around the world. Fourth in Italian F4 back in 2021, Montoya made a one-off appearance at Zandvoort in FIA F3 with Campos Racing last season. He scored points in both races and never looked out of place, fighting tooth-and-nail with eventual Champion, Victor Martins. Can the newly-announced Red Bull Junior follow up those performances in 2023? READ MORE: Juan Pablo Montoya\u2019s son Sebastian joins Red Bull Junior Team and sets \u2018ultimate goal\u2019 of F1\n\nNewly-announced Red Bull Junior driver Montoya made a one-off appearance in F3 last season\n\nAndrea Kimi Antonelli Age: 16 Nationality: Italian 2023 plans: Formula Regional European Championship by Alpine with PREMA Racing Arguably the jewel in the Mercedes Junior Team crown, Andrea Kimi Antonelli\u2019s list of achievements is staggering for a 16-year-old. Twice a CIK-FIA European Karting champion, he followed that up by becoming the second driver to win the German and Italian F4 titles in the same season in his first full campaign in cars. This year he will race in Formula Regional European Championship by Alpine with PREMA Racing. Keep an eye on Antonelli in 2023.

This year, he\u2019s set for a full season in Italian F4 with PREMA Racing and possesses plenty of potential.

He finished the year fourth in the standings, before winning both F4 UAE Trophy Races on the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix support bill in November, beating 2022 British F4 Champion Alex Dunne in the process. He will remain with Carlin this season for a second campaign in British F4.\n\nSharp will be racing with Carlin for a second season in British F4.\n\nEnzo Tarnvanichkul Age: 13 Nationality: Thai 2023 plans: TBC Thailand\u2019s second FIA Karting champion and Red Bull\u2019s youngest ever signing to its Junior Team programme, Enzo Tarnvanichkul is just getting started. He won the CIK-FIA Junior karting title last year and was snapped up by the F1 champions ahead of 2023, receiving his championship trophy at the FIA Gala from Max Verstappen.

That offer was accepted by Williams.\"\n\nAccording to the FIA, Williams also agreed to remediate the procedural breach by no later than 31 May 2022, and to \"bear the costs incurred by the Cost Cap Administration in connection with the preparation of the ABA\".\n\n\"The decision of the Cost Cap Administration to enter into the above-mentioned ABA constitutes its final decision resolving the matter and is not subject to appeal,\" the statement added.\n\n\"Non-compliance by Williams with any terms of the ABA will result in a further Procedural Breach under Articles 6.30 and 8.2(f) of the Financial Regulations and automatic referral to the Cost Cap Adjudication Panel.\n\n\"The Cost Cap Administration confirms that, as of the date hereof, Williams has within the specified deadline remediated the Procedural Breach, paid the Financial Penalty, and bore the costs incurred by the Cost Cap Administration in connection with the preparation of the ABA.\"\n\nAlex Albon, Williams FW44 Photo by: Mark Sutton / Motorsport Images\n\nThe current budget cap introduced in 2022 is $140m for the year, with an extra $1.2m for a 22nd race.\n\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner said last month his team could be forced to miss some races unless the cap is adjusted to match inflation levels.\n\nF1 teams have yet to agree on a direction for addressing the inflation, with several of the smaller teams arguing that it would set a bad precedent to revise the cap.\n\nFerrari's Mattia Binotto warned there was way his team would be able to fall under the cap, but was unclear on what the consequence would be as there is no fixed penalty for what is known as a \u2018minor\u2019 breach of the rules within 5% percent of the limit.\n\nHorner said: \"I think all the major teams are going to breach that $140m cap this year. But what is the penalty for a minor breach?\n\n\"What we don't want to do is end up is playing a game of chicken as to say, do you go for 4.9 per cent over, do we go for 4.7%? And that could be one upgrade: that could be the differentiating factor of this world championship.\n\n\"I think what we do need is clarity and clarity quickly.\"",
