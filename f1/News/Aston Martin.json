Is there really any fire behind Charles Leclerc's second-place finish to Red Bull Racing's Max Verstappen at the Austrian Grand Prix, or is it just smoke and mirrors, with Carlos Sainz Jr.'s run to sixth at the Red Bull Ring the true measure? Somewhere between all that is the truth, as through two practices for the British Grand Prix at Silverstone on Friday it was Sainz who was pushing Verstappen at the top of the time charts while Leclerc sat in the garage through the second practice, his pit crew searching for a troubling electrical issue on his Ferrari before eventually giving up to change their focus to Saturday's qualifying.</p><p>The early betting line had Leclerc tied with Fernando Alonso as the fourth favorite behind Verstappen, Sergio Perez in the second Red Bull, and Lewis Hamilton.

Is there really any fire behind Charles Leclerc's second-place finish to Red Bull Racing's Max Verstappen at the Austrian Grand Prix, or is it just smoke and mirrors, with Carlos Sainz Jr.'s run to sixth at the Red Bull Ring the true measure? Somewhere between all that is the truth, as through two practices for the British Grand Prix at Silverstone on Friday it was Sainz who was pushing Verstappen at the top of the time charts while Leclerc sat in the garage through the second practice, his pit crew searching for a troubling electrical issue on his Ferrari before eventually giving up to change their focus to Saturday's qualifying.\n\nThe early betting line had Leclerc tied with Fernando Alonso as the fourth favorite behind Verstappen, Sergio Perez in the second Red Bull, and Lewis Hamilton.

            "title": "What the teams said \u2013 Qualifying in Great Britain",
            "article_html": "<div><h3>Red Bull</h3>\n<p>It was a mixed day at Red Bull, for while Max Verstappen charged to yet another pole position &#8211; his fifth in a row and seventh of the season so far &#8211; team mate Sergio Perez dropped out in Q1 to continue his painful qualifying run. The Mexican later gained a position after Valtteri Bottas was disqualified. It means Verstappen is likely to be fighting the McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri by himself during Sunday&#8217;s Grand Prix.</p>\n<p><strong>Max Verstappen, 1st, 1:26.720</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was quite a crazy qualifying, very hectic and slippery in some places. I had a little &#8216;inchident&#8217; in the pit lane, I understeered as I turned and the car just went straight - I think there was quite a bit of damage. That aside, very happy. Equally, I&#8217;m very happy for McLaren, you could see how excited everyone was in that garage, they&#8217;ve worked so hard, it&#8217;s also great for the British fans too.\nI&#8217;m expecting the Ferraris and Mercedes to be more competitive during the race. As for us, we know that we have a good race car and I&#8217;m already looking forward to it. I don&#8217;t mind if it&#8217;s wet tomorrow, in FP3 we were very fast in the wet so I don&#8217;t think we need to worry.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Sergio Perez, 15th, 1:29.968</strong></p>\n<p>\"Today was quite disappointing. The red flag lasted a lot longer than we initially thought it would so we lost some heat on the tyres and couldn&#8217;t get enough temperature back into them. We also struggled with the weather. The changing conditions made things a lot trickier, so we ended up having a poor qualifying. We had a good session yesterday so, for now, we need to look forward to tomorrow and just aim to get any many points as possible. It&#8217;s going to be difficult to come through the field but we will try our very best.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Christian Horner, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>\"A mixed bag from qualifying today. The weather was about as British as it gets; raining while sunny. This complicated things for us slightly but it looks like the race will be dryer so we won&#8217;t have to flip flop between inters and slicks as we have done today. The change in conditions means we won&#8217;t be able to take a lot of the data from practice with us but we will certainly take the pole from qualifying.</p>\n<p>\"It was another great performance from Max, his 5th pole in a row. Conversely, another tough quali for Checo but remaining confident for a good run tomorrow with plenty to race for.\"</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"NORTHAMPTON, ENGLAND - JULY 08: Pole position qualifier Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        Pole went to Verstappen and Red Bull in a wet-dry qualifying at Silverstone\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <h3>Mercedes</h3>\n<p>Mercedes had a quiet start to their British Grand Prix weekend, and while qualifying brought an improvement, George Russell and Lewis Hamilton (after a wild spin in Q1) had to settle for sixth and seventh on the grid. Starting just behind the Ferraris, there could be quite a battle between the red and black cars on race day.</p>\n<p><strong>Lewis Hamilton, 7th, 1:27.211</strong></p>\n<p>\"We weren&#8217;t quite quick enough today unfortunately. The conditions were tricky out there but there was still an element of fun to it, as we tried to get on top of the tyres. There were some moments where it looked like we had the potential to challenge further forward, but then we fell back a little. We seem to struggle on the single lap more than we do on the race pace, so we will see what we can do tomorrow. If we can progress forward, then that would be amazing. Hopefully we can put some pressure on the cars ahead and get into a battle with them.\"</p>\n<p><strong>George Russell, 6th, 1:27.155</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was an exciting session; I really enjoy these conditions. I&#8217;m always confident that I can do a good job and put the laps in when needed. It was stressful at times, but I felt comfortable with our pace in Q1 and Q2. My last lap in Q3 was strong, but it was frustrating to see how close we were to being a couple of positions further forward. I was a little bit disappointed not to achieve this but we&#8217;re in a decent place for tomorrow. The Team did a good job of improving the car overnight and I&#8217;m excited to see what we can do in the Grand Prix. We believe we have stronger race pace than on the single lap, so I&#8217;m confident that we can move forward.</p>\n<p>\"Once again, the energy from the fans today has been amazing. You really feel the support from the stands and it&#8217;s incredible to see how they are backing the Team and us as drivers. It&#8217;s a special weekend and we can hopefully do a good job tomorrow and challenge for the podium.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Toto Wolff, Team Principal and CEO</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was an interesting session today, with the gap between P2 and P7 only a few tenths. We were more competitive than we thought we might be in terms of lap time, and the gap to the front-row is small. That is not an excuse though and P6 and P7 are the positions we are in. The question for us now is how much pace differential you need in order to overtake. There are several cars ahead of us but we&#8217;re hopeful we can make some good progress.</p>\n<p>\"Whilst it&#8217;s frustrating in one sense, it's also encouraging to see the lap time gains that others have found, including McLaren recently. It&#8217;s a good example of how you can add performance during the season. We&#8217;ve been able to do so ourselves and we&#8217;re focused on continuing to do that. This will help us compete on both Saturday and Sunday, and ultimately close the gap to the front.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director</strong></p>\n<p>\"Qualifying wasn&#8217;t an easy session; there were a few bands of rain coming through that kept us on our toes. In those conditions, it&#8217;s easy to get a car knocked out along the way but we have both well in the top 10. It&#8217;s frustrating to be on the wrong side of a tight bunch today, but the gap to pole is a big improvement on Friday.</p>\n<p>\"Our long run pace looked good yesterday, so we&#8217;re hoping to be able to push forward. We also haven&#8217;t made any changes to the car that should hurt that race pace. We&#8217;d prefer to be starting further up as it would certainly help our chances of getting on the podium, but there are still opportunities on strategy that will allow us to offset. Whether McLaren have the race pace to match their qualifying speed will influence the strategy significantly. It&#8217;s going to be an interesting Grand Prix as there could be plenty of cars in the battle for the podium.\"</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"NORTHAMPTON, ENGLAND - JULY 08: George Russell of Great Britain driving the (63) Mercedes AMG\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        Mercedes finished behind Verstappen&#8217;s Red Bull, the McLarens and the Ferraris\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <h3>Aston Martin</h3>\n<p>After dropping down the order in Austria, it was more of the same for Aston Martin during qualifying at Silverstone, with Fernando Alonso making it through to Q3 and placing ninth, while Lance Stroll dropped out in Q2 en route to 12th, having been involved in a squabble for track position with Alpine rival Esteban Ocon.</p>\n<p><strong>Fernando Alonso, 9th, 1:27.659</strong></p>\n<p>\"It's not the Qualifying we wanted in what was a challenging session in drying conditions. There is still a long race ahead of us tomorrow and our Sunday pace is normally a strong point of this car.</p>\n<p>\"We still achieved another Q3 result, but we need to keep understanding our car at different circuits. The weather tomorrow may also be changeable, as it was today, so we need to remain focused and see what we can do in race conditions.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Lance Stroll, 12th, 1:28.935</strong></p>\n<p>\"I think more was possible in Qualifying today. The red flag forced us to run a third set of tyres in Q1, which meant we didn&#8217;t have a new set in Q2 and that put us on the back foot in comparison to others.</p>\n<p>\"It's a long race tomorrow and the AMR23 is feeling good, so I'll be doing my best to fight through the pack and put on a good show for the home fans.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Mike Krack, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>\"One of the most challenging Qualifying sessions of the year so far with a drying track, the constant threat of rain, and a red flag just before the end of Q1.</p>\n<p>\"Overall we missed the absolute pace to be fighting for the top positions today so we need to review things, understand where we can find more performance, and take those learnings going forward. We will try to come back stronger tomorrow in front of the passionate British fans who will be out in force.\"</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"NORTHAMPTON, ENGLAND - JULY 08: Fernando Alonso of Spain driving the (14) Aston Martin AMR23\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        Alonso led the Aston Martin charge but could do no more than ninth\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <h3>Ferrari</h3>\n<p>Ferrari ended the first day of practice hot on the heels of Red Bull, with Carlos Sainz only marginally slower than Max Verstappen. But the mixed qualifying session yielded only fourth and fifth, with McLaren pair Norris and Piastri making the most of the tricky conditions to slot ahead of the SF-23s &#8211; Charles Leclerc bouncing back from missing FP2 with a technical problem to edge out Sainz.</p>\n<p><strong>Charles Leclerc, 4th, 1:27.136</strong></p>\n<p>\"A pretty good qualifying, considering that I struggled a bit in the last few races in mixed conditions on slick tyres. I felt good today, because it seems that the hard work I&#8217;ve put in to improve this has paid off. I didn&#8217;t put the perfect lap together in Q3 as I lost grip in turn 15, so a front row position was not possible today.</p>\n<p>\"It&#8217;s nice to see McLaren be so quick and I expect an exciting race tomorrow with all of us so close together. We don&#8217;t have any race trim data on my side because I missed out on FP2, but we maximised every session since then and are in a decent starting position, so everything is possible tomorrow.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Carlos Sainz, 5th, 1:27.148</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was not a bad Saturday overall after a very challenging Quali. The field was very tight and the conditions were changing all the time, so to produce a solid session like we did was not easy.</p>\n<p>\"Tomorrow we can expect a nice battle with the cars around us so I expect an intense race. We&#8217;ll give absolutely everything to bring home a good result.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Vasseur, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>\"All three parts of qualifying were very exciting for the fans and spectators. It was good for Formula 1, good for the show. For our part, it was a bit so-so, even if we are in front of our direct competitors. But there was room to do better as Charles made a slight mistake in turn 15 which affected his lap time. What is important is that we are not far off the pace.</p>\n<p>\"We are still trying to be more consistent with regard to tyre degradation and we saw at the last two races, at very different tracks, that we have made a good step with this. Silverstone is a more demanding circuit in this regard and on paper, it did not look as though it would suit us, but we have been competitive and we can try and move up the order tomorrow. It&#8217;s hard to know what to expect from the weather: it changes every hour and the race lasts two hours! But we are very motivated.\"</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"NORTHAMPTON, ENGLAND - JULY 08: Sparks fly behind Charles Leclerc of Monaco driving the (16)\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        Leclerc finished ahead of Sainz despite missing FP2 with technical trouble\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <h3>Alpine</h3>\n<p>Like Aston Martin, Alpine got one car into Q3 and saw the other eliminated in Q2. With Ocon hindered by that aforementioned incident involving the green machine of Stroll, it was Pierre Gasly who finished as the fastest of the Enstone drivers, rounding out the top 10 in the pole position shootout.</p>\n<p><strong>Esteban Ocon, 13th, 1:28.956</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a frustrating day and a missed opportunity for us in Qualifying. It&#8217;s always disappointing not to make Q3, especially as we had the pace to do so. The conditions were not easy but we had been managing it very well. In Q2, it was not an ideal start to my final push lap as I braked on the wet side of the track alongside Lance [Stroll] and then spent my lap behind Charles [Leclerc], which cost us time. There are plenty of things for us to review from today, however, I&#8217;m feeling ready to make up some ground in tomorrow&#8217;s race.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Pierre Gasly, 10th, 1:27.689</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;That was a very challenging Qualifying to manage with the varying conditions. That said, when it is like that it&#8217;s often very exciting on-track and it certainly was enjoyable at the wheel. While I&#8217;m pleased to be in Q3 again, I&#8217;m disappointed we weren&#8217;t able to qualify any higher up than tenth place. We know the areas where we are lacking performance and we have to keep pushing hard as a team to find improvements to our package. Tomorrow, we will give it our all. The start of the race is going to be critical to make up some places and I&#8217;m confident we can come away with points on the board.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Alan Permane, Sporting Director</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all disappointed with today&#8217;s Qualifying performance as the minimum target, as always for us, is to have both cars well inside Q3. The weather and conditions proved tricky and it was all about being on track at the right time. We managed that well on both sides of the garage to advance through Q1 where all drivers found significant lap time improvement after the first red flag. Esteban did not progress further than Q2 while Pierre was able to reach Q3. There was probably a small amount of lap time left on the table for Pierre in a very tight session. We have a lot of work ahead of us if we&#8217;re to have both cars inside the top ten tomorrow. It&#8217;s usually a long, tough race here and we have every confidence that we can have a strong afternoon.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"NORTHAMPTON, ENGLAND - JULY 07: Pierre Gasly of Alpine and France  during practice ahead of the F1\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        Alpine were on the fringes of the top 10 positions during qualifying\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <h3>McLaren</h3>\n<p>After a tough start to the season, McLaren appeared to take a significant step forward with major updates on Lando Norris&#8217; car in Austria. With the new parts fitted to both the Briton and Oscar Piastri&#8217;s chrome-liveried machines this weekend at Silverstone, they doubled down on that performance with a stunning run to second and third in qualifying, launching into contention in the mixed conditions that they have excelled in in recent times.</p>\n<p><strong>Lando Norris, 2nd, 1:26.961</strong></p>\n<p>\"That was close! Two-tenths to P1 in Q3, is pretty insane. My last lap was a good lap. I could hear Zak on the radio on the in-lap, which is the best thing ever. I&#8217;m grateful. For us to achieve second and third is pretty amazing for the whole team, with all the hard work that we've been putting in, especially to do it here in Silverstone. To do that with the chrome livery at our home race, for the team, for myself, is amazing. Big thanks to the whole crowd here, they&#8217;re amazing. It's been a very special day for us. I look forward to tomorrow.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Oscar Piastri, 3rd, 1:27.092</strong></p>\n<p>\"I&#8217;m very, very, very happy. I mean, what a qualifying session. The car was a rocket ship in Q2 and Q3, I feel like I put a pretty good lap together. It&#8217;s a massive result for the team and the hard work that&#8217;s gone into bringing upgrades to the car. To have both of us up here is a mega result. Now we've just got to try and stay there for tomorrow. We know that will be a challenge, but we&#8217;re looking forward to it.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Andrea Stella, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>\"It&#8217;s great to see two McLarens up towards the top of the qualifying standings here at Silverstone. P2 and P3 has been achieved in tricky conditions today: the team had to be switched-on to get us through the first two sessions. We could then capitalise on that with strong laps from Lando and Oscar in Q3. A big positive is that we could confirm the progress we saw in Austria and the further upgrades we brought here. For that, I have to thank everyone at the factory and here trackside for their hard work, commitment and dedication. We have an incredible team, and we should enjoy today and use this as extra motivation going forward. We now focus on preparing for the race and look forward to tomorrow. We are realistic for the race as we know we have quick cars around us, but we will give our best in tomorrow&#8217;s British Grand Prix.\"</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"NORTHAMPTON, ENGLAND - JULY 08: Second placed qualifier Lando Norris of Great Britain and McLaren\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        It was a brilliant day at Silverstone for McLaren duo Norris and Piastri\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <h3>Haas</h3>\n<p>Haas came close to getting a car into Q3 with Nico Hulkenberg&#8217;s run to 11th, but that was the limit for the team on an otherwise challenging day. Indeed, Kevin Magnussen wound up 20th and last after his VF-23 ground to a halt and brought out the red flags in Q1, leaving him with a lonely walk back to the pits. He will start 19th thanks to Bottas' disqualification.</p>\n<p><strong>Nico Hulkenberg, 11th, 1:28.896</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was tricky obviously with the damp and wet patches, it&#8217;s quite sketchy, and it can go wrong but it didn&#8217;t. I think it was a good qualifying and I feel like I squeezed everything out of it. It was close with Alpine but not having DRS actually hurt us quite a bit. I think we&#8217;re a bit more &#8216;draggy&#8217; and have more downforce than other cars, so missing DRS wasn&#8217;t ideal for us.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Magnussen, 19th, 1:32.378</strong></p>\n<p>\"It just doesn&#8217;t seem to be my year this one so far, but this is where you show experience, stay cool and keep fighting. Everything switched off in the car, I had no power steering, nothing, I don&#8217;t know what it was in Q1. Until that point it felt good compared to the rest of the weekend, I was on a decent lap to improve there &#8211; on the one I stopped. There was still time on the clock so I don&#8217;t know if that would have been the last one.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Guenther Steiner, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>\"Due to the changing conditions, it was very difficult to read into FP3. We did what we wanted to do but we took no conclusions from it because of the variable conditions, between the weather, track surface, and everything else. We knew that though and we tried a few things, and they went well. We just missed out on Q3 in qualifying, just by a bit, as Nico was very close behind a car in the very fast sector and obviously that&#8217;s not good, especially with our car. With Kevin, we had an issue with the oil system, we lost all the oil, but hopefully the engine isn&#8217;t damaged.\"</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"NORTHAMPTON, ENGLAND - JULY 08: Kevin Magnussen of Denmark and Haas F1 climbs from his car after\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        Magnussen triggered a red flag when he stopped out on track in Q1\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <h3>Alfa Romeo</h3>\n<p>Alfa Romeo pair Valtteri Bottas and Zhou Guanyu were encouraged by the early signs from the upgrade package the team unleashed this weekend, but they had little to celebrate after qualifying. Bottas placed 11th in Q1, but could not participate in Q2 after he parked up at the side of the track, leaving him 15th. He was later disqualified from qualified after his car couldn't provide a fuel sample, leaving him 20th. Zhou, meanwhile, could do no more than 18th on the damp track surface but was elevated a position thanks to his team mate's disqualification.</p>\n<p><strong>Valtteri Bottas, 20th, 1:29.798</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s results are very disappointing, as it seemed we actually had a real chance to make it into the top ten. I started to lose power on the final inlap, and then the engine stopped. We eventually figured out it was a technical issue with fuel in the car, and we are already working to address that and make sure it doesn&#8217;t happen again. Sadly, this means we&#8217;ll be starting at the back of the grid in the race, which is not where we would have deserved to be looking at our pace. Still, tomorrow will be a long day and, as always, the weather could add one more element of unpredictability: the car felt better than yesterday, and we have slightly better pace compared to previous events, so our aim will be to make the most out of it and fight as hard as we can through the field.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Zhou Guanyu, 17th, 1:30.123</strong></p>\n<p>\"I think we had the potential to improve our performance this weekend, but unfortunately, today has been quite tricky for our team and we couldn&#8217;t maximise our chances. I had no running time during the final practice session because of a technical issue that the team promptly investigated and addressed, allowing me to get back on track ahead of qualifying. There, too, my running chances were limited, and I struggled with finding enough grip, eventually getting only one timed lap which wasn&#8217;t enough to make it through to Q2. We are of course disappointed not to have had an actual shot at moving forward, but our main aim now will be to regroup and come prepared ahead of tomorrow.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Alessandro Alunni Bravi, Team Representative</strong></p>\n<p>\"We are undoubtedly disappointed, as we felt more than on previous days that we had the potential to do well. With Valtteri we showed we were comfortably into Q2, but a technical issue related to fuel forced him to stop, and to pull out of qualifying. Unfortunately, the problem meant we weren&#8217;t able to submit the required fuel sample to the scrutineers, which lead to Valtteri being disqualified from the session. It&#8217;s a pity as he had been doing an excellent job, and we are sorry to see his chances of a good qualifying session seriously damaged. For Zhou, it has been more difficult: he completely sat out of FP3 because of a car issue, and then wasn&#8217;t able to move into Q2. It is in moments like these that the team needs to regroup and stick together, and push each other to further improve; we must aim to execute a better weekend. Tomorrow will be challenging, but we are not letting our heads down after today&#8217;s result: we&#8217;ll be ready to do our job, and carry out a good race to allow us to recover the ground we have lost.\"</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"NORTHAMPTON, ENGLAND - JULY 08: Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        Bottas was another to suffer a qualifying stoppage, parking up at the side of the track in Q2\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <h3>Williams</h3>\n<p>Williams showed plenty of promise on Friday and, while they moved to play down their expectations, Alex Albon converted it to take a fine eighth in qualifying &#8211; surviving an early scare in Q1 when the conditions were at their most precarious. Logan Sargeant could not join him in Q3 after seeing two of his lap times deleted during the Q2 phase for exceeding track limits.</p>\n<p><strong>Logan Sargeant, 14th, 1:29.031</strong></p>\n<p>\"For me, the first goal of this weekend was to get into Q2, and I achieved that. It was a tricky session all in all. We can&#8217;t catch a break from mixed conditions at the moment. We knew it was going to be a lot closer coming into qualifying than we saw in practice. It&#8217;s a shame that I didn&#8217;t have a new set of tyres at the end of Q2 as I think that probably cost us the chance of transferring to Q3. At the end of the day, the car was in a good place and we&#8217;re making steps in the right direction. I&#8217;m happy with the steps that I&#8217;m making this weekend. I still have plenty of steps to take which is clear to me. As long as I&#8217;m moving in the right direction that&#8217;s the positive part and we can build off that to have a good race tomorrow. It won&#8217;t be easy starting 14th with a lot of quick cars around us but we&#8217;ll do our best.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Alex Albon, 8th, 1:27.530</strong></p>\n<p>\"It&#8217;s been an amazing weekend but it&#8217;s funny when you finish in Q3, with P8 and you&#8217;re disappointed.We have to be realistic but it&#8217;s been great so far. In Qualifying, the session was going quite smoothly but, as the track dried out, corner speeds picked up and track evolution came in. We started to get quite a bit of degradation through the lap, even front deg, so we need to go away and understand that but, by the time I got to Q3, I was struggling a little bit with those combined factors. We&#8217;ve been really on top of it since the start of the weekend and I got into rhythm very quickly and adapted well to the changes, so we really hit the ground running. I think we ended up where we expected to be but I think if you told us we&#8217;d be here at the beginning of the weekend, we wouldn&#8217;t believe you.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Dave Robson, Head of Vehicle Performance</strong></p>\n<p>\"Today was exceptionally difficult with mixed and varying conditions throughout the day. We timed the run on Soft tyres well in FP3; whilst this allowed us to learn quite a lot about the car, it gave us a position on the timesheet that flattered our true pace. However, both drivers were still happy with the car balance and comfortable going into qualifying.</p>\n<p>\"Qualifying was a rollercoaster with both Alex and Logan struggling to get a representative lap done around the showers in Q1. The red flag allowed us to reset and both showed excellent pace and composure to deliver very good laps under pressure. Q2 was much calmer for Alex and he was very quick in comfortably making Q3. Logan found the conditions a little more difficult and had to do his final lap on a more used set from Q1, which cost him the couple of tenths that he needed to progress. Alex was very strong on the used Soft at the beginning of Q3 but couldn&#8217;t quite find the final bit of grip as the track dried. Nonetheless, it was a potentially very difficult qualifying session and we dealt with it well and have both cars in a useful position for the Grand Prix tomorrow as a result.\"</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"NORTHAMPTON, ENGLAND - JULY 08: Alexander Albon of Thailand and Williams prepares to drive in the\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        Albon gave the home fans even more to cheer about with his qualifying display\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <h3>AlphaTauri</h3>\n<p>AlphaTauri were the only team to lose both cars in Q1 at Silverstone, with Yuki Tsunoda winding up 17th and Nyck de Vries placing 19th, ahead of only the sidelined Magnussen. Both moved up a place thanks to Bottas' disqualification but it leaves the Italian team &#8211; now last in the constructors&#8217; standings &#8211; with plenty of work to do if they are to claim points on Sunday.</p>\n<p><strong>Nyck de Vries, 18th, 1:30.513</strong></p>\n<p>\"I ended up very close to Q2 again, it&#8217;s frustrating and a shame, but I&#8217;m happy with my performance. Track evolution was high and almost fully dry in the end, but the team did a good job with the strategy. We tried many different things with the new upgrade, and compared to yesterday, the car felt better. I feel more support in the places I need, especially in the low-speed corners, and more rotation in the high-speed corners, which we were aiming for. There is room for improvement, but we&#8217;re still trying to understand the car&#8217;s behaviour more. I reset myself and do whatever I can tomorrow to extract as much performance from the car and finish as high as possible.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Yuki Tsunoda, 16th, 1:30.025</strong></p>\n<p>\"Today&#8217;s qualifying was a very tricky session, with changing conditions as the rain was coming. We did a decent lap at the beginning of qualifying, but towards the end, when it became a one-lap shootout, my tyres were very cold. I didn&#8217;t have the confidence and temperature to push and attack as required, making a mistake in the last corner where I out braked myself and went deep, losing a lot of time there. During the session, we were more competitive and in the mix, so I feel our final lap wasn&#8217;t entirely representative. In these changing conditions, we maybe didn&#8217;t put it together when it mattered. We did some long runs in practice, but it&#8217;s certainly not going to be easy tomorrow. A big part of the track is high-speed, so it&#8217;s difficult to overtake and follow, so a little rain is welcome because it might bring some opportunities.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Jonathan Eddolls, Chief Race Engineer</strong></p>\n<p>\"The run programme for both cars in Q1 was smooth, with the right tyres fitted, the right sequence of push and cool laps being adopted, and the timing to box for a new set sensible. However, the red flag disrupted things and unfortunately, the final runs were not good enough. Frustratingly, Yuki was very close to making the cut for Q2, but due to a snap during brake entry, he lost a little time during turn 16. Nyck was further away with his final run, so we need to look into the data to understand what happened. Our starting positions make things more difficult for the race, but we&#8217;ll be fully focused on being ready to take any opportunities which allow us to move forwards with both cars tomorrow.\"</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"NORTHAMPTON, ENGLAND - JULY 08: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        AlphaTauri suffered a double Q1 exit with Tsunoda and De Vries\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <h3>Pirelli</h3>\n<p><strong>Mario Isola, Motorsport Director</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was a busy, exciting and interesting day, as is often the case when track conditions keep changing rapidly. In the last free practice session, we saw drivers mainly doing laps with a low fuel load: the few who tried to gather data on tyre behaviour over a longer distance, running with more fuel on board, did not have much time to do so as the rain arrived. But this did allow them to learn more about the intermediate tyre and to calculate the crossover time to slicks (112%) on a demanding track like Silverstone and from the comments we have received from the teams and drivers, everything seems to be in line with expectations, both in terms of warm-up and car balance.</p>\n<p>\"Track conditions improved rapidly throughout qualifying as it gradually dried out, with the order changing constantly right up to the chequered flag. Everyone used the Soft tyres and the C3 proved to have excellent warm-up, even though air and track temperatures were considerably lower than yesterday&#8217;s, also considering that drivers chose to wait several minutes for the green light, sitting in the fast lane in the pits, therefore without the benefit of the blankets.</p>\n<p>\"Tomorrow&#8217;s race should be run in the dry, although the forecast here is traditionally a bit haphazard. In terms of strategy, the C3 presents itself more and more as a viable choice and so a two-stop is probably the quickest option. That means we can expect to see different choices between the teams leading to more excitement and uncertainty.\"</p>\n\n    </div>",
            "text": "Red Bull It was a mixed day at Red Bull, for while Max Verstappen charged to yet another pole position \u2013 his fifth in a row and seventh of the season so far \u2013 team mate Sergio Perez dropped out in Q1 to continue his painful qualifying run. The Mexican later gained a position after Valtteri Bottas was disqualified. It means Verstappen is likely to be fighting the McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri by himself during Sunday\u2019s Grand Prix. Max Verstappen, 1st, 1:26.720 \"It was quite a crazy qualifying, very hectic and slippery in some places. I had a little \u2018inchident\u2019 in the pit lane, I understeered as I turned and the car just went straight - I think there was quite a bit of damage. That aside, very happy. Equally, I\u2019m very happy for McLaren, you could see how excited everyone was in that garage, they\u2019ve worked so hard, it\u2019s also great for the British fans too. I\u2019m expecting the Ferraris and Mercedes to be more competitive during the race. As for us, we know that we have a good race car and I\u2019m already looking forward to it. I don\u2019t mind if it\u2019s wet tomorrow, in FP3 we were very fast in the wet so I don\u2019t think we need to worry.\" Sergio Perez, 15th, 1:29.968 \"Today was quite disappointing. The red flag lasted a lot longer than we initially thought it would so we lost some heat on the tyres and couldn\u2019t get enough temperature back into them. We also struggled with the weather. The changing conditions made things a lot trickier, so we ended up having a poor qualifying. We had a good session yesterday so, for now, we need to look forward to tomorrow and just aim to get any many points as possible. It\u2019s going to be difficult to come through the field but we will try our very best.\" Christian Horner, Team Principal \"A mixed bag from qualifying today. The weather was about as British as it gets; raining while sunny. This complicated things for us slightly but it looks like the race will be dryer so we won\u2019t have to flip flop between inters and slicks as we have done today. The change in conditions means we won\u2019t be able to take a lot of the data from practice with us but we will certainly take the pole from qualifying. \"It was another great performance from Max, his 5th pole in a row. Conversely, another tough quali for Checo but remaining confident for a good run tomorrow with plenty to race for.\"\n\nPole went to Verstappen and Red Bull in a wet-dry qualifying at Silverstone\n\nMercedes Mercedes had a quiet start to their British Grand Prix weekend, and while qualifying brought an improvement, George Russell and Lewis Hamilton (after a wild spin in Q1) had to settle for sixth and seventh on the grid. Starting just behind the Ferraris, there could be quite a battle between the red and black cars on race day. Lewis Hamilton, 7th, 1:27.211 \"We weren\u2019t quite quick enough today unfortunately. The conditions were tricky out there but there was still an element of fun to it, as we tried to get on top of the tyres. There were some moments where it looked like we had the potential to challenge further forward, but then we fell back a little. We seem to struggle on the single lap more than we do on the race pace, so we will see what we can do tomorrow. If we can progress forward, then that would be amazing. Hopefully we can put some pressure on the cars ahead and get into a battle with them.\" George Russell, 6th, 1:27.155 \"It was an exciting session; I really enjoy these conditions. I\u2019m always confident that I can do a good job and put the laps in when needed. It was stressful at times, but I felt comfortable with our pace in Q1 and Q2. My last lap in Q3 was strong, but it was frustrating to see how close we were to being a couple of positions further forward. I was a little bit disappointed not to achieve this but we\u2019re in a decent place for tomorrow. The Team did a good job of improving the car overnight and I\u2019m excited to see what we can do in the Grand Prix. We believe we have stronger race pace than on the single lap, so I\u2019m confident that we can move forward. \"Once again, the energy from the fans today has been amazing. You really feel the support from the stands and it\u2019s incredible to see how they are backing the Team and us as drivers. It\u2019s a special weekend and we can hopefully do a good job tomorrow and challenge for the podium.\" Toto Wolff, Team Principal and CEO \"It was an interesting session today, with the gap between P2 and P7 only a few tenths. We were more competitive than we thought we might be in terms of lap time, and the gap to the front-row is small. That is not an excuse though and P6 and P7 are the positions we are in. The question for us now is how much pace differential you need in order to overtake. There are several cars ahead of us but we\u2019re hopeful we can make some good progress. \"Whilst it\u2019s frustrating in one sense, it's also encouraging to see the lap time gains that others have found, including McLaren recently. It\u2019s a good example of how you can add performance during the season. We\u2019ve been able to do so ourselves and we\u2019re focused on continuing to do that. This will help us compete on both Saturday and Sunday, and ultimately close the gap to the front.\" Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director \"Qualifying wasn\u2019t an easy session; there were a few bands of rain coming through that kept us on our toes. In those conditions, it\u2019s easy to get a car knocked out along the way but we have both well in the top 10. It\u2019s frustrating to be on the wrong side of a tight bunch today, but the gap to pole is a big improvement on Friday. \"Our long run pace looked good yesterday, so we\u2019re hoping to be able to push forward. We also haven\u2019t made any changes to the car that should hurt that race pace. We\u2019d prefer to be starting further up as it would certainly help our chances of getting on the podium, but there are still opportunities on strategy that will allow us to offset. Whether McLaren have the race pace to match their qualifying speed will influence the strategy significantly. It\u2019s going to be an interesting Grand Prix as there could be plenty of cars in the battle for the podium.\"\n\nMercedes finished behind Verstappen\u2019s Red Bull, the McLarens and the Ferraris\n\nAston Martin After dropping down the order in Austria, it was more of the same for Aston Martin during qualifying at Silverstone, with Fernando Alonso making it through to Q3 and placing ninth, while Lance Stroll dropped out in Q2 en route to 12th, having been involved in a squabble for track position with Alpine rival Esteban Ocon. Fernando Alonso, 9th, 1:27.659 \"It's not the Qualifying we wanted in what was a challenging session in drying conditions. There is still a long race ahead of us tomorrow and our Sunday pace is normally a strong point of this car. \"We still achieved another Q3 result, but we need to keep understanding our car at different circuits. The weather tomorrow may also be changeable, as it was today, so we need to remain focused and see what we can do in race conditions.\" Lance Stroll, 12th, 1:28.935 \"I think more was possible in Qualifying today. The red flag forced us to run a third set of tyres in Q1, which meant we didn\u2019t have a new set in Q2 and that put us on the back foot in comparison to others. \"It's a long race tomorrow and the AMR23 is feeling good, so I'll be doing my best to fight through the pack and put on a good show for the home fans.\" Mike Krack, Team Principal \"One of the most challenging Qualifying sessions of the year so far with a drying track, the constant threat of rain, and a red flag just before the end of Q1. \"Overall we missed the absolute pace to be fighting for the top positions today so we need to review things, understand where we can find more performance, and take those learnings going forward. We will try to come back stronger tomorrow in front of the passionate British fans who will be out in force.\"\n\nAlonso led the Aston Martin charge but could do no more than ninth\n\nFerrari Ferrari ended the first day of practice hot on the heels of Red Bull, with Carlos Sainz only marginally slower than Max Verstappen. But the mixed qualifying session yielded only fourth and fifth, with McLaren pair Norris and Piastri making the most of the tricky conditions to slot ahead of the SF-23s \u2013 Charles Leclerc bouncing back from missing FP2 with a technical problem to edge out Sainz. Charles Leclerc, 4th, 1:27.136 \"A pretty good qualifying, considering that I struggled a bit in the last few races in mixed conditions on slick tyres. I felt good today, because it seems that the hard work I\u2019ve put in to improve this has paid off. I didn\u2019t put the perfect lap together in Q3 as I lost grip in turn 15, so a front row position was not possible today. \"It\u2019s nice to see McLaren be so quick and I expect an exciting race tomorrow with all of us so close together. We don\u2019t have any race trim data on my side because I missed out on FP2, but we maximised every session since then and are in a decent starting position, so everything is possible tomorrow.\" Carlos Sainz, 5th, 1:27.148 \"It was not a bad Saturday overall after a very challenging Quali. The field was very tight and the conditions were changing all the time, so to produce a solid session like we did was not easy. \"Tomorrow we can expect a nice battle with the cars around us so I expect an intense race. We\u2019ll give absolutely everything to bring home a good result.\" Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Vasseur, Team Principal \"All three parts of qualifying were very exciting for the fans and spectators. It was good for Formula 1, good for the show. For our part, it was a bit so-so, even if we are in front of our direct competitors. But there was room to do better as Charles made a slight mistake in turn 15 which affected his lap time. What is important is that we are not far off the pace. \"We are still trying to be more consistent with regard to tyre degradation and we saw at the last two races, at very different tracks, that we have made a good step with this. Silverstone is a more demanding circuit in this regard and on paper, it did not look as though it would suit us, but we have been competitive and we can try and move up the order tomorrow. It\u2019s hard to know what to expect from the weather: it changes every hour and the race lasts two hours! But we are very motivated.\"\n\nLeclerc finished ahead of Sainz despite missing FP2 with technical trouble\n\nAlpine Like Aston Martin, Alpine got one car into Q3 and saw the other eliminated in Q2. With Ocon hindered by that aforementioned incident involving the green machine of Stroll, it was Pierre Gasly who finished as the fastest of the Enstone drivers, rounding out the top 10 in the pole position shootout. Esteban Ocon, 13th, 1:28.956 \u201cIt\u2019s been a frustrating day and a missed opportunity for us in Qualifying. It\u2019s always disappointing not to make Q3, especially as we had the pace to do so. The conditions were not easy but we had been managing it very well. In Q2, it was not an ideal start to my final push lap as I braked on the wet side of the track alongside Lance [Stroll] and then spent my lap behind Charles [Leclerc], which cost us time. There are plenty of things for us to review from today, however, I\u2019m feeling ready to make up some ground in tomorrow\u2019s race.\u201d Pierre Gasly, 10th, 1:27.689 \u201cThat was a very challenging Qualifying to manage with the varying conditions. That said, when it is like that it\u2019s often very exciting on-track and it certainly was enjoyable at the wheel. While I\u2019m pleased to be in Q3 again, I\u2019m disappointed we weren\u2019t able to qualify any higher up than tenth place. We know the areas where we are lacking performance and we have to keep pushing hard as a team to find improvements to our package. Tomorrow, we will give it our all. The start of the race is going to be critical to make up some places and I\u2019m confident we can come away with points on the board.\u201d Alan Permane, Sporting Director \u201cWe\u2019re all disappointed with today\u2019s Qualifying performance as the minimum target, as always for us, is to have both cars well inside Q3. The weather and conditions proved tricky and it was all about being on track at the right time. We managed that well on both sides of the garage to advance through Q1 where all drivers found significant lap time improvement after the first red flag. Esteban did not progress further than Q2 while Pierre was able to reach Q3. There was probably a small amount of lap time left on the table for Pierre in a very tight session. We have a lot of work ahead of us if we\u2019re to have both cars inside the top ten tomorrow. It\u2019s usually a long, tough race here and we have every confidence that we can have a strong afternoon.\u201d\n\nAlpine were on the fringes of the top 10 positions during qualifying\n\nMcLaren After a tough start to the season, McLaren appeared to take a significant step forward with major updates on Lando Norris\u2019 car in Austria. With the new parts fitted to both the Briton and Oscar Piastri\u2019s chrome-liveried machines this weekend at Silverstone, they doubled down on that performance with a stunning run to second and third in qualifying, launching into contention in the mixed conditions that they have excelled in in recent times. Lando Norris, 2nd, 1:26.961 \"That was close! Two-tenths to P1 in Q3, is pretty insane. My last lap was a good lap. I could hear Zak on the radio on the in-lap, which is the best thing ever. I\u2019m grateful. For us to achieve second and third is pretty amazing for the whole team, with all the hard work that we've been putting in, especially to do it here in Silverstone. To do that with the chrome livery at our home race, for the team, for myself, is amazing. Big thanks to the whole crowd here, they\u2019re amazing. It's been a very special day for us. I look forward to tomorrow.\" Oscar Piastri, 3rd, 1:27.092 \"I\u2019m very, very, very happy. I mean, what a qualifying session. The car was a rocket ship in Q2 and Q3, I feel like I put a pretty good lap together. It\u2019s a massive result for the team and the hard work that\u2019s gone into bringing upgrades to the car. To have both of us up here is a mega result. Now we've just got to try and stay there for tomorrow. We know that will be a challenge, but we\u2019re looking forward to it.\" Andrea Stella, Team Principal \"It\u2019s great to see two McLarens up towards the top of the qualifying standings here at Silverstone. P2 and P3 has been achieved in tricky conditions today: the team had to be switched-on to get us through the first two sessions. We could then capitalise on that with strong laps from Lando and Oscar in Q3. A big positive is that we could confirm the progress we saw in Austria and the further upgrades we brought here. For that, I have to thank everyone at the factory and here trackside for their hard work, commitment and dedication. We have an incredible team, and we should enjoy today and use this as extra motivation going forward. We now focus on preparing for the race and look forward to tomorrow. We are realistic for the race as we know we have quick cars around us, but we will give our best in tomorrow\u2019s British Grand Prix.\"\n\nIt was a brilliant day at Silverstone for McLaren duo Norris and Piastri\n\nHaas Haas came close to getting a car into Q3 with Nico Hulkenberg\u2019s run to 11th, but that was the limit for the team on an otherwise challenging day. Indeed, Kevin Magnussen wound up 20th and last after his VF-23 ground to a halt and brought out the red flags in Q1, leaving him with a lonely walk back to the pits. He will start 19th thanks to Bottas' disqualification. Nico Hulkenberg, 11th, 1:28.896 \"It was tricky obviously with the damp and wet patches, it\u2019s quite sketchy, and it can go wrong but it didn\u2019t. I think it was a good qualifying and I feel like I squeezed everything out of it. It was close with Alpine but not having DRS actually hurt us quite a bit. I think we\u2019re a bit more \u2018draggy\u2019 and have more downforce than other cars, so missing DRS wasn\u2019t ideal for us.\" Kevin Magnussen, 19th, 1:32.378 \"It just doesn\u2019t seem to be my year this one so far, but this is where you show experience, stay cool and keep fighting. Everything switched off in the car, I had no power steering, nothing, I don\u2019t know what it was in Q1. Until that point it felt good compared to the rest of the weekend, I was on a decent lap to improve there \u2013 on the one I stopped. There was still time on the clock so I don\u2019t know if that would have been the last one.\" Guenther Steiner, Team Principal \"Due to the changing conditions, it was very difficult to read into FP3. We did what we wanted to do but we took no conclusions from it because of the variable conditions, between the weather, track surface, and everything else. We knew that though and we tried a few things, and they went well. We just missed out on Q3 in qualifying, just by a bit, as Nico was very close behind a car in the very fast sector and obviously that\u2019s not good, especially with our car. With Kevin, we had an issue with the oil system, we lost all the oil, but hopefully the engine isn\u2019t damaged.\"\n\nMagnussen triggered a red flag when he stopped out on track in Q1\n\nAlfa Romeo Alfa Romeo pair Valtteri Bottas and Zhou Guanyu were encouraged by the early signs from the upgrade package the team unleashed this weekend, but they had little to celebrate after qualifying. Bottas placed 11th in Q1, but could not participate in Q2 after he parked up at the side of the track, leaving him 15th. He was later disqualified from qualified after his car couldn't provide a fuel sample, leaving him 20th. Zhou, meanwhile, could do no more than 18th on the damp track surface but was elevated a position thanks to his team mate's disqualification. Valtteri Bottas, 20th, 1:29.798 \u201cToday\u2019s results are very disappointing, as it seemed we actually had a real chance to make it into the top ten. I started to lose power on the final inlap, and then the engine stopped. We eventually figured out it was a technical issue with fuel in the car, and we are already working to address that and make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. Sadly, this means we\u2019ll be starting at the back of the grid in the race, which is not where we would have deserved to be looking at our pace. Still, tomorrow will be a long day and, as always, the weather could add one more element of unpredictability: the car felt better than yesterday, and we have slightly better pace compared to previous events, so our aim will be to make the most out of it and fight as hard as we can through the field.\u201d Zhou Guanyu, 17th, 1:30.123 \"I think we had the potential to improve our performance this weekend, but unfortunately, today has been quite tricky for our team and we couldn\u2019t maximise our chances. I had no running time during the final practice session because of a technical issue that the team promptly investigated and addressed, allowing me to get back on track ahead of qualifying. There, too, my running chances were limited, and I struggled with finding enough grip, eventually getting only one timed lap which wasn\u2019t enough to make it through to Q2. We are of course disappointed not to have had an actual shot at moving forward, but our main aim now will be to regroup and come prepared ahead of tomorrow.\" Alessandro Alunni Bravi, Team Representative \"We are undoubtedly disappointed, as we felt more than on previous days that we had the potential to do well. With Valtteri we showed we were comfortably into Q2, but a technical issue related to fuel forced him to stop, and to pull out of qualifying. Unfortunately, the problem meant we weren\u2019t able to submit the required fuel sample to the scrutineers, which lead to Valtteri being disqualified from the session. It\u2019s a pity as he had been doing an excellent job, and we are sorry to see his chances of a good qualifying session seriously damaged. For Zhou, it has been more difficult: he completely sat out of FP3 because of a car issue, and then wasn\u2019t able to move into Q2. It is in moments like these that the team needs to regroup and stick together, and push each other to further improve; we must aim to execute a better weekend. Tomorrow will be challenging, but we are not letting our heads down after today\u2019s result: we\u2019ll be ready to do our job, and carry out a good race to allow us to recover the ground we have lost.\"\n\nBottas was another to suffer a qualifying stoppage, parking up at the side of the track in Q2\n\nWilliams Williams showed plenty of promise on Friday and, while they moved to play down their expectations, Alex Albon converted it to take a fine eighth in qualifying \u2013 surviving an early scare in Q1 when the conditions were at their most precarious. Logan Sargeant could not join him in Q3 after seeing two of his lap times deleted during the Q2 phase for exceeding track limits. Logan Sargeant, 14th, 1:29.031 \"For me, the first goal of this weekend was to get into Q2, and I achieved that. It was a tricky session all in all. We can\u2019t catch a break from mixed conditions at the moment. We knew it was going to be a lot closer coming into qualifying than we saw in practice. It\u2019s a shame that I didn\u2019t have a new set of tyres at the end of Q2 as I think that probably cost us the chance of transferring to Q3. At the end of the day, the car was in a good place and we\u2019re making steps in the right direction. I\u2019m happy with the steps that I\u2019m making this weekend. I still have plenty of steps to take which is clear to me. As long as I\u2019m moving in the right direction that\u2019s the positive part and we can build off that to have a good race tomorrow. It won\u2019t be easy starting 14th with a lot of quick cars around us but we\u2019ll do our best.\u201d Alex Albon, 8th, 1:27.530 \"It\u2019s been an amazing weekend but it\u2019s funny when you finish in Q3, with P8 and you\u2019re disappointed.We have to be realistic but it\u2019s been great so far. In Qualifying, the session was going quite smoothly but, as the track dried out, corner speeds picked up and track evolution came in. We started to get quite a bit of degradation through the lap, even front deg, so we need to go away and understand that but, by the time I got to Q3, I was struggling a little bit with those combined factors. We\u2019ve been really on top of it since the start of the weekend and I got into rhythm very quickly and adapted well to the changes, so we really hit the ground running. I think we ended up where we expected to be but I think if you told us we\u2019d be here at the beginning of the weekend, we wouldn\u2019t believe you.\" Dave Robson, Head of Vehicle Performance \"Today was exceptionally difficult with mixed and varying conditions throughout the day. We timed the run on Soft tyres well in FP3; whilst this allowed us to learn quite a lot about the car, it gave us a position on the timesheet that flattered our true pace. However, both drivers were still happy with the car balance and comfortable going into qualifying. \"Qualifying was a rollercoaster with both Alex and Logan struggling to get a representative lap done around the showers in Q1. The red flag allowed us to reset and both showed excellent pace and composure to deliver very good laps under pressure. Q2 was much calmer for Alex and he was very quick in comfortably making Q3. Logan found the conditions a little more difficult and had to do his final lap on a more used set from Q1, which cost him the couple of tenths that he needed to progress. Alex was very strong on the used Soft at the beginning of Q3 but couldn\u2019t quite find the final bit of grip as the track dried. Nonetheless, it was a potentially very difficult qualifying session and we dealt with it well and have both cars in a useful position for the Grand Prix tomorrow as a result.\"\n\nAlbon gave the home fans even more to cheer about with his qualifying display\n\nAlphaTauri AlphaTauri were the only team to lose both cars in Q1 at Silverstone, with Yuki Tsunoda winding up 17th and Nyck de Vries placing 19th, ahead of only the sidelined Magnussen. Both moved up a place thanks to Bottas' disqualification but it leaves the Italian team \u2013 now last in the constructors\u2019 standings \u2013 with plenty of work to do if they are to claim points on Sunday. Nyck de Vries, 18th, 1:30.513 \"I ended up very close to Q2 again, it\u2019s frustrating and a shame, but I\u2019m happy with my performance. Track evolution was high and almost fully dry in the end, but the team did a good job with the strategy. We tried many different things with the new upgrade, and compared to yesterday, the car felt better. I feel more support in the places I need, especially in the low-speed corners, and more rotation in the high-speed corners, which we were aiming for. There is room for improvement, but we\u2019re still trying to understand the car\u2019s behaviour more. I reset myself and do whatever I can tomorrow to extract as much performance from the car and finish as high as possible.\" Yuki Tsunoda, 16th, 1:30.025 \"Today\u2019s qualifying was a very tricky session, with changing conditions as the rain was coming. We did a decent lap at the beginning of qualifying, but towards the end, when it became a one-lap shootout, my tyres were very cold. I didn\u2019t have the confidence and temperature to push and attack as required, making a mistake in the last corner where I out braked myself and went deep, losing a lot of time there. During the session, we were more competitive and in the mix, so I feel our final lap wasn\u2019t entirely representative. In these changing conditions, we maybe didn\u2019t put it together when it mattered. We did some long runs in practice, but it\u2019s certainly not going to be easy tomorrow. A big part of the track is high-speed, so it\u2019s difficult to overtake and follow, so a little rain is welcome because it might bring some opportunities.\" Jonathan Eddolls, Chief Race Engineer \"The run programme for both cars in Q1 was smooth, with the right tyres fitted, the right sequence of push and cool laps being adopted, and the timing to box for a new set sensible. However, the red flag disrupted things and unfortunately, the final runs were not good enough. Frustratingly, Yuki was very close to making the cut for Q2, but due to a snap during brake entry, he lost a little time during turn 16. Nyck was further away with his final run, so we need to look into the data to understand what happened. Our starting positions make things more difficult for the race, but we\u2019ll be fully focused on being ready to take any opportunities which allow us to move forwards with both cars tomorrow.\"\n\nAlphaTauri suffered a double Q1 exit with Tsunoda and De Vries",

The regulations should, in theory, close up the field and the current rules are in place until at least 2025.\n\nThe period now will likely be more important for next year, rather than this season because most teams will begin to move their focus to the 2024 cars.\n\nMax Verstappen, Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton shared the podium at the Canadian Grand Prix\n\nSky Sports F1's live Austrian GP schedule\n\nThursday June 29\n\n2pm: Drivers' Press Conference\n\nFriday June 30\n\n8.50am: F3 Practice\n\n10am: F2 Practice\n\n12pm: Austrian GP Practice (session starts 12.30)\n\n1.55pm: F3 Qualifying\n\n2.50pm: F2 Qualifying\n\n3.30pm: Austrian GP Qualifying build-up\n\n4pm: Austrian GP Qualifying\n\n6pm: Ted's Qualifying Notebook\n\nSaturday July 1\n\n8.55am: F3 Sprint\n\n10.30am: Austrian GP Sprint Shootout build-up\n\n11am: Austrian GP Sprint Shootout\n\n12.40pm: F2 Sprint\n\n2.30pm: Austrian GP Sprint build-up\n\n3.30pm: Austrian GP Sprint\n\n5pm: Ted's Sprint Notebook\n\nSunday July 2\n\n7.20am: F3 Feature Race\n\n8.50am: F2 Feature Race\n\n12.30pm: Grand Prix Sunday Austrian GP build-up\n\n2pm: The AUSTRIAN GRAND PRIX\n\n4pm: Chequered Flag: Austrian GP reaction\n\n5pm: Ted's Notebook",

It\u2019s important to see a clear trend over a couple of years.\n\n\u201cIt will be difficult to improve on the position next year \u2013 we have to be realistic! But that does not mean we will not try.\u201d",

Nevertheless, for Britain\u2019s most successful F1 constructor, celebrating on home turf seems fitting.\n\nThe FW45 will run in its familiar blue livery with a British flag on the engine cover and a matching white rear wing, and will retain the paint scheme for the Hungarian Grand Prix\n\nMcLaren\u2019s chrome livery\n\nAfter apparently years of asking, Lando Norris will at last be able to race in a chrome covered McLaren \u2014 a nod to the team\u2019s former livery it ran from 2006-2014, to one of its current sponsors, and a continuation of its 60th anniversary celebrations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say every year I\u2019ve been pestering [Zak Brown] a little bit to want to go back a little bit in that direction,\u201d said Norris at the unveiling of the livery. \u201cThat\u2019s what I grew up watching, that\u2019s what I fell in love with in many ways. I feel like I can say it, it inspired me to be a Formula 1 driver.\u201d\n\nThis weekend\u2019s car will feature chrome sections, littered with papaya orange and a matching helmet for Norris who will hope to emulate Lewis Hamilton\u2018s success in similar colours \u2013 winning McLaren\u2019s last world title in 2008.\n\nAston Martin\u2019s Valvoline livery\n\nUnlike its F1 peers, Aston Martin will be running a minimalist one-off livery \u2013 celebrating a new partnership with Valvoline Global, its official lubricant partner.\n\nThe brand\u2019s colours \u2013 red and blue \u2013 will be displayed on the Aston\u2019s engine cover and part of the side pod, while its logo will be added to the front wing.",

            "text": "Recent car upgrades appear to have paid off for Mercedes, which had a double podium finish from Lewis Hamilton and George Russell in Spain. They will be hoping to carry that momentum into the 2023 Canadian Grand Prix on Sunday. However, Max Verstappen was still too much to handle, finishing ahead of Hamilton and Russell. The Red Bull Racing driver, who won this race last year, is the -275 favorite (risk $275 to win $100) in the 2023 Canadian Grand Prix odds at Caesars Sportsbook.\n\nTeammate Sergio Perez is second on the F1 odds board at 5-1, while Hamilton is 11-1. Which drivers should you target with your 2023 Canadian Grand Prix bets? Before analyzing the 2023 Canadian Grand Prix starting grid and making any Formula 1 picks, be sure to check out the latest 2023 Canadian GP predictions and betting advice from SportsLine's proven projection model.\n\nDeveloped by daily Fantasy pro and SportsLine predictive data engineer Mike McClure, this proprietary Formula 1 prediction model simulates every race 10,000 times, taking into account factors such as track history and recent results. It's had a strong history of success in motorsports, correctly predicting nine NASCAR winners since the 2021 season and its projected leaderboards have forecasted winners across multiple racing formats.\n\nThe model has been scorching hot when it comes to picking Formula 1 race events dating back to 2021. It nailed both of Leclerc's wins in 2022, and at the 2021 Mexican Grand Prix, the model was strongly backing Verstappen as its top pick. The result: Verstappen dominated the field and ran away with a surprise victory.\n\nThe model followed that up by calling Verstappen's win at the Rolex Emilia Romagna GP in April and then nailed his wins again in Belgium, the Netherlands, Japan, the United States, Mexico and Abu Dhabi. It's also nailed Verstappen's wins in Bahrain, Australia, Miami, Monaco and Spain this season. Anyone who followed the model's lead on those plays has seen huge returns\n\nNow, the model has dialed in on the 2023 Formula 1 Canadian Grand Prix and just released its coveted picks and leaderboard projections. You can head to SportsLine now to see the complete 2023 Canadian Grand Prix leaderboard projection.\n\nTop 2023 Formula 1 Canadian GP predictions\n\nOne massive shocker: The model is high on Fernando Alonso even though he's the fourth favorite at 12-1 and coming off his worst finish of the season (t-7th) in Spain. He has enjoyed an excellent start to his debut campaign with the Silverstone-based Aston Martin, finishing on the podium in five of the first seven races of the season. Alonso sits third in the championship standings with 99 points, even after his disappointing finish in Barcelona.\n\nHis best result came in Monaco when he finished in second place, but the team is ready to make the leap to winning a race. The two-time world champion has shown glimpses of his former self during his first year with Aston Martin, and he won the 2006 Canadian Grand Prix. His current form and past success at this track make him a valuable driver to include in 2023 Canadian Grand Prix picks. See who else the model is backing and who it is fading right here.\n\nHow to make 2023 Canadian Grand Prix picks\n\nThe model is also targeting one longshot getting triple-digit Canadian GP odds to make a surprising surge up the leaderboard. Anyone who backs him could hit it big. You can find out who he is, and see all of the model's F1 picks and predictions at SportsLine.\n\nSo who wins the Canadian Grand Prix 2023, and which under-the-radar drivers makes a stunning charge towards the front?

Which is of course what makes it so interesting.</p><p>With McLaren apparently in the podium mix with the rest of the regular frontrunners, with Alex Albon steering an unexpectedly punchy Williams and with Sergio P&#233;rez yet again needing to recover from a poor qualifying performance, the British Grand Prix is beautifully set up to be a cracker.</p><p class=\"ecpz18-0 bfbmyA\"></p><p class=\"ecpz18-0 jWyhkq\"></p><p><b>McLAREN DELIVERS SOMETHING TANGIBLE</b></p><p>It&#8217;s not just with its partially chrome livery that McLaren is attempting to recapture the glory of the 2000s. This weekend its on-track performances are doing a good job of banishing years of bad memories.</p><p>Norris qualified second and just 0.241 seconds of pole. Piastri was third and only 0.131 seconds further back.</p><p>This is the same McLaren that fielded the slowest car at the opening race of the year.</p><p>The route to the team&#8217;s sensational two-there qualification goes via two major stops.</p><p>The first is the upgrade package, the talk of the paddock for the last week.</p><p class=\"ecpz18-0 kMdhGx\"></p><p>The concept-changing update is significant enough the team has likened it to a &#8220;B-spec&#8221; car, and it&#8217;s big enough that it&#8217;s coming over three grands prix.</p><p>Norris got half of it in Austria and another 25 per cent of it this weekend. Piastri got the first 50 per cent for Silverstone and will catch up on the rest in the coming races.</p><p>Fourth in Austria for Norris was promising, but he&#8217;s always fast there. A more aerodynamically demanding circuit like Silverstone would be a sterner test.</p><p>So far it&#8217;s passing the exam with flying colours.</p><p>It&#8217;s particularly flattering for Piastri, who&#8217;s barely behind Norris despite lacking the newest front wing and nose.</p><p>A look at the telemetry shows the MCL60 is losing time to the RB19 really only in two key areas: at the end of the straights, where Red Bull Racing&#8217;s trick DRS has its biggest advantage, and at the slowest part of the track, namely the Vale chicane.</p><p class=\"ecpz18-0 fEGMZh\"></p><p></p><p>The summary of the data is that the car has become much more efficient &#8212; that is, it&#8217;s carrying plenty of downforce without the drag that used to weigh it down. That&#8217;s massively promising.</p><p>Piastri called it a &#8220;rocket ship&#8221; and Max Verstappen said he was &#8220;surprised&#8221; at seeing both McLaren cars in the top three.</p><p>But it&#8217;s important to keep expectations in check.</p><p>Austria and Britain still form a small sample size. They&#8217;re also both circuits at which McLaren, or at least Norris, overperformed last season.</p><p>The weather also played into McLaren&#8217;s hands.</p><p class=\"ecpz18-0 jWyhkq\"></p><p>We&#8217;ve seen already this season in places like Barcelona and Montreal that the MCL60, which fires up its tyres rapidly, loves qualifying in cool and damp conditions &#8212; every other summer day in Britain, much like we saw on Saturday.</p><p>Both drivers got into Q3 in Spain and Canada but at neither race did either score points. Tyre wear cruelled their race pace.</p><p>Given Friday&#8217;s race simulations were unclear as to where McLaren stood, that could yet happen again Sunday.</p><p>But there&#8217;s obviously a step change between a couple of chance Q3 outings and a strong two-three on the grid. The team will surely be targeting double points this time around. A double top five or even double podium would be a remarkable statement result.</p><p>Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said: &#8220;McLaren have taken a massive step clearly so we need to see if that consolidates.</p><p>&#8220;They are a force to be reckoned with now.&#8221;</p><p class=\"ecpz18-0 bfbmyA\"></p><p>Regardless of what happens next, Piastri summed it up: &#8220;From where we were at the start of the season to where we are now is a massive step in the right direction.&#8221;</p><p>And for those who insist that they saw this strong result coming, here&#8217;s some help with today&#8217;s bold prediction.</p><p>The last time McLaren drivers started second and third on the grid, Daniel Ricciardo led Norris to a one-two finish at the 2021 Italian Grand Prix.</p><p></p><p><b>SERGIO P&#201;REZ FLOPS AGAIN</b></p><p>Red Bull Racing&#8217;s RB19 has taken every pole bar one so far this season.</p><p class=\"ecpz18-0 kMdhGx\"></p><p>Sergio P&#233;rez has failed to make the top 10 six times this season. Three times he&#8217;s been eliminated in the bottom five of the grid.</p><p>We&#8217;re well past the point of considering what effect this is having on his long-faded championship aspirations. The damage is now all reputational.</p><p>There were several crucial factors behind P&#233;rez&#8217;s latest failure, and while not all of them are owned directly by him, responsibility is overwhelmingly sheeted home to the Mexican.</p><p>His first mistake came in the damp opening phase of Q1, when he failed to set a competitive lap time.</p><p>When the red flag was called with three minutes on the clock, P&#233;rez was 1.4 seconds slower than the then session-leading Verstappen.</p><p>That put him under pressure to deliver with just a single flying lap to make the cut.</p><p class=\"ecpz18-0 fEGMZh\"></p><p>Here&#8217;s where the team&#8217;s influence on the result comes in.</p><p>P&#233;rez was sent to the end of the pit lane to ensure he didn&#8217;t get caught in traffic, but this had two negative effects. The first was it allowed his tyres cool significantly ahead of that crucial lap. The second was that it put him on the track at the worst time, when the circuit was slowest.</p><p>The track was drying rapidly as the sun broke through the clouds at this point. The ideal time to set a lap was at the very last moment, not the first.</p><p>But it would be an exaggeration to say this set him up to fail.</p><p>Directly behind him on the track was Alex Albon, who was therefore dealing with very similar conditions.

            "text": "If you picked the top three qualifying results for the British Grand Prix, you\u2019re lying.\n\nMax Verstappen, sure. The Dutchman taking his fifth successive pole and seventh for the season is no great shock.\n\nBut you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to convince that you forecast Verstappen having to set two Q3 laps to take top spot after losing provision pole to Lando Norris.\n\nAnd are you really going to try to argue that you foresaw that Oscar Piastri, in a car not quite up to the latest specification, leading the second row from third place?\n\nWatch the Formula 1 British Grand Prix 2023 live and ad-break free in racing on Kayo Sports on Monday, 10 July, at 12:00am AEST. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now >\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s all very unlikely. Which is of course what makes it so interesting.\n\nWith McLaren apparently in the podium mix with the rest of the regular frontrunners, with Alex Albon steering an unexpectedly punchy Williams and with Sergio P\u00e9rez yet again needing to recover from a poor qualifying performance, the British Grand Prix is beautifully set up to be a cracker.\n\nMcLAREN DELIVERS SOMETHING TANGIBLE\n\nIt\u2019s not just with its partially chrome livery that McLaren is attempting to recapture the glory of the 2000s. This weekend its on-track performances are doing a good job of banishing years of bad memories.\n\nNorris qualified second and just 0.241 seconds of pole. Piastri was third and only 0.131 seconds further back.\n\nThis is the same McLaren that fielded the slowest car at the opening race of the year.\n\nThe route to the team\u2019s sensational two-there qualification goes via two major stops.\n\nThe first is the upgrade package, the talk of the paddock for the last week.\n\nThe concept-changing update is significant enough the team has likened it to a \u201cB-spec\u201d car, and it\u2019s big enough that it\u2019s coming over three grands prix.\n\nNorris got half of it in Austria and another 25 per cent of it this weekend. Piastri got the first 50 per cent for Silverstone and will catch up on the rest in the coming races.\n\nFourth in Austria for Norris was promising, but he\u2019s always fast there. A more aerodynamically demanding circuit like Silverstone would be a sterner test.\n\nSo far it\u2019s passing the exam with flying colours.\n\nIt\u2019s particularly flattering for Piastri, who\u2019s barely behind Norris despite lacking the newest front wing and nose.\n\nA look at the telemetry shows the MCL60 is losing time to the RB19 really only in two key areas: at the end of the straights, where Red Bull Racing\u2019s trick DRS has its biggest advantage, and at the slowest part of the track, namely the Vale chicane.\n\nThe summary of the data is that the car has become much more efficient \u2014 that is, it\u2019s carrying plenty of downforce without the drag that used to weigh it down. That\u2019s massively promising.\n\nPiastri called it a \u201crocket ship\u201d and Max Verstappen said he was \u201csurprised\u201d at seeing both McLaren cars in the top three.\n\nBut it\u2019s important to keep expectations in check.\n\nAustria and Britain still form a small sample size. They\u2019re also both circuits at which McLaren, or at least Norris, overperformed last season.\n\nThe weather also played into McLaren\u2019s hands.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen already this season in places like Barcelona and Montreal that the MCL60, which fires up its tyres rapidly, loves qualifying in cool and damp conditions \u2014 every other summer day in Britain, much like we saw on Saturday.\n\nBoth drivers got into Q3 in Spain and Canada but at neither race did either score points. Tyre wear cruelled their race pace.\n\nGiven Friday\u2019s race simulations were unclear as to where McLaren stood, that could yet happen again Sunday.\n\nBut there\u2019s obviously a step change between a couple of chance Q3 outings and a strong two-three on the grid. The team will surely be targeting double points this time around. A double top five or even double podium would be a remarkable statement result.\n\nMercedes boss Toto Wolff said: \u201cMcLaren have taken a massive step clearly so we need to see if that consolidates.\n\n\u201cThey are a force to be reckoned with now.\u201d\n\nRegardless of what happens next, Piastri summed it up: \u201cFrom where we were at the start of the season to where we are now is a massive step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nAnd for those who insist that they saw this strong result coming, here\u2019s some help with today\u2019s bold prediction.\n\nThe last time McLaren drivers started second and third on the grid, Daniel Ricciardo led Norris to a one-two finish at the 2021 Italian Grand Prix.\n\nSERGIO P\u00c9REZ FLOPS AGAIN\n\nRed Bull Racing\u2019s RB19 has taken every pole bar one so far this season.\n\nSergio P\u00e9rez has failed to make the top 10 six times this season. Three times he\u2019s been eliminated in the bottom five of the grid.\n\nWe\u2019re well past the point of considering what effect this is having on his long-faded championship aspirations. The damage is now all reputational.\n\nThere were several crucial factors behind P\u00e9rez\u2019s latest failure, and while not all of them are owned directly by him, responsibility is overwhelmingly sheeted home to the Mexican.\n\nHis first mistake came in the damp opening phase of Q1, when he failed to set a competitive lap time.\n\nWhen the red flag was called with three minutes on the clock, P\u00e9rez was 1.4 seconds slower than the then session-leading Verstappen.\n\nThat put him under pressure to deliver with just a single flying lap to make the cut.\n\nHere\u2019s where the team\u2019s influence on the result comes in.\n\nP\u00e9rez was sent to the end of the pit lane to ensure he didn\u2019t get caught in traffic, but this had two negative effects. The first was it allowed his tyres cool significantly ahead of that crucial lap. The second was that it put him on the track at the worst time, when the circuit was slowest.\n\nThe track was drying rapidly as the sun broke through the clouds at this point. The ideal time to set a lap was at the very last moment, not the first.\n\nBut it would be an exaggeration to say this set him up to fail.\n\nDirectly behind him on the track was Alex Albon, who was therefore dealing with very similar conditions. The Thai driver set a time 0.502 seconds quicker.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m struggling in these conditions in the car lately,\u201d P\u00e9rez told Sky Sports. \u201cI think my problems with the car become more apparent in these conditions.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s something we\u2019ve got to understand as a group to try and figure out and try to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nCan he salvage a result from here?\n\nHe has the car to do it, and Silverstone certainly facilitates overtaking. The two DRS zones will also play to his strengths.\n\nAnd he showed in Austria that he\u2019s capable of a big recovery, having risen from 15th to third.\n\n\u201cI think we had a very good Friday in terms of pace, so hopefully we are able to find that,\u201d he said hopefully, noting that in the dry he was much more confident.\n\nBut that confidence looks so fleeting these days.\n\nBRITAIN PROMISES UNPREDICTABLE BATTLE FOR THE PODIUM\n\nBehind McLaren you can still see the usual signs we\u2019ve become used to this season after a qualifying session.\n\nFerrari headed the rest of the pack on single lap pace, and Charles Leclerc probably could\u2019ve pipped Norris had he not made a single mistake at Stowe, where he ran wide onto the wet kerbs and lost a bundle of time. He\u2019d been neck and neck with Verstappen through Maggotts and Becketts.\n\nBut that mistake having been made, Ferrari ended up at the head of a tight battle with Mercedes, which showed up better than expected after a very difficult Friday.\n\nOn paper both teams are quicker than McLaren on race pace \u2014 notwithstanding the opaque Friday data \u2014 and Mercedes is probably faster than Ferrari.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be chasing McLaren, and Mercedes is going to be chasing McLaren and us, so think it\u2019s going to be quite an exciting race,\u201d Carlos Sainz told Sky Sports.\n\nWhincup reveals SVG's huge Nascar plans | 06:58\n\nCombined with the prospect of P\u00e9rez slicing through the field, it should be a fascinating podium battle behind Verstappen.\n\nBut there\u2019s also the added element of Aston Martin, which struggled to its most underwhelming qualifying result of the year. Ninth is Fernando Alonso\u2019s equal worst qualifying position and will give him his outright worst grid spot for 2023.\n\nHe\u2019s not just back behind the factory Mercedes team, he\u2019s also behind the superb Alex Albon too, and we\u2019ve learnt from so many races that the Thai driver is a ferocious defender.\n\n\u201cIt was not a good day obviously,\u201d Alonso told Sky Sports. \u201cNothing we can do now. Let\u2019s hope for a better race tomorrow and to score some good points.\n\n\u201cIt seems like we have to have to be on a defensive strategy this weekend.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first substandard weekend Aston Martin has had this year, but it certainly feels like the team has lost a little bit of the initiative it burst from the blocks with. Just a tiny bit of air has escaped the balloon \u2014 certainly if McLaren has made a genuine jump forward.\n\nIt\u2019s come as Ferrari, Mercedes and now McLaren have all brought big upgrades.\n\n\u201cSome of our competition really improved the car and brought a lot of new parts.

            "text": "By Tom Cary, Senior Sports Correspondent, at Silverstone\n\nGeorge Russell believes he and team-mate Lewis Hamilton can challenge for the podium in Sunday\u2019s British Grand Prix after making big improvements to their set-up overnight, allowing them to claim sixth and seventh on the grid respectively.\n\nA fascinating qualifying session on a drying Silverstone track ended with Red Bull\u2019s runaway championship leader Max Verstappen taking his fifth pole position on the trot. The double world champion will be a huge favourite to extend his championship lead and claim an eighth win of the season.\n\nBut there is plenty of British interest for the anticipated 160,000 fans packing out Silverstone, headed by McLaren\u2019s Lando Norris.\n\nThe 23-year-old claimed a shock second place on the grid, 0.241sec behind Verstappen, with rookie team-mate Oscar Piastri arguably an even more impressive third, a further tenth back, as McLaren built on an impressive weekend in Austria last time out.\n\nThere were a few heady seconds when the Silverstone crowds thought Norris might even have snatched pole, before Verstappen completed his final flying lap.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always Max,\u201d Norris joked afterwards. \u201cHe always ruins everything for everyone.\u201d\n\nBehind the two McLarens are the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz, ahead of Russell and Hamilton in sixth and seventh.\n\nWilliams\u2019 London-born Thai driver Alex Albon starts eighth, just ahead of the Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso, making it four British drivers in the top 10 on the grid.\n\nMercedes were perhaps fortunate that Verstappen\u2019s Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez had yet another disastrous qualifying session, knocked out in Q1 as the drivers left it late to set their times on a rapidly drying circuit following an earlier shower. It was the fifth race in a row the Mexican has failed to make the top 10 shoot-out and will increase the pressure on him.\n\nHamilton also had a scare in Q1, spinning off the track at Stowe, but managed to keep the engine running.\n\nRussell said he expected Mercedes to move forwards rather than backwards given their long-run pace in practice.\n\n\u201cWe had numbers suggesting we were 17th and 18th quickest [in one-lap pace] on Friday and third and fourth quickest [in race pace],\u201d he said. \u201cClearly we have made some improvements.\n\n\u201cI was pretty gutted to see the timesheets to see that we were only half a tenth from P3, which would have been incredible, but my lap felt great. I don\u2019t think there was a lot more in there.\n\n\u201cLewis has been really on it this weekend and pushing me hard. Well done to McLaren they have come from nowhere and they are the big unknown for tomorrow.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he expected to have a strong race on Sunday, Russell nodded: \u201cI think so. We always tend to have a better Sunday than Saturday which is the right way to be. It\u2019s an interesting grid. I think Fernando is a little bit out of position, obviously Checo is well out of position but McLaren is the unknown. They were strong in Austria. They seem really quick here. Let\u2019s see what we can do.\u201d\n\nMercedes team principal Toto Wolff said the big unknown was how much of a pace differential cars would need in order to be able to overtake and his words were echoed by Hamilton, who has an astonishing record at Silverstone.\n\nThe seven-time world champion has won his home grand prix eight times and not finished outside the top three since finishing fourth in 2013.\n\nHamilton said he was slightly frustrated not to have qualified higher than seventh. \u201cWe came here with an upgraded front wing and we were hopeful that was going to help propel us a little bit more forwards,\u201d the 38 year-old said. \u201cBut the car was very much the same today.

In fact, it looks like they might have closed the gap to Red Bull more than anyone expected. Don&#8217;t take my word for it though, let's look at some data.\r</p>\n<h2>FP2 Data: Race Trim</h2> \n \n<p>\nThe long runs help to gauge the actual performance of the car, as these runs are normally done with DRS off. As such, they also provide a clean baseline as to what the real drag of the car is. </p><p>\nThere are two main straights at Silverstone. The first one is the Wellington straight, which depends on your exit from the twisty section in Sector 1, and the second is the Hanger straight after the high-speed chicane Becketts. We will focus on the Hanger straight, as it gives a better idea about the top speed since it's less exit-dependent. </p><p>\nComparing the Red Bull and Ferrari data, we can clearly see the supremacy of the the championship leaders around the high-speed sections of Copse, Maggots and Becketts &#8211; they're just in another league through this section with the fuel in the car.\r</p><p id=\"outb_readmore_oud\"></p> <p>\nHowever, looking at the top speed data for the Hanger straight, we see that both <a href=\"https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-drivers/carlos-sainz/\">Carlos Sainz</a> Jr. and <a href=\"https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-drivers/max-verstappen/\">Max Verstappen</a> clocked 301 km/h at the end of the straight, indicating a fundamental drag improvement of the car with DRS <i><b>off</b></i>.\r</p><img src=\"https://sportsbase.io/images/gpfans/copy_620x348/0b458764d4afbad3e988fb820cfa4cc74149d429.png\">\n<h2>FP2 Data: Quali Trim</h2> <p>\nThe short runs are done with DRS on in qualifying trim to gauge the balance of the car at low fuel and to optimise the battery deployment over the entire lap. </p><p>\nIf we look at the telemetry plots of Sainz and Verstappen, again we see that both of them have a similar top speed of 325 km/h as compared to the rest of the field, who were around 320-322 km/h. Clearly Ferrari have made a big step here as well. </p>\n<p id=\"snackban10\"></p>\n<img src=\"https://sportsbase.io/images/gpfans/copy_620x348/cda466b805509b60c6c2174a0d156e8c1c6cb1be.png\">\n<h2>Top Speed Comparison</h2> <p>\nFrom this plot, we can clearly see that Red Bull and Ferrari are in a league of their own when it comes to top speed. They are ~5 km/h faster than the rest of their main competitors, which is a clear indication that the beam wing update is working.\r</p>\n<p id=\"snackban13\"></p>\n<img src=\"https://sportsbase.io/images/gpfans/copy_620x348/8646fa9356792fa9de0810cbb2c78d07d84642dc.png\"><p>\n<i>Shubham Sangodkar is a former F1 Aerodynamicist with a Master's in Racing Car Design specialising in F1 Aerodynamics and F1 Data Analysis.

Don\u2019t take my word for it though, let's look at some data.\n\nFP2 Data: Race Trim\n\nThe long runs help to gauge the actual performance of the car, as these runs are normally done with DRS off. As such, they also provide a clean baseline as to what the real drag of the car is.\n\nThere are two main straights at Silverstone. The first one is the Wellington straight, which depends on your exit from the twisty section in Sector 1, and the second is the Hanger straight after the high-speed chicane Becketts. We will focus on the Hanger straight, as it gives a better idea about the top speed since it's less exit-dependent.\n\nComparing the Red Bull and Ferrari data, we can clearly see the supremacy of the the championship leaders around the high-speed sections of Copse, Maggots and Becketts \u2013 they're just in another league through this section with the fuel in the car.\n\nHowever, looking at the top speed data for the Hanger straight, we see that both Carlos Sainz Jr. and Max Verstappen clocked 301 km/h at the end of the straight, indicating a fundamental drag improvement of the car with DRS off.\n\nFP2 Data: Quali Trim\n\nThe short runs are done with DRS on in qualifying trim to gauge the balance of the car at low fuel and to optimise the battery deployment over the entire lap.\n\nIf we look at the telemetry plots of Sainz and Verstappen, again we see that both of them have a similar top speed of 325 km/h as compared to the rest of the field, who were around 320-322 km/h. Clearly Ferrari have made a big step here as well.\n\nTop Speed Comparison\n\nFrom this plot, we can clearly see that Red Bull and Ferrari are in a league of their own when it comes to top speed. They are ~5 km/h faster than the rest of their main competitors, which is a clear indication that the beam wing update is working.\n\nShubham Sangodkar is a former F1 Aerodynamicist with a Master's in Racing Car Design specialising in F1 Aerodynamics and F1 Data Analysis.

During its brief stint as Racing Point\u201a before Stroll rebranded it as Aston Martin for 2021\u2014it delivered a strong 2020 car after imitating Mercedes\u2019 2019 package and won a race.\n\nIt was always an efficient outfit, with capable individuals, and there was always the notion of \u2018what could this team do without a compromised financial ceiling and without rivals being able to spend hundreds of millions more.\u2019 Well, while 2021\u2014amid floor regulation changes which hurt the team\u2014and 2022 were mis-steps, 2023 has started brightly.\n\n\u201cI think we need to be careful saying (we are) second (fastest)...\"\n\n\u201cI think we need to be careful saying (we are) second (fastest)\u2014I think we can safely say we made a substantial improvement,\u201d said Krack.\n\nKrack acknowledged that \u201cwe felt we were a bit less competitive in the high-speed in Bahrain\u201d and that the AMR23\u2019s performance at Jeddah erased those fears but stressed \u201cwe have two data samples from two completely different tracks\u2014in these two we were competitive but there are some other (tracks) and we must not underestimate that.\u201d\n\nTeam principal Mike Krack at Aston Martin has had plenty of reasons to smile in 2023. Eric Alonso // Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe are battling here with people that have a different firing power we have in terms of people and infrastructure, as well as being used to do that.\u201d\n\nThat is a pertinent point but Formula 1 is now operating in a cost cap era, meaning limitless money cannot be thrown at problems, while Aston Martin itself has a solid platform.\n\nAston Martin is also now mere weeks away from moving into its new factory at Silverstone and Krack has been buoyed by the atmosphere in the camp.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible\u2014you cannot believe if it if you do not live it,\u201d said Krack. \u201cThere is a huge momentum and energy in the team, I\u2019m looking forward to going to work, you almost have to push people out (of the factory) to go home, people looking at stuff, analyzing, trying to improve, it\u2019s really a pleasure to work for the team.\u201d\n\nAlonso believes a victory is possible in 2023 in the right circumstances.\n\n\u201cWe need some help from (Red Bull) but it will happen for them eventually when they cannot always finish first and second,\u201d he said. \u201cOne day it (could be) the pit stop, one day the gearbox, if Max had (in qualifying) in the race he\u2019s going to retire the car, so there\u2019s going to be some circuits that maybe reliability or whatever could help us and hopefully in those races we take the opportunity.\u201d\n\nEven if Aston Martin does slip behind Ferrari and/or Mercedes it is looking at worst a very good fourth in the championship and already has two podiums, which would far exceed its preseason targets.",

Bumping into people at the same coffee station, at the same toilets, you just rub shoulders with the people that you're working closely with.\n\nAston Martin Silverstone factory rendering Photo by: Aston Martin Racing\n\n\"At the moment, we're in different buildings, different sites even. It's going to be really good.\"\n\nAston Martin also has a new wind tunnel under construction, although this infrastructure upgrade is not set to be ready until 2025, a year behind rival McLaren's new facility.\n\nSince the outfit currently uses the Mercedes wind tunnel at Brackley, McCullough reckons \"extra flexibility\" will be one of the greatest virtues of the new configuration.\n\nHe explained: \"It's definitely better having it on-site. Having your own wind tunnel means that within the [Aerodynamic Testing Restrictions] regulations, you can use it when you want to use it.\n\n\"If you have a problem or you learn something, you can just stop, go back, produce some new bits, think about something, go back and turn it on again.\n\n\"It gives you that extra flexibility. You can really operate seven days a week.\n\n\"At the moment, we've only got limited time in the tunnel that we're using so you have to be very intense and you can't react too much.\n\n\"Also, on-site, if there's any problems, the people who are drawing the parts are just in the building next to you. It's definitely going to help with communication.\"",

He became World Endurance Champion with Toyota, took the checkered flag in the 24 Hours of Daytona, and he won one of the most prestigious races in the world, the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Twice.\n\nDespite his strong start this season, it has been 10 years since Alonso, 41, last won a Grand Prix. Max Verstappen of Red Bull, the reigning two-time champion who leads this year\u2019s title race, would like to see Alonso win again.",

Even when things took a turn, the two weren&#8217;t highly critical or placing blame for a team mistake. Sainz and Leclerc most recently defended the Prancing Horse against the latest round of media reports of turmoil earlier this month.</p><p>During the 2022 Italian Grand Prix weekend, former team principal Mattia Binotto discussed just how involved the two drivers are with the team, which shows their level of commitment. When asked what reassurances he offered his drivers, Binotto responded with quite the list.</p><p>Binotto detailed how Sainz and Leclerc are involved in &#8220;our process of improvement,&#8221; post-race conversations, &#8220;real-time during the race weekend, whatever we are doing so on the strategies,&#8221; and race conversations. Binotto added, &#8220;I think being so involved, they are part of it, and they are even protagonists, so it&#8217;s not a matter of giving them assurances. It&#8217;s a matter of keeping them involved, making sure that the team is capable of improving, giving them the full support to do so, and keep the confidence in what we are doing.&#8221;</p><p>Regarding getting along with one another, Leclerc and Sainz are close in age at 25 and 28 years old, respectively, and reasonably competitive (have you seen the C2 videos?). They seem to have a strong teammate bond on and off track (throwback to their chess matches).</p><p>While this question is focused on the driver dynamics, it&#8217;s also helpful to point out the culture within Ferrari now that a new team boss is in town. Fred Vasseur made it clear before the season started, &#8220;We will have the capacity to provide them exactly the same car and the same structure and the same support. The target is to win with Ferrari and for Ferrari. There will be no number one or number two. But if at one stage, we have to take action, I will take action.&#8221; &#8212; Madeline Coleman</p><h2>Tire blankets explainer</h2><p><strong>Why do put crew members keep the tires covered until the very last moment in the garage and on the starting grid? &#8212; Aaron Q.</strong></p><p>Tire blankets keep the tires as warm as possible &#8211; crucial to extracting peak performance from the Pirelli rubber. Warmer tires provide better grip. The tires are warmed to 70&#186; C (158&#186; F), meaning every last second you can keep them on and keep heat in the tires will benefit the drivers when they head out initially. That&#8217;s why the final team members on the starting grid hold the tire warmers, taking them off right before the formation lap. The drivers will then try to keep heat in the tires by weaving around the track, but there is a natural drop before they get to racing speeds.</p><p class=\"ad-slug\">Advertisement</p><p id=\"mid4\" class=\"ad place-ad\"></p><p>Tire warmers are actually a big topic of conversation in F1 right now.

            "text": "But while it ultimately missed out on beating its rival on countback, even getting in that battle was impressive considering how challenging the start of its year had been.\n\nThe 2022 campaign proved to be a down-and-up season for the British marque, as it abandoned its launch sidepod concept design early on after being unable to get the performance out of it that it had hoped for.\n\nHere we look back at its tech progress, from the AMR22 launch concept to the mid-season revamp and its later upgrades.\n\nAston Martin front comparison\n\nAston Martin's first interpretation of the 2022 regulations saw the team adopt a high waisted, completely undercut sidepod solution, with a square inlet and a slew of cooling gills along the bodywork's back.\n\nAston Martin AMR22 double T tray detail Photo by: Aston Martin Racing\n\nAs seen in the launch images, Aston Martin was the first team to install a bib wing on its car, a solution we saw a great deal of teams adopt throughout the course of 2022.\n\nAston Martin AMR22 new caliper Photo by: Giorgio Piola\n\nAston Martin opted to mount its front brake caliper at the front of the assembly for 2022, with the caliper designed to allow heat rejected by the disc a pathway between it and the brake drum.\n\nAston Martin AMR22 brake drum detail Photo by: Uncredited\n\nThe brake caliper with the carbon shroud in place that also feeds cool air around the caliper.\n\nAston Martin AMR22 wing mirrors detail Photo by: Aston Martin\n\nA change in the design of the mirror housing and stalks was swiftly made, as the team looked to use their presence as a way of boosting aerodynamic performance.\n\nAston Martin AMR22 Comparison Photo by: Uncredited\n\nThe first race of the season saw the team make modifications to the sidepods, with the squared-off lower corner of the inlet replaced with one with less radius (red arrow), which not only impacts flow into the inlet but also around the bodywork's undercut.\n\nAston Martin AMR22 rear wing comparison Photo by: Uncredited\n\nAston Martin fitted the AMR22 with a much lower downforce rear wing for the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, with a deeper central portion and shallow outer portion creating a more aggressive spoon-shaped design than its higher downforce counterpart.\n\nAston Martin AMR22 rear wing comparison Photo by: Uncredited\n\nA third specification rear wing was unveiled for the Australian Grand Prix, sitting in the middle in terms of downforce levels of those already utilised. The wing was the first in its suite to feature more of a traditional mainplane, rather than the spoon-shaped ones that the new regulations are more suited for.\n\nAston Martin AMR22 floor comparison Photo by: Motorsport Images\n\nThe team revised the position of its floor stay at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in order that it offered the correct support to the floor under flexion.\n\nAston Martin AMR22 Halo winglets Photo by: Uncredited\n\nAston Martin had a variety of different solutions when it came to the winglets mounted on or around the halo. All of these help, in various ways, to redistribute flow around the car.\n\nAston Martin AMR22 new layout Photo by: Giorgio Piola\n\nThe AMR22 featured completely revamped bodywork from the Spanish Grand Prix onwards, with the team opting to follow in the footsteps of Red Bull and abandon its high-waisted sidepod solution.\n\nThe downwash ramp-style sidepod even featured the midriff sewage line and narrow, twisted cooling gill panel seen on the RB18.\n\nHowever, it was either unable or unwilling to completely assimilate the design as the inlet section of the sidepod remained squared-off, rather than taking the open top form seen on its rivals' cars.\n\nAston Martin AMR22 side detail Photo by: Giorgio Piola\n\nThe floor was also changed as part of the Spanish Grand Prix update package. And, much like the bodywork changes, was very similar to the design seen on the Red Bull. This included the marriage of the two outer floor fences, which had only been seen on the RB18 beforehand.\n\nLance Stroll, Aston Martin AMR22 Photo by: Zak Mauger / Motorsport Images\n\nThe team also ran a high downforce rear wing in Spain, which can be seen here with flo-viz applied in order that the team could get visual confirmation it was working as anticipated.\n\nAston Martin AMR22 engine\n\nA peek under the covers at the Canadian Grand Prix allows us to appreciate the way the team packaged the power unit within, including the placement of the radiators within the sidepod and the airbox ducting.\n\nAston Martin AMR22 rear wing Photo by: Uncredited\n\nAnother rear wing configuration was added to the growing number at its disposal too, as the team installed a new upper flap with a central section that was slightly taller than the tip section.\n\nAston Martin AMR22 brake duct detail Photo by: Giorgio Piola\n\nA cluster of fins was added to the inside of the brake duct fence at the British Grand Prix, as the team looked to improve both brake cooling and aerodynamic efficiency.\n\nAston Martin AMR22 rear brake Photo by: Giorgio Piola\n\nA look under the cover of the brake drum fairing at the rear of the AMR22 at the French Grand Prix, noting the pipework and shielding used to control the passage of cool air and deal with temperature transfer.\n\nAston Martin AMR22 bottom detail Photo by: Giorgio Piola\n\nAs the car is prepared for action and much of the bodywork remains unmounted, we're gifted a view of the bib section, with the main stay at the front and the sprung mechanism mounted in behind.\n\nAston Martin AMR22 rear wing Photo by: Giorgio Piola\n\nFlo-viz painted on the rear wing gives the team visual confirmation of the airflow's passage over the assembly.\n\nAston Martin AMR22 rear wing detail Photo by: Giorgio Piola\n\nAston Martin unveiled a rear wing design in Hungary that defied the intention of the regulations and created a faux version of the more familiar full-height endplate design we've seen before. This clever interpretation circumvented the regulations but required the surfaces to be rolled over in a very specific way to do so.\n\nAston Martin AMR 22 2023 mirrors Photo by: Giorgio Piola\n\nAston Martin created an enlarged version of its regular mirror body and stay design for the group test that the teams conducted at the Dutch Grand Prix in preparation for 2023. An extra vertical baffle was added when compared with the regular design, in order to help divert the airflow's passage more effectively.\n\nAston Martin AMR22 rear wing detail Photo by: Giorgio Piola\n\nFirst seen in Belgium, but not raced until Italy, this rear wing iteration was not only the most radical design seen at Aston Martin but perhaps the entire grid.

There are simulation facilities and so on that are also going to come online. &#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Does that stop us progressing in the way that we want? Absolutely not. But are they key for us as a sustained performance gains in the future? Absolutely, and that&#8217;s what we need to push for.&#8221;&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><h2>The right staff</h2>\n<img src=\"//cdn-4.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0ZRJpKN0/s8/the-aston-martin-garage-1.jpg\" alt=\"The Aston Martin garage\">\n<p class=\"title\">The Aston Martin garage</p>\n<p class=\"photographer\">Photo by: Steven Tee / <a href=\"https://www.motorsportimages.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Motorsport Images</a></p>\n<p>If there is one thing that has been obvious since&#160;Aston&#160;Martin&#160;owner Lawrence Stroll took charge at the team it is that he has made a push to chase the best of everything.&#160;</p>\n<p>As well as investing heavily in facilities, he has also been super aggressive in making sure he has the right people in place to move the team forward.&#160;</p>\n<p>That is why Stroll has left no stone unturned when it has come to attracting the very best people he can get on board &#8211; even if it has meant digging deep into his pockets and ruffling a few feathers at other teams.&#160;</p>\n<p>As he said at his launch: \"The passion comes from excitement. When I get excited about something I get very passionate, and when I get very passionate, I win!\"&#160;</p>\n<p>The end result is a number of high-profile captures including TD Fallows from Red Bull,&#160;deputy technical director Eric Blandin from Mercedes and former McLaren, Toro Rosso, Manor and Sauber man Luca Furbatto.&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>All of them have fantastic knowledge of exactly what effort and focus is needed to be successful at the very front of F1.&#160;</p>\n<h2>The right mindset</h2>\n<img src=\"//cdn-9.motorsport.com/images/mgl/68yPPzl0/s8/lawrence-stroll-1.jpg\" alt=\"Lawrence Stroll\">\n<p class=\"title\">Lawrence Stroll</p>\n<p class=\"photographer\">Photo by: Erik Junius</p>\n<p>The right infrastructure and right staff ultimately mean nothing if the team does not have the right attitude.&#160;</p>\n<p>And there is a clear sense within&#160;Aston&#160;Martin&#160;that it is ready to be a bit of a disruptor and do things its own way in the quest to win.&#160;</p>\n<p>It has never been a team that has been wedded to convention; whether in taking customer parts (like the Mercedes gearbox and rear suspension it buys right now) or aggressively pursuing concepts that others have thought up first.&#160;</p>\n<p>Some rivals have been locked in to the belief that the only way to win is to design and build every component yourself; but that&#8217;s not something&#160;Aston&#160;Martin&#160;is so convinced about.&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>&#8220;Honestly, it hasn&#8217;t been a handicap for us at all, having their parts,&#8221; explained Fallows about the use of Mercedes components.&#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If anything, it&#8217;s been a big boost for us. They clearly do their own development.&#160; We have to be able to put our aerodynamic surfaces on their rear suspension as well, so it&#8217;s not entirely theirs from an aerodynamic point of view.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n<p>Beyond that, there is also the willingness to be open to the potential that other teams have come up with better ideas than yourself.&#160;</p>\n<p>When&#160;Aston&#160;Martin&#160;started 2022 with the wrong car concept, it wasted little time in changing approach and switching to the Red Bull solution from the Spanish Grand Prix.&#160;</p>\n<p>And, with it pretty clear in F1 that Red Bull&#8217;s downwash design may be the best route for success in the ground effect era,&#160;Aston&#160;Martin&#160;has committed to it and added its own style too &#8211; rather than thinking it could come up with something better from scratch.&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>It was telling at the team launch earlier this year that Fallows spoke openly that one of tech genius Adrian Newey&#8217;s great strengths in F1 was not shutting himself off to other people&#8217;s ideas.&#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think one of the things that I&#8217;ve really enjoyed with him is that he lacks any kind of technical arrogance about him,&#8221; he said. &#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s very open to being told about things that he&#8217;s stipulated or things that he&#8217;s suggested that they haven't worked or there are better ideas out there. And that almost irrespective of where those comments come from. &#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s something I definitely try to bring into my own work. What I very much encourage a lot of the technical team to do is to be open minded. Even if you have very clear visions about how you want to develop things, or very clear ideas about the car, make sure you&#8217;re not technically arrogant about it.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n<h2>The Alonso factor</h2>\n<img src=\"//cdn-8.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2y319we6/s8/fernando-alonso-aston-martin-f-1.jpg\" alt=\"Fernando Alonso, Aston Martin F1 Team, 3rd position, lifts his trophy on the podium\">\n<p class=\"title\">Fernando Alonso, Aston Martin F1 Team, 3rd position, lifts his trophy on the podium</p>\n<p class=\"photographer\">Photo by: Andy Hone / <a href=\"https://www.motorsportimages.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Motorsport Images</a></p>\n<p>One element that also cannot be ignored is the boost the team has taken from the signing of <a href=\"https://www.motorsport.com/driver/fernando-alonso/489/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fernando Alonso</a>.&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>It was interesting to hear new <a href=\"https://www.motorsport.com/team/williams/13/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Williams</a> team boss James Vowles single out the impact of Alonso as his first explanation for the leap&#160;Aston&#160;Martin&#160;had made in 2023.&#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think they have an extraordinary driver who's in the car,&#8221; he said.&#160;</p>\n<p>There are two critical factors that are important for teams when it comes to capitalising on the gains to be had from signing one of the grid&#8217;s undisputed best.&#160;</p>\n<p>First, there is the automatic lap time benefit that comes out on track, as the two-time world champion should be able to deliver a few tenths of a second just from taking the car to the limit.&#160;</p>\n<p>Then beyond that there is the belief and motivation that having someone like Alonso on board can produce for the organisation itself.&#160;</p>\n<p>Staff will be willing to go that extra mile, and dig just that little bit deeper, knowing that there is the prospect of ever greater rewards on track now.&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>It is clear that there is not one silver bullet that has been key for&#160;Aston&#160;Martin&#160;making the leap it has.&#160;</p>\n<p>Instead, it is a combination of easily explainable factors that have come together to help it fast track momentum towards the front of the grid.&#160;</p>\n<p>And, as Alonso quite rightly pointed out after Bahrain, there is nothing the team has done that rivals could not have pursued themselves.&#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think you need to have the vision and the ambition of Lawrence Stroll, or our leadership and our management because the opportunities are there for everybody,&#8221; he said.&#160;&#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But it seems that only one team is willing to do whatever it takes to win.

Absolutely, and that\u2019s what we need to push for.\u201d\n\nThe right staff\n\nThe Aston Martin garage Photo by: Steven Tee / Motorsport Images\n\nIf there is one thing that has been obvious since Aston Martin owner Lawrence Stroll took charge at the team it is that he has made a push to chase the best of everything.\n\nAs well as investing heavily in facilities, he has also been super aggressive in making sure he has the right people in place to move the team forward.\n\nThat is why Stroll has left no stone unturned when it has come to attracting the very best people he can get on board \u2013 even if it has meant digging deep into his pockets and ruffling a few feathers at other teams.\n\nAs he said at his launch: \"The passion comes from excitement. When I get excited about something I get very passionate, and when I get very passionate, I win!\"\n\nThe end result is a number of high-profile captures including TD Fallows from Red Bull, deputy technical director Eric Blandin from Mercedes and former McLaren, Toro Rosso, Manor and Sauber man Luca Furbatto.\n\nAll of them have fantastic knowledge of exactly what effort and focus is needed to be successful at the very front of F1.\n\nThe right mindset\n\nLawrence Stroll Photo by: Erik Junius\n\nThe right infrastructure and right staff ultimately mean nothing if the team does not have the right attitude.\n\nAnd there is a clear sense within Aston Martin that it is ready to be a bit of a disruptor and do things its own way in the quest to win.\n\nIt has never been a team that has been wedded to convention; whether in taking customer parts (like the Mercedes gearbox and rear suspension it buys right now) or aggressively pursuing concepts that others have thought up first.\n\nSome rivals have been locked in to the belief that the only way to win is to design and build every component yourself; but that\u2019s not something Aston Martin is so convinced about.\n\n\u201cHonestly, it hasn\u2019t been a handicap for us at all, having their parts,\u201d explained Fallows about the use of Mercedes components.\n\n\u201cIf anything, it\u2019s been a big boost for us. They clearly do their own development. We have to be able to put our aerodynamic surfaces on their rear suspension as well, so it\u2019s not entirely theirs from an aerodynamic point of view.\u201d\n\nBeyond that, there is also the willingness to be open to the potential that other teams have come up with better ideas than yourself.\n\nWhen Aston Martin started 2022 with the wrong car concept, it wasted little time in changing approach and switching to the Red Bull solution from the Spanish Grand Prix.\n\nAnd, with it pretty clear in F1 that Red Bull\u2019s downwash design may be the best route for success in the ground effect era, Aston Martin has committed to it and added its own style too \u2013 rather than thinking it could come up with something better from scratch.\n\nIt was telling at the team launch earlier this year that Fallows spoke openly that one of tech genius Adrian Newey\u2019s great strengths in F1 was not shutting himself off to other people\u2019s ideas.\n\n\u201cI think one of the things that I\u2019ve really enjoyed with him is that he lacks any kind of technical arrogance about him,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very open to being told about things that he\u2019s stipulated or things that he\u2019s suggested that they haven't worked or there are better ideas out there. And that almost irrespective of where those comments come from.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s something I definitely try to bring into my own work. What I very much encourage a lot of the technical team to do is to be open minded. Even if you have very clear visions about how you want to develop things, or very clear ideas about the car, make sure you\u2019re not technically arrogant about it.\u201d\n\nThe Alonso factor\n\nFernando Alonso, Aston Martin F1 Team, 3rd position, lifts his trophy on the podium Photo by: Andy Hone / Motorsport Images\n\nOne element that also cannot be ignored is the boost the team has taken from the signing of Fernando Alonso.\n\nIt was interesting to hear new Williams team boss James Vowles single out the impact of Alonso as his first explanation for the leap Aston Martin had made in 2023.\n\n\u201cI think they have an extraordinary driver who's in the car,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are two critical factors that are important for teams when it comes to capitalising on the gains to be had from signing one of the grid\u2019s undisputed best.\n\nFirst, there is the automatic lap time benefit that comes out on track, as the two-time world champion should be able to deliver a few tenths of a second just from taking the car to the limit.\n\nThen beyond that there is the belief and motivation that having someone like Alonso on board can produce for the organisation itself.\n\nStaff will be willing to go that extra mile, and dig just that little bit deeper, knowing that there is the prospect of ever greater rewards on track now.\n\nIt is clear that there is not one silver bullet that has been key for Aston Martin making the leap it has.\n\nInstead, it is a combination of easily explainable factors that have come together to help it fast track momentum towards the front of the grid.\n\nAnd, as Alonso quite rightly pointed out after Bahrain, there is nothing the team has done that rivals could not have pursued themselves.\n\n\u201cI think you need to have the vision and the ambition of Lawrence Stroll, or our leadership and our management because the opportunities are there for everybody,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut it seems that only one team is willing to do whatever it takes to win. And I'm proud to be part of this organisation.\u201d",

It\u2019s possible.\n\n\u201cI would not go as far as saying a common gearbox for everybody or same gearbox for everybody, but design specification or stuff like that, just to cut the cost down.\u201d\n\nHonda deal makes Aston Martin\u2019s grand F1 goals plausible Read more\n\nAston Martin is already working on building up a gearbox design capacity. Its last in-house gearbox was produced in 2008, when it introduced a seamless-shift system with a mid-season upgrade.\n\nKrack indicated the team does not intend to make an in-house gearbox before \u201926 given it has a Mercedes contract that stretches to the end of \u201925 and the cost cap implications. But he is confident it will be ready for \u201926, the first year with Honda.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a gearbox at the moment,\u201d said Krack. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge [to be able to produce one], we are aware of that.\n\n\u201cBut we are moving into the new building \u2013 over this weekend, it starts. And we have all the provision there to build our own gearboxes.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that is a challenge but I think over the next month, we will set up ourselves to be able to do that and then we should be ready by 2026.\u201d",

            "article_html": "<div><p>Aston Martin is currently still working from the original Jordan factory that was first used in 1991, with many employees located in a temporary stack of cabins alongside the main building and the wind tunnel staff working at the Mercedes facility in Brackley.</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>The new facility that is being built alongside its existing base will see everyone in one building, with the entire design department in a large open-plan office. It will be ready in May, with the nearby wind tunnel opening in 2024.</p>\n<p>\"The fact that you can talk to people without having to arrange meetings, it facilitates the dialogue massively,\" said Krack, when asked if he agreed that the new building would be a game changer.</p>\n<p>\"The remote locations that we have, so you either need to pick up the phone or organise something, sometimes this is a natural barrier of more exchange.</p>\n<p>\"And the other thing is also logistics, we should not forget to bring things from left to right or A to B, it will be massively different and massively easier. From that point of view, I fully agree with using the word game changer, for team dynamics and logistics.\"</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>Technical director Dan Fallows stressed an open plan design office would make a big difference to internal communications.</p>\n<img src=\"//cdn-5.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2Qz5pgmY/s8/aston-martin-silverstone-facto-1.jpg\" alt=\"Aston Martin Silverstone factory tour\">\n<p class=\"title\">Aston Martin Silverstone factory tour</p>\n<p class=\"photographer\">Photo by: Dom Romney / <a href=\"https://www.motorsportimages.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Motorsport Images</a></p>\n<p>\"I think it'll change it significantly,\" he said. \"We've got this small factory here and these modular buildings where we have some people who are not necessarily designing parts of the car at the moment, but they are very connected to our design process, and having them not in the same room makes it slightly more difficult to communicate with them.</p>\n<p>\"I've been in a big, open-plan office before with the ability to be able to walk around and talk to people very easily, and it makes a huge difference in terms of those interactions.</p>\n<p>\"Particularly those serendipitous interactions where you can have a chat with somebody about one thing and go on to lots of other things, and they often end up being the most creative conversations. That's what we're trying to build.\"</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>Fallows also noted the new building will contribute to cost savings: \"It will for sure.

It will be ready in May, with the nearby wind tunnel opening in 2024.\n\n\"The fact that you can talk to people without having to arrange meetings, it facilitates the dialogue massively,\" said Krack, when asked if he agreed that the new building would be a game changer.\n\n\"The remote locations that we have, so you either need to pick up the phone or organise something, sometimes this is a natural barrier of more exchange.\n\n\"And the other thing is also logistics, we should not forget to bring things from left to right or A to B, it will be massively different and massively easier.

That's what we're trying to build.\"\n\nFallows also noted the new building will contribute to cost savings: \"It will for sure.

OBITUARY: Mauro Forghieri, technical genius behind some of Formula 1\u2019s greatest Ferraris, remembered A similar feat was achieved by the Scuderia later in the decade when, having again dropped to sixth in 1973 with just 12 points to their name, an updated 312 B3-74 \u2013 driven by the up-and-coming Niki Lauda and Regazzoni \u2013 brought the team back into contention through 1974, paving the way for a run of titles from 1975-77.\n\nJacky Ickx collected three of Ferrari\u2019s four race victories in 1970\n\nMcLaren \u2013 1972 1971 season: 6th in the standings / 10 points\n\n1972 season: 3rd in the standings / 1 win / 47 points Having finished as runners-up in only their third F1 season in 1968, McLaren had to make do with a sole victory and sporadic podiums from 1969-1971 \u2013 another title assault alluding them as Tyrrell, BRM, Ferrari, March and Lotus all slotted ahead. But the 1972 campaign would mark a turning point with a rapid ascent up the order thanks to the M19A and its pear-shaped cockpit sides that earned the \u2018Alligator Car\u2019 nickname. A win in race two and consistent podiums took McLaren from sixth to third in the standings, which they would repeat the following year.

After a lean spell in the mid-1970s, the team vaulted to the front of the grid once more via the revolutionary Lotus 78. This was the first ground effect car to compete in F1, offering grip levels that had never seen before, while starting a new trend amongst teams who could afford to emulate the technology. TECH TUESDAY: The Lotus 79, F1\u2019s ground effect marvel One win towards the end of 1976 was trounced by five with Mario Andretti and Gunnar Nilsson when the all-new car arrived in 1977, more than doubling their points tally.

The team\u2019s point-less debut 1977 season was followed up by a modest tally of 11 in 1978, and any hopes of fighting at the front appeared to be a long way off. But team founder Frank Williams and technical sidekick Patrick Head had other ideas.

But the difference between the MP4/3 and MP4/4, and the MP4/4 and the rest of the F1 field, was simply astounding. One of McLaren\u2019s most sophisticated designs, works Honda power, a new driver pairing of Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna\u2026 All the ingredients came together for what statistically remains the most dominant season in F1 history. BEYOND THE GRID: Steve Nichols on creating the most dominant F1 car of all time With pole position and victory at all bar one of the 16 events held that season, McLaren finished a whopping 134 points clear of the competition, leaving Senna and Prost free to battle it out between themselves for the drivers\u2019 title.\n\nMcLaren delivered an utterly dominant season with the MP4/4\n\nMcLaren \u2013 1998 1997 season: 4th in the standings / 3 wins / 63 points\n\n1998 season: Champions / 9 wins / 156 points Some 10 years on from that season of all seasons, and their Honda-powered success now firmly a thing of the past, McLaren found themselves trying to reclaim lost performance as the 1990s wore on, having placed a distant fourth overall in every season from 1994-1997. LIGHTS TO FLAG: Coulthard on replacing Senna, dealing with Ron Dennis, and racing against Hakkinen However, after poaching design genius Adrian Newey from Williams, the MP4/13 brought McLaren into contention again. Mika Hakkinen came out on top in a season-long scrap with Ferrari rival Michael Schumacher to win the drivers\u2019 title, while McLaren put their hands back on the constructors\u2019 trophy \u2013 their first since 1991 in both categories.\n\nAdrian Newey helped McLaren return to competitive shape in the late-1990s\n\nBAR Honda \u2013 2004 2003 season: 5th in the standings / 26 points\n\n2004 season: 2nd in the standings / 119 points BAR endured a torrid first season in F1 as they ended the 1999 campaign without a point and with a host of retirements behind them, but a Honda engine tie-up for 2000 and beyond offered plenty of hope \u2013 their first points and podiums soon arriving. BARRETTO: Are Honda poised for another return to F1? After that initial upturn in performance, BAR were stuck in the \u2018occasional points-scorers\u2019 bracket until 2004, when they rose from fifth to second position with the much-improved 006 machine \u2013 Jenson Button notching up 10 podiums and team mate Takuma Sato adding another.\n\nJenson Button and BAR Honda filled their trophy cabinet during the 2004 campaign\n\nBMW Sauber \u2013 2007 2006 season: 5th in the standings / 36 points\n\n2007 season: 2nd in the standings / 101 points Sauber were another team to benefit from the signing of a works engine deal in the mid-2000s after BMW moved over from rivals Williams \u2013 a partnership that saw the long-time midfield runners powered towards the front of the field. BEYOND THE GRID: Listen to Nick Heidfeld discuss his fastest team mates, his toughest rivals and the best F1 car he drove With a best tally of 34 points across 13 years as an independent team, the rebranded BMW Sauber and the new F1.07 smashed that total by scoring 101 throughout 2007, while Nick Heidfeld finished an eye-catching second to McLaren\u2019s Lewis Hamilton at the Canadian Grand Prix.\n\nSauber became a front-running force when they linked up with BMW\n\nRed Bull \u2013 2009 2008 season: 7th in the standings / 29 points\n\n2009 season: 2nd in the standings / 6 wins / 153.5 points With McLaren previously benefitting from Newey\u2019s services, Red Bull did the same by taking him from Woking to Milton Keynes over the winter of 2005. And, after a few seasons settling into his new surroundings, the 2009 rules reset presented a golden opportunity. Although Brawn GP made the headlines (more on them in a moment), Red Bull enjoyed an impressive rise of their own as they went from seventh in the constructors\u2019 standings \u2013 with solid points finishes and the odd podium \u2013 all the way up to second. READ MORE: Horner addresses speculation over Newey\u2019s future as he insists tech guru will be at Red Bull \u2018for many years to come\u2019 While they missed out on the title, Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber combined to give the team six race wins and 10 further podiums, with four successive double title-winning seasons following from 2010 to 2013.\n\nRed Bull put the pressure on headline-makers Brawn GP as the 2009 season developed\n\nBrawn GP \u2013 2009 2008 season: 9th in the standings / 14 points (as Honda)\n\n2009 season: Champions / 8 wins / 172 points As touched on above, Brawn GP took the F1 paddock by storm in 2009, rising from the ashes of the terminated factory Honda team that initially left Button and Rubens Barrichello without race seats and team members fearing for their jobs. Eponymous leader Ross Brawn and fellow chief Nick Fry worked wonders over the winter to keep the organisation in the sport under their new name and, in what felt like a Hollywood movie, the \u2018double diffuser\u2019 BGP 001 \u2013 with a Mercedes engine squeezed in \u2013 emerged as the class of the field under sweeping regulation changes. BEYOND THE GRID: Brawn GP engineers \u2018thought we\u2019d got our sums wrongs\u2019 ahead of fairytale start to 2009 season Button led Barrichello home in a sensational one-two finish at the season opener in Australia, going on to rack up six wins from the first seven races and later fending off his team mate and the ever-improving Red Bull to seal the deal. With both titles in the bank, Brawn GP were acquired by Mercedes for the 2010 campaign.\n\nBrawn GP wrote a fairy-tale story with their 2009 performance\n\nMercedes \u2013 2014 2013 season: 2nd in the standings / 3 wins / 360 points\n\n2014 season: Champions / 16 wins / 701 points After taking over the Brawn GP entry and steadily building up speed, Mercedes logged the first victories of their F1 comeback in 2012 and 2013, climbing to second in the championship standings behind Red Bull during the latter season. But with major rule changes on the way for 2014, centred around turbo-hybrid power units, Mercedes did their due diligence to hit the ground running and blow away the competition \u2013 leaving Hamilton and Nico Rosberg in a title fight of their own out front. READ MORE: Doing the double \u2013 Hamilton\u2019s route to the 2014 title Winning 16 of the 19 races staged, Mercedes finished on 701 points and almost 300 clear of their closest rivals, while supplied team Williams made a noteworthy jump from ninth to third. But the Silver Arrows did not stop there. Drivers\u2019 titles followed in every season through 2020, and constructors\u2019 titles in every season through 2021, for a scarcely believable record.\n\nMercedes stole a march on their rivals as F1\u2019s turbo-hybrid era began\n\nFerrari \u2013 2022 2021 season: 3rd in the standings / 323.5 points\n\n2022 season: 2nd in the standings / 4 wins / 554 points After pushing champions Mercedes in 2019, Ferrari slumped to sixth in the 2020 rankings to mark their worst result since the 1980 season, with the celebratory SF1000 \u2013 commemorating the team\u2019s 1000th Grand Prix entry \u2013 failing to deliver on track. While 2021 marked a solid improvement, Ferrari were still far away from their title-challenging ambitions and instead opted to focus their attentions on the 2022 \u2018ground effect\u2019 rule changes, a decision that paid off handsomely to begin with.

But success initially proved hard to come by, with the team logging successive P7 finishes in the constructors\u2019 standings. However, with Stroll\u2019s ambitious plans, plenty of investment, a restructured technical department led by former Red Bull man Dan Fallows and two-time champion Fernando Alonso arriving from Alpine, that all changed in 2023, as Aston Martin went from \u2018also rans\u2019 to podium contenders in a flash.

            "title": "INSIGHT: How Aston Martin made the leap from F1\u2019s midfield",
            "article_html": "<div><p>Aston Martin is ahead of schedule. The team has never hidden its ambition, with owner Lawrence Stroll recently stating the objective is to become &#8220;one of the greatest Formula 1 teams there will be,&#8221; but in season three of a five-year plan to emerge as a front-runner it has, based on the Bahrain Grand Prix weekend, the second-best car in F1.</p>\n<p>Realistically, it&#8217;s going to struggle to stay in second place given the Ferrari did look quicker on a weekend where its performance was contained by tire degradation troubles. That proved to be one of the many strengths of the Aston Martin AMR23 in Bahrain, allowing Fernando Alonso to climb from seventh after a difficult first lap to third.</p>\n<p>Although Charles Leclerc&#8217;s Ferrari power unit letting him down promoted Alonso to the podium, had the Spaniard not lost ground early one &#8212; partly thanks to a clout from teammate Lance Stroll at Turn 4 &#8212; there&#8217;s every chance he could have taken that position on merit. It will require more races to judge Aston Martin&#8217;s true performance given the abrasive Bahrain surface means race pace is dramatically contained and even qualifying pace is more compromised than usual in terms of setup. But what is clear is that it has broken free of the midfield and joined the lead group.</p>\n<p>Vast resources have been poured into Aston Martin since a consortium led by Stroll Sr. bought the Force India team after it fell into administration in the summer of 2018. While a &#8220;new&#8221; entrant for paperwork reasons, it&#8217;s exactly the same team that consistently produced giant-killing feats in both its Jordan and Force India guises. After an interregnum as Racing Point, during which Sergio Perez won the 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix driving the infamous &#8220;Pink Mercedes,&#8221; largely a clone &#8212; and a legal one &#8212; of the previous-year&#8217;s title-winning car, it became Aston Martin in 2021.</p>\n<p>Results were patchy in the first two years of Aston Martin, which is broadly in keeping with the history of the marque in F1. Its short-lived works team in 1959-60 achieved little with a car, the DBR4, that could have been competitive were it raced when first built in 1957 but that was a front-engined relic when it finally debuted. Sebastian Vettel took a podium finish in Baku in &#8217;21, but last season was a difficult one after getting the initial car concept wrong. But there were signs of what the team was capable of as it surged to the brink of recovering to sixth place in the constructors&#8217; championship after major car revisions.</p>\n<p>During recent years, the team has grown from 400 to over 700 and recruited high-quality personnel from every corner of the F1 paddock. That includes technical director Dan Fallows, who worked under Adrian Newey in key aero roles at Red Bull previously, and his deputy Eric Blandin, formerly Mercedes head of aero. This increased the team&#8217;s performance potential significantly, so why is it a surprise it has become so good, so soon?</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s partly because the team still occupies the bursting-at-the-seams Silverstone facility that Jordan established back in 1992. That is being corrected with a purpose-built factory close to completion adjacent to it that the team is due to move into in May. It&#8217;s touted as F1&#8217;s first &#8220;smart factory&#8221; and &#8220;a game changer&#8221; and has been optimized around the team size and structure permitted by F1&#8217;s cost cap. The main building is one of three being constructed, but the one containing the new state-of-the-art wind tunnel is still a work in progress. That will be operational next year.</p>\n<p>Even though Aston Martin currently shares the Mercedes wind tunnel, along with the same power unit, gearbox, rear suspension and hydraulics, all of this puts a ceiling on its ultimate potential. Aston Martin is still a team evolving, but what is most remarkable is that it appears to have retained its historical knack for overachieving even while growing. The ability to fuse that greater resource in terms of people and budget with that tendency is one of the reasons Fallows cites for expectations being high internally heading into this season.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fortunate enough to have relatively recent experience of a top team and how that operates,&#8221; said Fallows during the Bahrain GP weekend. &#8220;But it&#8217;s sometimes very difficult for the midfield teams to compete on every level that the top teams have, particularly in things like facilities and tools.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So it is incredibly important to try to focus on the strengths that you have and try to make the differences where those are. In the case of Aston Martin, I think (that&#8217;s) the people that have been there for quite a long time, but (also) the team that&#8217;s developed over that is a big strength of ours.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got an incredibly talented and passionate team around us that has shown over the previous years that it can punch above its weight. So we need to lean on that. That&#8217;s something that we can hopefully stand out with.&#8221;</p>\n<p>By producing such a strong car, Aston Martin has shattered perceptions of what a midfield team can achieve. In recent times, the chasm between the &#8220;big three&#8221; teams and the rest appeared to have become ossified. While measures such as the cost cap, aerodynamic testing regulations that give more wind tunnel and CFD time to lower-ranked teams and the more equitable distribution of the share of F1&#8217;s revenue split between the teams have made a difference, this was felt to be a slow-burn in terms of impact.</p>\n<p>Aston Martin is one of a strong group of midfield teams of recent times that is aspiring to get to the front, but its timescale seems to be different. Alpine is satisfied still to be at the front of the midfield group this year, while McLaren has always talked of waiting for its new wind tunnel coming online and having time to make an impact, along with other major infrastructure upgrades, before it can hope to thrust forward. Alfa Romeo, too, is one of these teams but one coming from the lowest base and in the process of transitioning into being the works Audi team.</p>\n<p>So how has Aston Martin achieved this? Well, it hasn&#8217;t done it simply by copying Red Bull. There have been plenty of jibes about it producing a &#8220;green Red Bull,&#8221; with Sergio Perez joking there were three Red Bulls on the podium in Bahrain. It&#8217;s true that the car is very much similar to last year&#8217;s Red Bull concept, and therefore this year&#8217;s evolutionary version, but that&#8217;s true of many cars on the F1 grid. But it&#8217;s not a direct attempt to recreate a rival&#8217;s car, as the 2020 Racing Point was. A glance at the detail of the car shows plenty of differences. The idea Fallows turned up with a Red Bull design in his head and has made Aston Martin build it is a fatuous one.</p>\n<p>One advantage Aston Martin does have is that it uses the full Mercedes rear end. This comes at a price, not only in terms of design opportunity (your rear suspension geometry is fixed by another team) but also the cost. That&#8217;s not just what Aston Martin actually pays Mercedes but also the high notional value under the cost cap. Fallows has been equivocal on this, but there&#8217;s little doubt Aston Martin will eventually switch to produce its own such parts down the line simply because it is more efficient cost-cap and freer-design wise. McLaren and Alpine already do this, while Alfa Romeo uses Ferrari gearbox internals but designs its own casing primarily for cost cap reasons.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s not enough to explain the difference in performance as it&#8217;s absurd to suppose when Aston Martin does eventually make its own gearbox and rear suspension that it will flatline performance wise. That hints that this is a team that, even when crammed into an obsolete factory, is working very well in terms of its design and development programs.</p>\n<p>Under the most restrictive set of regulations in F1 history, the key to producing such a strong car is in understanding the key drivers of performance and where the potential is to maximize them. This is something Newey has always excelled at and is perhaps a trait Fallows shares thanks to his Red Bull years. It&#8217;s obvious that the underfloor is the key performance driver, but it&#8217;s the details around it &#8212; the floor fences, the way airflow is distributed between the venturi tunnels and the exterior of the car, the way this all interacts with the rest of the airflow regime of the car &#8212; that makes the difference. What Aston Martin has proved is that it has taken a leap in terms of understanding how to make the most of all of this.</p>\n<p>However, there is one question mark that hangs over Aston Martin. The current car is the product of a melange of individuals who have come in from multiple teams. They can&#8217;t bring designs with them, but collectively they offer a vast amount of knowledge and ideas, meaning that you could argue the current Aston Martin is a Red Bull concept with the knowledge from other teams sprinkled over it. It will have to prove it can come up with such prolific ideas independently in future. But that&#8217;s something the team likely will achieve.</p>\n<p>What it does show is that upwardly-mobile midfield teams can close on the deep knowledge built by the big-spending top squads over the past decade a little more quickly than they thought. And perhaps this is something that the team has taken wholesale from Red Bull, an ambition level that reflects not only the desire to match the biggest teams, but raise the bar for what is possible. That&#8217;s a key quality of genuine top F1 teams. Perhaps the most ominous warning came from Fallows late last year when he stressed the need to do things differently.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The important thing for us is to make sure that we don&#8217;t just replicate what our competitors are doing,&#8221; said Fallows. &#8220;We don&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s going to help us overtake the likes of Mercedes, Red Bull, Ferrari. So we have to develop our own way of doing things. That does take time, but we&#8217;ve got a hugely ambitious group of people.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Aston Martin AMR23 perhaps best embodies this. Yes, it follows Red Bull&#8217;s direction but it&#8217;s the team&#8217;s own take on that with plenty of differences and, the team hopes, some hidden secrets that will open up development potential over the coming three seasons. There&#8217;s also the extra edge of a team that is hinting that it&#8217;s not about staying where it is after this strong start, but actually closing the gap on Red Bull. That&#8217;s an aggressive mindset, one that stands the team in good stead.</p>\n<p>Prior to this year, Aston Martin has talked the talk and Stroll Sr. has put his money where his mouth is, not least with the recruitment of Alonso. But this year it&#8217;s walking the walk, for the first time proving that this is not just a team with the potential to change F1, but one that is now starting to show that it really can do so.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>",

That includes technical director Dan Fallows, who worked under Adrian Newey in key aero roles at Red Bull previously, and his deputy Eric Blandin, formerly Mercedes head of aero. This increased the team\u2019s performance potential significantly, so why is it a surprise it has become so good, so soon?\n\nIt\u2019s partly because the team still occupies the bursting-at-the-seams Silverstone facility that Jordan established back in 1992. That is being corrected with a purpose-built factory close to completion adjacent to it that the team is due to move into in May. It\u2019s touted as F1\u2019s first \u201csmart factory\u201d and \u201ca game changer\u201d and has been optimized around the team size and structure permitted by F1\u2019s cost cap. The main building is one of three being constructed, but the one containing the new state-of-the-art wind tunnel is still a work in progress. That will be operational next year.\n\nEven though Aston Martin currently shares the Mercedes wind tunnel, along with the same power unit, gearbox, rear suspension and hydraulics, all of this puts a ceiling on its ultimate potential. Aston Martin is still a team evolving, but what is most remarkable is that it appears to have retained its historical knack for overachieving even while growing. The ability to fuse that greater resource in terms of people and budget with that tendency is one of the reasons Fallows cites for expectations being high internally heading into this season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fortunate enough to have relatively recent experience of a top team and how that operates,\u201d said Fallows during the Bahrain GP weekend. \u201cBut it\u2019s sometimes very difficult for the midfield teams to compete on every level that the top teams have, particularly in things like facilities and tools.\n\n\u201cSo it is incredibly important to try to focus on the strengths that you have and try to make the differences where those are. In the case of Aston Martin, I think (that\u2019s) the people that have been there for quite a long time, but (also) the team that\u2019s developed over that is a big strength of ours.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got an incredibly talented and passionate team around us that has shown over the previous years that it can punch above its weight. So we need to lean on that. That\u2019s something that we can hopefully stand out with.\u201d\n\nBy producing such a strong car, Aston Martin has shattered perceptions of what a midfield team can achieve. In recent times, the chasm between the \u201cbig three\u201d teams and the rest appeared to have become ossified. While measures such as the cost cap, aerodynamic testing regulations that give more wind tunnel and CFD time to lower-ranked teams and the more equitable distribution of the share of F1\u2019s revenue split between the teams have made a difference, this was felt to be a slow-burn in terms of impact.\n\nAston Martin is one of a strong group of midfield teams of recent times that is aspiring to get to the front, but its timescale seems to be different. Alpine is satisfied still to be at the front of the midfield group this year, while McLaren has always talked of waiting for its new wind tunnel coming online and having time to make an impact, along with other major infrastructure upgrades, before it can hope to thrust forward. Alfa Romeo, too, is one of these teams but one coming from the lowest base and in the process of transitioning into being the works Audi team.\n\nSo how has Aston Martin achieved this? Well, it hasn\u2019t done it simply by copying Red Bull. There have been plenty of jibes about it producing a \u201cgreen Red Bull,\u201d with Sergio Perez joking there were three Red Bulls on the podium in Bahrain. It\u2019s true that the car is very much similar to last year\u2019s Red Bull concept, and therefore this year\u2019s evolutionary version, but that\u2019s true of many cars on the F1 grid. But it\u2019s not a direct attempt to recreate a rival\u2019s car, as the 2020 Racing Point was. A glance at the detail of the car shows plenty of differences. The idea Fallows turned up with a Red Bull design in his head and has made Aston Martin build it is a fatuous one.\n\nOne advantage Aston Martin does have is that it uses the full Mercedes rear end. This comes at a price, not only in terms of design opportunity (your rear suspension geometry is fixed by another team) but also the cost. That\u2019s not just what Aston Martin actually pays Mercedes but also the high notional value under the cost cap. Fallows has been equivocal on this, but there\u2019s little doubt Aston Martin will eventually switch to produce its own such parts down the line simply because it is more efficient cost-cap and freer-design wise. McLaren and Alpine already do this, while Alfa Romeo uses Ferrari gearbox internals but designs its own casing primarily for cost cap reasons.\n\nBut that\u2019s not enough to explain the difference in performance as it\u2019s absurd to suppose when Aston Martin does eventually make its own gearbox and rear suspension that it will flatline performance wise. That hints that this is a team that, even when crammed into an obsolete factory, is working very well in terms of its design and development programs.\n\nUnder the most restrictive set of regulations in F1 history, the key to producing such a strong car is in understanding the key drivers of performance and where the potential is to maximize them. This is something Newey has always excelled at and is perhaps a trait Fallows shares thanks to his Red Bull years. It\u2019s obvious that the underfloor is the key performance driver, but it\u2019s the details around it \u2014 the floor fences, the way airflow is distributed between the venturi tunnels and the exterior of the car, the way this all interacts with the rest of the airflow regime of the car \u2014 that makes the difference. What Aston Martin has proved is that it has taken a leap in terms of understanding how to make the most of all of this.\n\nHowever, there is one question mark that hangs over Aston Martin. The current car is the product of a melange of individuals who have come in from multiple teams. They can\u2019t bring designs with them, but collectively they offer a vast amount of knowledge and ideas, meaning that you could argue the current Aston Martin is a Red Bull concept with the knowledge from other teams sprinkled over it. It will have to prove it can come up with such prolific ideas independently in future. But that\u2019s something the team likely will achieve.\n\nWhat it does show is that upwardly-mobile midfield teams can close on the deep knowledge built by the big-spending top squads over the past decade a little more quickly than they thought. And perhaps this is something that the team has taken wholesale from Red Bull, an ambition level that reflects not only the desire to match the biggest teams, but raise the bar for what is possible. That\u2019s a key quality of genuine top F1 teams. Perhaps the most ominous warning came from Fallows late last year when he stressed the need to do things differently.\n\n\u201cThe important thing for us is to make sure that we don\u2019t just replicate what our competitors are doing,\u201d said Fallows. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that\u2019s going to help us overtake the likes of Mercedes, Red Bull, Ferrari. So we have to develop our own way of doing things. That does take time, but we\u2019ve got a hugely ambitious group of people.\u201d\n\nThe Aston Martin AMR23 perhaps best embodies this. Yes, it follows Red Bull\u2019s direction but it\u2019s the team\u2019s own take on that with plenty of differences and, the team hopes, some hidden secrets that will open up development potential over the coming three seasons. There\u2019s also the extra edge of a team that is hinting that it\u2019s not about staying where it is after this strong start, but actually closing the gap on Red Bull. That\u2019s an aggressive mindset, one that stands the team in good stead.\n\nPrior to this year, Aston Martin has talked the talk and Stroll Sr. has put his money where his mouth is, not least with the recruitment of Alonso. But this year it\u2019s walking the walk, for the first time proving that this is not just a team with the potential to change F1, but one that is now starting to show that it really can do so.",

            "text": "That possibility is one of the more intriguing stories to have emerged during the April break, and while it may sound a little far-fetched, history has shown that anything can happen in F1, especially when it comes to juggling team identities and power unit suppliers.\n\nThe 2026 season will see a reshuffle of engine partners with Sauber leaving Ferrari to become the works Audi outfit, and Red Bull and AlphaTauri parting company with Honda to run the new Ford-backed engine.\n\nHonda\u2019s position remains unclear. Encouraged by a double title success for Max Verstappen, the company is having second thoughts about its planned withdrawal from F1, and its name is on the list of manufacturers registered with the FIA for 2026.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that Honda will participate, but at least it has a foot in the door. If it does intend to take part it needs to already be working on a 2026 project, and doing so under the auspices of the cost cap and the other restrictions that now apply to engine manufacturers.\n\nHonda also needs to find a new partner team after its procrastination obliged Red Bull to take charge of its own destiny and create its own facility in Milton Keynes.\n\nRed Bull Racing RB18 with Honda logo Photo by: Giorgio Piola\n\n\u201cF1 is greatly shifting towards electrification, and carbon neutrality is our corporate wide target at Honda,\u201d Honda Racing Corporation president Koji Watanabe said in February.\n\n\u201cWe think that F1's future direction is in line with our target, so that is why we have decided to register as the manufacturer of a power unit.\n\n\u201cWe're curious about where F1 is going, F1 being the top racing category, and how is that going to look with more electrification happening? We would like to keep a very close eye on that. And that is why we have decided to register as a PU manufacturer.\n\n\u201cAfter we made the registration, we have been contacted by multiple F1 teams. For the time being, we would like to keep a close eye on where F1 is going and just see how things go. For now, we don't have any concrete decisions on whether or not we will be going back to joining F1.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all very vague, but clearly the interest is there if a suitable partner can be found.
