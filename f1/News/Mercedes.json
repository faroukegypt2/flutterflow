            "text": "Formula 1 is currently considering new teams to join the world championship grid, but many team principals aren\u2019t happy about this, including Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff. The deadline for formal applications with the FIA closed last May, and the sport\u2019s governing body is aiming to make its final decisions this month. The approved teams will then negotiate with Formula One Management, the championship\u2019s commercial rights holder, to secure their spots.\n\nThe concerns of the current teams revolve around the dilution of F1\u2019s prize pool by an additional team to share revenue with. The team bosses wanted to be included in the application process and have a say if a team was allowed to join. However, Wolff has added an additional concern to the mix, safety. According to Motorsport.com, he said:\n\n\u201cOur position was very clear - buy a team. There\u2019s a lot of consequences when you look at qualifying sessions. I mean already now we are looking like on a go-kart track, we are tripping over each other. There is a safety concern. We haven\u2019t got the logistics where to put an 11th team.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Austrian\u2019s concerns are completely overblown. Formula 1\u2019s regulations allow for a maximum of 13 teams. Garage facilities at circuits allowed to host F1 are built with those regulations in mind. The track might be too crowded during the first portion of qualifying, but the format could easily be changed to alleviate congestion.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWolff would then continue to try to compare the current situation in F1 to other team sports, stating:\n\n\u201cThere is no mature sports league in the world, whether it\u2019s a national football championship, or the Champions League, the NBA, the NFL, the NHL, where such a situation is possible, where you can say \u2018I\u2019m just setting up the team and I\u2019m joining, thank you very much for making me part of the prize fund.

Adding a team should benefit both sides without question.\n\nRelated Story Hitech Wants to Bring New Team to F1 Grid in 2026\n\n\"There is no mature sports league in the world, whether it's a national (soccer) championship, or the Champions League, the NBA, the NFL, the NHL, where such situation is possible, where you say I\u2019m setting up a team and I'm joining, thank you very much for making me part of the prize fund,\" Wolff said. \"You have to give to qualify; you have to go through the ranks; you have to showcase the commitment to the Championship that we've done over the many years.\"\n\nSo far, two groups\u2014one led by American Michael Andretti and the other by current F2 outfit Hitech\u2014have publicly expressed an intention to apply, or have applied, for membership in joining Formula 1. As many as two other groups are rumored to have also inquired about the possibility.\n\nWolff has yet to be overly impressed by any of the groups to the point that he's in support of welcoming them on board. A decision about the fate of the F1 hopefuls is expected to come down from the FIA sometime this month.\n\n\"So far, what we\u2019ve seen hasn\u2019t convinced the teams\u2014but we haven't seen the applications and submissions that were made to the FIA and to (F1 chief executive) Stefano (Domenicali), and they will judge whether that is positive for Formula 1 or not,\" Wolff said. \"But in any case, from a teams\u2019 owner side, is there no leagues which just increased the entries, because that just dilutes the whole league. I think if it's accretive then obviously not.\"",

I'm hoping to be here a lot longer. I feel like I've got another five years in me at least, no? Let's see.\"\n\nMercedes chief Toto Wolff is also confident Hamilton will not change his mind. Speaking at last weekend's Austrian Grand Prix, Wolff said: \"I'm still very confident.\n\n\"They want to do it super, to every detail and sometimes you can have a situation where everything is carved out. This is not a money discussion at all. It is about the future, what is it that we want to do right and optimise? We're not talking anything anymore about duration, money, all of that - it's other topics.\"\n\nHamilton was also asked for his thoughts on the threat of Just Stop Oil disrupting Sunday's race. He said: \"I support peaceful protests... From my perspective, and my team\u2019s perspective, we are focused on sustainability and we believe in what people [the protesters] are fighting for and we are making those changes as a sport.\n\n\"But safety is key. We don\u2019t want to put them in harm\u2019s way and we don\u2019t want to put anyone else in harm\u2019s way. If there was to be one [a protest] we hope it is not on track.\"",

This allows the total output from the V-8 and electric motor to be delivered simultaneously. The car starts in EV-only mode, and we estimate the electric-only range should be around 20 miles at speeds up to 87 mph. <br></p><h2 class=\"body-h2 css-1128h8c et3p2gv0\">An F1-derived hybrid system<br></h2><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">It takes quite a bit of complex choreography to ensure the S63 moves gracefully. At the risk of oversimplification, the system, referred to as a \"P3 hybrid,\" provides instantaneous torque from a standstill for faster launches and, if driven delicately, a smoother disposition around town. In the event of wheel slip at the rear axle, the AMG Performance 4Matic+ all-wheel-drive system performs a two-step and directs output to the front wheels via an electronically controlled clutch pack. Likewise, 4Matic+ provides all-wheel drive when the S63 is running on the electric motor alone. </p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">The 10.5-kWh battery, developed in conjunction with U.K.-based F1 engine manufacturer High Performance Powertrains (HPP), utilizes the lithium-ion energy storage system derived from the units used in the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team's Formula 1 hybrid race cars. Comparatively light and compact, it can withstand the stress and heat buildup of repeated rapid discharge and recharge cycles while maintaining high current flow thanks to an advanced cooling circuit. Designed to keep the battery at an optimal 113 degrees Fahrenheit, the cooling system circulates liquid around all 1200 cells before entering an integral heat exchanger attached directly to the battery and then to another exchanger at the front of the car. A safety system is in place to reduce output if temps wander too far from the sweet spot and to safeguard the battery from accelerated degradation.  </p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">Four levels of onboard regeneration are available, ranging from the almost freewheeling Level 0 to the almost one-pedal-driving Level 3, which can return over 90 kilowatts of energy to the battery, depending on driving conditions. We found Level 2 to be the ticket for comfortable cruising and Level 0 to be the right choice for the tight twisty roads of the Santa Monica Mountains. Interestingly, AMG says the only way to charge the battery to 100 percent is via the 3.7-kW onboard AC charger. Again, the battery is optimized for fast power delivery, not record-breaking economy runs, and the regeneration algorithms take this&#8212;and battery longevity&#8212;into consideration.</p><h2 class=\"body-h2 css-1128h8c et3p2gv0\">Driving the S63<br></h2><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">Though the hybrid system sounds a little complicated and intimidating, any concerns about its viability disappear after a short stint at the wheel. The various elements mesh imperceptibly thanks to careful calibration of the software, along with the electric motor's unique nature and its ability to provide immediate torque directly to the rear axle. Whether we were cruising the Pacific Coast Highway or hustling through the mountain roads above, the powertrain remains resolute with zero soft spots or clumsy handoffs. Such as a performance EV, plentiful shove is on tap at nearly any speed, but in the S63 it's accompanied by a genuine high-performance V-8 exhaust, tuned just short of full blat in Sport and Sport+ modes.</p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">You engage Launch mode by selecting the Sport+ drive mode, applying the brake firmly, and matting the accelerator; sidestep the brake, and the S63 steps off with an uninterrupted burst of acceleration that defies the vehicle's heft. Mercedes-AMG claims a 60-mph sprint in just 3.2 seconds. Note that the 2018 S63 sedan carried a 3.4-second 60-mph estimate; we managed to shave three-tenths off that estimate in our testing that model, giving us reason to think a sub-3.0-second real-world time is within the realm of possibility for the 2024 model. </p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">Stay in the throttle, and the electric motor's two-speed transmission at the rear axle shifts imperceptibly into second gear at 87 mph, with the electric motor spinning at about 13,500 rpm before the shift. The two ratios play a significant role in optimizing maximum torque for low- and high-speed situations. Although the motor's full blast of torque is available from idle, it does taper off at higher rpm, according to AMG. Top speed is an electronically limited 155 mph. </p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">The positioning of the electric drive unit above the rear axle should pay dividends in the form of front-to-rear weight distribution. Teamed with the standard adaptive air springs, up to 2.5 degrees of rear-wheel steering, and active anti-roll bars front and rear, the technology seemingly shrinks the footprint of the big sedan, encouraging you to cut a rug when the mood strikes. The electric motor's instantaneous torque helps the S63 pivot out of corners with tangible results. <br></p><h2 class=\"body-h2 css-1128h8c et3p2gv0\">S63 E Performance design</h2><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">Stylistically, the S63 hews to the conservative side. Notable is the lack of the Mercedes star hood ornament, replaced by a flat silver-and-black AMG hood emblem. There's also an AMG-specific grille and some tweaks to the fascia. At the back, one finds trapezoidal tailpipes and a rear diffuser. The 21-inch wheels are specific to the S63. But overall it cuts the profile of a clean, respectable sedan rather than a flashy extrovert. </p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">The interior includes the usual S-class opulence funneled through the AMG lens. That means infinitely comfortable seating at all four positions, bespoke upholstery and stitching in exclusive colors, and the requisite embossed AMG emblems to remind passengers you spent the big bucks.  </p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">We found the relatively conservative infotainment screen a stylish and refreshing break from the recent spate of oversized screens and information overload. Elegantly integrated into the center waterfall above the console, it's legible and easy to reach. Combined with the excellent head-up display, there's more than enough available data for the driver to consume safely.

            "text": "It's entirely possible to train an elephant to dance; the real trick is getting it to want to. Not that we're comparing the 2024 Mercedes-AMG S63 E Performance to the world's largest and strongest land-roving mammal, but since the car weighs in at an estimated 5500 pounds, measures 17.5 feet long, and packs nearly 800 horsepower, a certain similarity is undeniable. Our sample car's Selenite Grey Magno satin paint only encourages the analogy.\n\nFortunately, AMG has been challenging the laws of physics for decades, beginning with the original Mercedes-Benz 300 SEL 6.8 \"Red Pig\" in the 1970s.

Asked about a timeframe last month, he added: \"Soon, I think we're talking more days than weeks. He's the most important personality in the sport.\n\n\u201cHe's so multifaceted, not only the racing but also off-track. We need to keep in the sport for as long as possible.\n\n\"It is going to happen soon, and we are talking more days than weeks. From a team's perspective, Lewis and Mercedes have gone back a long time. He has never raced for any other brand than Mercedes. We both joined the team in 2013 together, and from a professional relationship, we now have a friendship. It has been a wonderful time.\"",

Lewis Hamilton also benefitted from that strategy and was able to stay ahead of McLaren\u2019s Oscar Piastri after passing Piastri when the McLaren driver made a pit stop before the safety car.\n\nVerstappen then won by more than three seconds in the 15-lap sprint to the finish after the safety car while Norris finished a convincing second over Hamilton. Piastri got the best finish of his career in fourth while Hamilton\u2019s Mercedes teammate George Russell finished fifth.\n\nThe win is Verstappen's eighth in the first 10 races of the season and continues Red Bull's streak of winning every race so far this season. Red Bull has won 11 races in a row dating back to last season and Sunday's win is their first British Grand Prix win since 2012.\n\nMcLaren\u2019s qualifying pace was no fluke\n\nWhile it was surprising to see both of McLaren\u2019s drivers finish in the top five for the first time since the Singapore Grand Prix a season ago, there was nothing flukey about the pace the team showed in qualifying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNorris qualified second while Piastri was third ahead of both Ferrari and Mercedes drivers. While Verstappen drove away from Norris after he passed him for the lead, both McLaren drivers looked to be the best of the rest before the pit stop sequence.\n\nNorris also held off Hamilton over the race\u2019s final stages on a set of hard tires. McLaren pitted for the hard compound tires after starting on the mediums while Hamilton and Verstappen chose to take the soft tires. Those tires conceivably should have put Hamilton in a position to easily get past Norris, but the hard tiers were a good fit for the McLaren and Hamilton couldn\u2019t put on an extended challenge for second place.\n\nPiastri also pitted for a set of hard tires in his pit stop and he kept George Russell at bay over the final laps despite Russell being on a set of medium tires. Russell started the race on the soft tires and had surprising pace and durability.\n\nThe fight behind Red Bull is fun\n\nWe\u2019ll get straight to the point: The 2023 season is Verstappen\u2019s crowning moment and a year of Red Bull domination. But if you can look past first place every week, there\u2019s some fascinating happenings behind them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcLaren\u2019s performance on Sunday adds to an already crowded fight for the second-fastest team among Mercedes, Aston Martin and Ferrari. Mercedes is second in the constructor\u2019s standings thanks to its reliability and race pace on Sundays while Aston Martin seems to have cooled off a bit since Fernando Alonso\u2019s hot start.\n\nFerrari is up and down and found itself on the wrong end of the strategy calls once again on Sunday. Both Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz pitted early and needed the race to run green to use the undercuts to their advantage. The safety car threw a wrench in those plans, however it was no guarantee that both Sainz and Leclerc could have stayed ahead of the Mercedes cars anyway.\n\nMcLaren is still way back in the constructor\u2019s standings of the other three teams because of its slow start. Competing for second-best is a long way off. But if the pace the team showed on Sunday is real, then the battle for the other podium spots is going to be a whole heck of a lot of fun.\n\nRace results\n\n1. Max Verstappen\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2.

Schumacher and Ferrari swinging back at Alonso and Renault in 2006 is the closest thing to an exception.\n\nMercedes getting back on terms with Red Bull and the Hamilton/Verstappen title fight resuming after a pause in which Mercedes was down for the count, and with the very different context of Verstappen now being the defending champion (and the potentially explosive subplot of Russell making it a three-way fight too), is a wonderful prospect.\n\nThe 2021 season often leaned too far to the wrong side of the tightrope between enthralling and terrifying that great motorsport rivalries balance on. It was also best enjoyed far away from social media and the extreme ends of the protagonists\u2019 fanbases.\n\nBut it was also absolutely glorious. Two teams of such quality, two drivers among the very greatest their sport has ever seen, with so little to choose between them all season and the advantage and championship battle momentum swinging so often. It\u2019s what every top-level sport wishes for. It was a privilege to follow it.\n\nA rematch is such a tantalising prospect. Mercedes will surely fight for a championship again before F1\u2019s next massive rules reset, its weight of recent achievement is too vast for it not to. It doing so with Hamilton again takes that narrative up another level.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why after so many years when it felt like Hamilton switching teams was what was needed to reinvigorate F1\u2019s drama level, him staying put now has the biggest potential to do that.",

It&#8217;s working. It is great.&#8221;</p><p>Asked if being beaten by different customer teams, Aston Martin at first and now McLaren, was a blow to Mercedes, Hamilton replied: &#8220;It&#8217;s not a blow. It&#8217;s just a wake-up call for us all that others are overtaking us and we need to do more.&#8221;</p><p>Mercedes are second in the championship, but 199 points behind Red Bull, and are struggling to beat teams using the German manufacturer&#8217;s engines. Merc-powered Aston Martin were the revelation of the early rounds, with Fernando Alonso standing on the podium six times in nine races, and they remain only three points behind.</p><h2>Mercedes enduring their worst spell in F1 since they returned in 2010</h2><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1354536 lazyload\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"hamilton qualy f1\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1354536 lazyload\" src=\"https://www.grandprix247.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hamilton-qualy-f1.jpg\" alt=\"hamilton qualy f1\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"></p><p>McLaren, with their heavily upgraded Mercedes-powered car, could provide similar shocks. Similarly Merc-powered Williams also appear to be waking up from their long slumber with Alex Albon quick in practice and qualifying a competitive eighth.</p><p>&#8220;It seems like they have made a massive step in understanding and performance,&#8221; Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said of McLaren&#8217;s new-found form after Norris finished fourth in Austria last weekend, with Russell seventh and Hamilton eighth. But the jury remained out amid suggestions that result was track specific given McLaren&#8217;s strong past form there.</p><p>Silverstone may have forced a rethink of that theory, and garnered praise from Woilff &#8220;I think it&#8217;s very encouraging to see that Aston Martin found massive chunks of lap times from last year to this year and in the same way you see that within the season McLaren doing that. You need to take your hat off if we see that consolidating, and certainly for us a good example of how you can turn around things.&#8221;</p><p>Asked about Hamilton&#8217;s &#8220;wake-up call&#8221; comments, Wolff replied: &#8220;From what you see, from the outside which is obviously only half the information, is that the car looks like a Red Bull. To be honest it doesn&#8217;t matter because only the stopwatch counts. This is what I guess Lewis was referring to. That this kind of design seems to be a good direction.</p><p>&#8220;But this is easier said than done. Each of us had bodyworks that looked like a Red Bull in the tunnel and it didn&#8217;t come up in performance.

            "text": "McLaren\u2019s pace during qualifying, for the 2023 British Grand Prix, is another wake-up call for Mercedes as they struggle for performance warns local hero Lewis Hamilton.\n\nThe seven-time Formula 1 World Champions sounded the warning to his team after another below-par session for a driver that has started P1 on 103 occasions, but not this Sunday.\n\nLando Norris qualified a stunning second and rookie teammate Oscar Piastri third, in a revised car and on a drying Silverstone track, with Mercedes\u2019s George Russell and Hamilton only good for sixth and seventh.\n\nA former McLaren driver himself, Hamilton said after qualy: \u201cIf you just put it (the McLaren) alongside a Red Bull, it looks very, very similar down the sides. It\u2019s working. It is great.\u201d\n\nAsked if being beaten by different customer teams, Aston Martin at first and now McLaren, was a blow to Mercedes, Hamilton replied: \u201cIt\u2019s not a blow. It\u2019s just a wake-up call for us all that others are overtaking us and we need to do more.\u201d\n\nMercedes are second in the championship, but 199 points behind Red Bull, and are struggling to beat teams using the German manufacturer\u2019s engines. Merc-powered Aston Martin were the revelation of the early rounds, with Fernando Alonso standing on the podium six times in nine races, and they remain only three points behind.\n\nMercedes enduring their worst spell in F1 since they returned in 2010\n\nMcLaren, with their heavily upgraded Mercedes-powered car, could provide similar shocks. Similarly Merc-powered Williams also appear to be waking up from their long slumber with Alex Albon quick in practice and qualifying a competitive eighth.\n\n\u201cIt seems like they have made a massive step in understanding and performance,\u201d Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said of McLaren\u2019s new-found form after Norris finished fourth in Austria last weekend, with Russell seventh and Hamilton eighth. But the jury remained out amid suggestions that result was track specific given McLaren\u2019s strong past form there.\n\nSilverstone may have forced a rethink of that theory, and garnered praise from Woilff \u201cI think it\u2019s very encouraging to see that Aston Martin found massive chunks of lap times from last year to this year and in the same way you see that within the season McLaren doing that. You need to take your hat off if we see that consolidating, and certainly for us a good example of how you can turn around things.\u201d\n\nAsked about Hamilton\u2019s \u201cwake-up call\u201d comments, Wolff replied: \u201cFrom what you see, from the outside which is obviously only half the information, is that the car looks like a Red Bull. To be honest it doesn\u2019t matter because only the stopwatch counts. This is what I guess Lewis was referring to. That this kind of design seems to be a good direction.\n\n\u201cBut this is easier said than done. Each of us had bodyworks that looked like a Red Bull in the tunnel and it didn\u2019t come up in performance. So we\u2019ve got to maybe look at it again because another team just found a second in performance,\u201d lamented Wolff. (Reporting by Alan Baldwin)",

And as FIA approaches probably bringing back more teams, Toto Wolff has seemed to raise concerns.&#160;</p>\n<p>Recently, Toto Wolff gave his opinions on FIA&#8217;s plans of adding new teams to the sport. And turns out he may not have been a big fan of it. He then stated that although they haven&#8217;t seen the documents that have been submitted to FIA and Stefano Domenicalli. Toto Wolff spoke from a team owner&#8217;s point of view saying he would not want to add more teams to the sport just like. <a href=\"https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/wolff-11th-f1-team-would-create-safety-issues/10492786/\">He claimed that would &#8220;dilute the league&#8221;</a>.&#160;</p>\n<h2>Toto Wolff voices opinion on 11 teams in F1</h2>\n<p>Toto Wolff expressed his opinions on FIA adding new teams to the sport and said that some tracks just won&#8217;t work in favor of 11 teams. He said, &#8220;Our position was very clear &#8211; buy a team. There are a lot of consequences when you look at qualifying sessions.

Toto Wolff compared the change to NHL and mentioned how the sport added new teams. He said,</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have done that in the past when F1 was on the brink of losing teams because of bankruptcy, we increased the number of teams and nobody complained about it. On the contrary, we felt that we needed to make sure that we have 10 teams on the grid and not lose any.

            "text": "Formula 1 has been known to have 10 teams on the tracks for a while now. But as the changes approach in 2026 is it possible that there will be more teams? FIA has made the changes they are planning to bring clarity to the engines and teams. They aren\u2019t only planning on changing the engines to make Formula 1 a more sustainable sport but also introducing more teams by 2026. And Toto Wolff might be against new teams.\n\nFormula 1 has become a sport that a lot of people air into. As more and more viewers add to the sport, FIA has decided to make it more interesting. It had been decided to not introduce more teams to the sport but that has now changed. FIA has been planning on introducing Audi and Honda to the sport by 2026. But as new teams are added to the sport, it will become tougher for the already existing teams to rank on top.\n\nThe number of teams in a sport can affect the game and the outcome in results. As FIA changes its mind to add more teams to the sport. This had only been the case way back in the 1980s and 1990s when Formula 1 had 14 teams on the track. And as FIA approaches probably bringing back more teams, Toto Wolff has seemed to raise concerns.\n\nRecently, Toto Wolff gave his opinions on FIA\u2019s plans of adding new teams to the sport. And turns out he may not have been a big fan of it. He then stated that although they haven\u2019t seen the documents that have been submitted to FIA and Stefano Domenicalli. Toto Wolff spoke from a team owner\u2019s point of view saying he would not want to add more teams to the sport just like. He claimed that would \u201cdilute the league\u201d.\n\nToto Wolff voices opinion on 11 teams in F1\n\nToto Wolff expressed his opinions on FIA adding new teams to the sport and said that some tracks just won\u2019t work in favor of 11 teams. He said, \u201cOur position was very clear \u2013 buy a team. There are a lot of consequences when you look at qualifying sessions. I mean already now we are looking like on a go-kart track, we are tripping over each other. There is a safety concern.\u201d\n\nToto Wolff says that F1 cannot accommodate an 11th team at certain tracks due to safety issues \ud83e\udd14\ud83c\udfce Do you think F1 has the capacity for a new team? pic.twitter.com/m8hcry8xsE \u2014 Motorsport.com (@Motorsport) July 7, 2023\n\n\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t got the logistics where to put an 11th team. Here in Silverstone, we can accommodate the Hollywood people, but on other circuits, we can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHe then went on to compare Formula 1 adding one more team to other sports. Toto Wolff compared the change to NHL and mentioned how the sport added new teams. He said,\n\n\u201cWe have done that in the past when F1 was on the brink of losing teams because of bankruptcy, we increased the number of teams and nobody complained about it. On the contrary, we felt that we needed to make sure that we have 10 teams on the grid and not lose any. So these two factors are very different with the NHL to the current situation.\u201d\n\nHe then later claimed that if there is going to be another team added, he would want them to add value to the sport. Toto said that if there is an addition to the teams then they should make the sport more exciting. And that it should also add more competition to the sports rather than just crowding the tracks.",

That changed days after the Spanish Grand Prix, when the German filled in for Lewis Hamilton at a Pirelli tyre test at the Barcelona track.\n\nSchumacher played an important role in helping the tyremaker to gather important data for the future. It also gave him vital experience behind the wheel of the W14 which will come in handy if needed to fill in on a race weekend this season.\n\nHis performance in the test caught the eye of team boss Wolff, who only had kind things to say about the 24-year-old. \"Following the Grand Prix in Spain, Mick got his first opportunity to drive the W14,\" said the Austrian.\n\n\"He settled in well during the Pirelli tyre test and enjoyed the experience. Mick has become a valuable member of the team already and his work in the simulator has proved useful in finding lap time, as we saw in Barcelona.\"\n\nSchumacher's work in the simulator has also contributed to the team's car upgrades. As a result of the changes, Mercedes secured their best result of the season in Spain with a double podium, beaten only by race-winner Max Verstappen.\n\nImage: Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula 1 Team) Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula 1 Team)\n\n\"The result in Spain was a well-deserved reward for everyone's efforts at Brackley and Brixworth to bring our update package to the track,\" said Wolff. \"We were pleased with how it performed, and it will provide a new baseline for us to build from.\n\n\"But we must also manage our expectations. It was a circuit that suited our car, and we should expect our direct competitors to be stronger in the next races. The gap to Red Bull is large and it will take lots of hard work to close that down. Nevertheless, we're up for the challenge.\n\n\"We now move on to Montreal. With its long straights and low-speed corners, it's not a track that we expect to suit our car as well as Barcelona did. No matter where the true pace of the car is this weekend, we will aim to maximise our result. The characteristics of the circuit will also provide further opportunity to learn about the W14 and feed into our development path.\"",

New components may have a significant impact on driving in the rain, when spray is a major hazard. The World Motor Sport Council came up with the concept for the piece last November while they were discussing how to deal with harsh weather. The test will be conducted by Mercedes and McLaren on July 13 at Silverstone's National circuit, which will be artificially flooded before the vehicles go to the track. The officials will record the tests to see how an F1 vehicle generates spray and whether the wheel arches have the desired impact. It is hoped that these new components will have the necessary effect after the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix, during which no racing laps were completed owing to horrible rainy conditions.</p> <p><strong>Also Read:&#160;</strong><a href=\"https://www.autox.com/motorsport-news/f1-max-verstappen-attacks-2026-formula-1-engine-rules-predicts-a-massive-developmentwar-113789/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"F1: Max Verstappen Attacks 2026 Formula 1 Engine Rules, Predicts a Massive 'Development&#160;War'\">F1: Max Verstappen Attacks 2026 Formula 1 Engine Rules, Predicts a Massive 'Development&#160;War'</a></p> <h2>F1: McLaren&#8217;s Austrian Grand Prix Performance Worries Rivals</h2> <p><img alt=\"F1 Mercedes McLaren \" height=\"720\" class=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\"></p> <p>McLaren driver Lando Norris hopes to duplicate his performance from the previous weekend in front of his home Formula One supporters at Silverstone.

At the Red Bull Ring, the 23-year-old finished in fourth place, ahead Mercedes' George Russell and &#160;Lewis Hamilton, who finished seventh and eighth, respectively, due to penalties. Hamilton has 106 points and Russell has 72, but Norris only has 24 in the championship rankings. In the constructors' standings, Mercedes is in second place and McLaren is in sixth.</p> <p>Norris drove with gusto to finish fifth, which became fourth following an extra track limits penalty for Ferrari's Carlos Sainz.

There will be a unique Chrome livery on both Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri's vehicles for the remainder of the British Grand Prix weekend. The design is a nod to the team's very successful chrome livery, which ran from 2006 to 2014 and was largely responsible for the team's meteoric rise to prominence, culminating in Lewis Hamilton's drivers' world championship in 2008.&#160;</p> <p>McLaren's Formula One and IndyCar cars have had a wide range of special looks throughout several seasons. Two years ago, it revived Gulf's historic livery for the Monaco Grand Prix and this year, it used a distinct 'Triple Crown' colour scheme for that race. On the same day, it ran three legacy liveries for the Indianapolis 500. Norris admired the 1984 McLaren MP4/2 piloted by Alain Prost and Niki Lauda and said he'd want to race a vehicle with a similar livery someday.</p> </div>",

The World Motor Sport Council came up with the concept for the piece last November while they were discussing how to deal with harsh weather. The test will be conducted by Mercedes and McLaren on July 13 at Silverstone's National circuit, which will be artificially flooded before the vehicles go to the track. The officials will record the tests to see how an F1 vehicle generates spray and whether the wheel arches have the desired impact. It is hoped that these new components will have the necessary effect after the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix, during which no racing laps were completed owing to horrible rainy conditions.\n\nAlso Read: F1: Max Verstappen Attacks 2026 Formula 1 Engine Rules, Predicts a Massive 'Development War'\n\nF1: McLaren\u2019s Austrian Grand Prix Performance Worries Rivals\n\nMcLaren driver Lando Norris hopes to duplicate his performance from the previous weekend in front of his home Formula One supporters at Silverstone. Norris was the best of the British drivers in Austria. At the Red Bull Ring, the 23-year-old finished in fourth place, ahead Mercedes' George Russell and Lewis Hamilton, who finished seventh and eighth, respectively, due to penalties. Hamilton has 106 points and Russell has 72, but Norris only has 24 in the championship rankings. In the constructors' standings, Mercedes is in second place and McLaren is in sixth.\n\nNorris drove with gusto to finish fifth, which became fourth following an extra track limits penalty for Ferrari's Carlos Sainz. McLaren benefited from Mercedes and Aston Martin having an off-weekend.\n\nAlso Read: F1: Alpine's Esteban Ocon Breaks Formula 1 Record Held by Maldonado at the Austrian Grand Prix\n\nF1: McLaren to Run Special Chrome Livery at Silverstone\n\nMcLaren is bringing back one of its most famous Formula One liveries, the chrome look. There will be a unique Chrome livery on both Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri's vehicles for the remainder of the British Grand Prix weekend. The design is a nod to the team's very successful chrome livery, which ran from 2006 to 2014 and was largely responsible for the team's meteoric rise to prominence, culminating in Lewis Hamilton's drivers' world championship in 2008.\n\nMcLaren's Formula One and IndyCar cars have had a wide range of special looks throughout several seasons. Two years ago, it revived Gulf's historic livery for the Monaco Grand Prix and this year, it used a distinct 'Triple Crown' colour scheme for that race. On the same day, it ran three legacy liveries for the Indianapolis 500. Norris admired the 1984 McLaren MP4/2 piloted by Alain Prost and Niki Lauda and said he'd want to race a vehicle with a similar livery someday.",

But not for long as Alonso went quickest again, setting a 1:30.730.\n\nVerstappen would then quickly go back to the top \u2013 only going 0.011 seconds quicker than the Aston Martin driver.\n\nWith six minutes to go, Russell reports that \u201cit is raining everywhere\u201d, which is not good new for Alex Albon. The Thai driver had his lap time deleted for exceeding track limits at Stowe.\n\nRed flag\n\nWith three minutes and 11 seconds to go, a red flag was brought out. Haas driver Kevin Magnussen stopped on track next to the pitlane. Could the drivers in the bottom five have enough time to improve their lap times?\n\nThe cars went out of their garages to go back out to the pitlane. However, Verstappen did not find it easy. The Dutchman broke his front wing, understeering into the wall. The reigning world champion had to get his front wing repaired.\n\nAll driver scrambled to get out of the pitlane to set a lap time. Although rain had been reported, the track was ramping up.\n\nThis was shown as Sergio Perez briefly went quickest, setting a 1:29.968. However, the Mexican was quickly beaten by five tenths by Albon, setting a 1:29.466. The Thai\u2019s teammate Sargeant managed a time of a 1:29.873.\n\nLando Norris would then go quickest. The McLaren driver broke into the 1:28\u2019s, setting a 1:28.917. The Briton was the only driver to end Q1 in the 1:28\u2019s.\n\nMeanwhile, despite Perez setting the quickest time briefly, the Mexican would be knocked out in Q1, qualifying in 16th. The Red Bull driver has now not made Q3 in the past five races. Is the Mexican under severe pressure to keep his seat at the Austrian team?\n\nThe 31-year-old was joined by Yuki Tsunoda, Zhou Guanyu, Nyck de Vries and Kevin Magnussen in the drop zone, who all went out in Q1.\n\nThe first stage of qualifying was not done there, as Valtteri Bottas reported no power in sector two during his in lap.\n\nQ2\n\nAfter a lengthy delay, Q2 finally commenced. Fernando Alonso lead out the drivers out of the pitlane. All drivers bolted on the soft compound tyre.\n\nA mixture of feelings were amongst the pit wall as Alonso\u2019s engineer told his driver \u201clight rain any minute now\u201d. However, Norris\u2019 engineer told his driver \u201cno rain expected\u201d.\n\nAlonso was the first driver to set a lap time in Q2. The Spaniard set a time of a 1:30.660. However, the Aston Martin driver was quickly beaten by Norris, setting a 1:29.427.\n\nInterestingly, Verstappen could not beat Norris\u2019 time, going 0.078 seconds slower than the McLaren driver.\n\nSeven minutes in, Alonso would reclaim the top spot off of Norris. The Spaniard set a 1:29.052, closely followed by Albon, who was a tenth behind the Aston Martin driver.\n\nWith five minutes to go Verstappen briefly went to the top, setting a 1:28.570. However, McLaren driver Oscar Piastri beat the Dutchman\u2019s time by 0.003 seconds.\n\nHamilton would then give the fans something to cheer going to the top by 0.022 seconds. However, fellow Briton Norris smashed the Mercedes drivers time by five tenths, setting a 1:28.042.\n\nOn the last runs, Verstappen set all three purple sectors, going quickest. The Dutchman broke into the 1:27\u2019s, setting a 1:27.702.\n\nThe five drivers who were eliminated from Q2 were: Nico Hulkenberg, Lance Stroll, Esteban Ocon, Logan Sargeant and Valtteri Bottas \u2013 who could not participate in Q2 due to engine issues.\n\nQ3\n\nThe lights went green for the final 12 minutes of qualifying. Both Mercedes drivers lead the way out of the pitlane. DRS was also enabled for the final stage of qualifying. Could this suit Red Bull?\n\nHamilton set the pace, setting a 1:27.717 on used soft tyres. However, Verstappen went six tenths quicker than the Mercedes driver, setting a 1:27.084 on a brand new set of soft tyres to take provisional pole.\n\nLeclerc\u2019s final run was not enough to beat Verstappen\u2019s time, despite setting the fastest first sector.\n\nHowever, Norris would go up to provisional pole, setting a 1:26.961. But Verstappen would take pole, setting a 1:26.720.\n\nTop 10\n\nMax Verstappen Lando Norris Oscar Piastri Charles Leclerc Carlos Sainz George Russell Lewis Hamilton Alex Albon Fernando Alonso Pierre Gasly\n\nFull results of the 2023 British Grand Prix qualifying session can be found here\n\nFeature Image Credit: Mark Thompson via Getty Images",

Don\u2019t rule it out, though he will have competition behind him from the Ferraris and the Mercedes cars, who struggled in qualifying but should \u2013 as ever \u2013 be more competitive in the race than in qualifying.\n\nWhen is it?\n\nThe 2023 British Grand Prix takes place from Friday July 7 until Sunday July 8 at Silverstone.\n\nWhat time do the sessions start?\n\nAll times British Summer Time\n\nFriday, July 7\n\nPractice 1: 12.30pm\n\nPractice 2: 4pm\n\nSaturday, July 8\n\nPractice 3: 11.30am\n\nQualifying: 3pm\n\nSunday, July 9\n\nRace: 3pm\n\nWhat TV channel is it on?\n\nSky Sports F1 have near-exclusive live coverage rights in the UK this year and indeed for the next few with their usual excellent team.\n\nSky\u2019s qualifying coverage on Saturday begins at 2.15pm BST with their race program starting at 1.30pm on Sunday.\n\nThis is the only race of the season that is on free-to-air television in the United Kingdom, with Channel 4 hosting live coverage.\n\nTheir qualifying program starts at 2pm with their race coverage at 1.30pm on Sunday. They also have live coverage of all three practice sessions.\n\nWhat is the weather forecast?\n\nFriday was a hot and fine day for practice, but Saturday\u2019s running has already seen some rain, with fairly heavy showers disrupting third and final practice. Qualifying began slightly damp but finished in dry conditions.\n\nSunday could also be disrupted by rain. There was a fairly lengthy but steady shower during the F3 feature race on Sunday morning and there is a reasonable chance of rain throughout the early afternoon, with the Met Office forecasting around a 30 per cent chance of light showers between noon and 2pm and similar between 3 and 4pm.\n\nWhat were the times after qualifying?\n\nMax Verstappen (Ned) Red Bull 1:26.720 Lando Norris (Gbr) McLaren 1:26.961 Oscar Piastri (Aus) McLaren 1:27.092 Charles Leclerc (Mon) Ferrari 1:27.136 Carlos Sainz Jr. (Spa) Ferrari 1:27.148 George Russell (Gbr) Mercedes GP 1:27.155 Lewis Hamilton (Gbr) Mercedes GP 1:27.211 Alexander Albon (Tha) Williams 1:27.530 Fernando Alonso (Spa) Aston Martin 1:27.659 Pierre Gasly (Fra) Alpine 1:27.689 Nico Hulkenberg (Ger) Haas F1 Team 1:28.896 Lance Stroll (Can) Aston Martin 1:28.935 Esteban Ocon (Fra) Alpine 1:28.956 Logan Sargeant (USA) Williams 1:29.031 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Alfa Romeo Racing 1:29.798 Sergio Perez (Mex) Red Bull 1:29.968 Yuki Tsunoda (Jpn) Scuderia AlphaTauri 1:30.025 Guanyu Zhou (Chn) Alfa Romeo Racing 1:30.123 Nyck de Vries (Ned) Scuderia AlphaTauri 1:30.513 Kevin Magnussen (Den) Haas F1 Team 1:32.378\n\nWhat do we know about Silverstone?\n\nCircuit length: 5.891km\n\n5.891km First grand prix: 1950\n\n1950 Laps: 52\n\n52 Race distance: 306.198km\n\n306.198km Race lap record: 1:27.097 (Max Verstappen, 2020)\n\n1:27.097 (Max Verstappen, 2020) 2022 winner: Carlos Sainz, Ferrari\n\nCarlos Sainz, Ferrari Number of corners: 18\n\n18 Overtaking chances: One of the best of the year, by and large, with usually entertaining racing at Silverstone. The loop of turns three and four is possible, but it normally presents a set-up for the straight down to turn six at Brooklands, aided by DRS. Again, DRS plays another part in the next best spot, which is the run down the Hangar Straight to the quick right-hander at Stowe. Not impossible in the final chicane and then the very final corner of the track too. We\u2019ve also seen the odd move at Copse.\n\nWhat are the current standings?\n\nDrivers: top 10",

            "title": "Why \u2018no slower\u2019 Mercedes is giving up on its F1 car concept",
            "article_html": "<div><p>After a troubled pre-season testing run, the German car manufacturer brushed itself off, dug deep, got to the bottom of the problems it faced with the W13, and late in the season won the Brazilian Grand Prix.&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>Fast forward to now and an almost identical six tenths gap &#8211; from a 0.680 seconds deficit to pole position in 2022 to a 0.632 seconds gap this year &#8211; has triggered a completely different reaction.&#160;</p>\n<p>Rather than it pointing to a good baseline for <a href=\"https://www.motorsport.com/team/mercedes/5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mercedes</a> to move forward from in the annual F1 development war, it has instead thrown up the white flag.&#160;</p>\n<p>Within minutes of the end of qualifying, and even before <a href=\"https://www.motorsport.com/driver/george-russell/21167/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">George Russell</a> and <a href=\"https://www.motorsport.com/driver/lewis-hamilton/1278/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lewis Hamilton</a> had sat down with the engineers, team boss Toto Wolff declared that title hopes were all but over and that a new car concept was needed.&#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don't think this package is going to be competitive eventually,&#8221; he said.&#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We gave it our best shot all over the winter, and now we just need to all regroup and sit down with the engineers, who are totally not dogmatic about anything.&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>&#8220;There are no holy cows and we need to decide what is the development direction that we want to pursue in order to be competitive to win races.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n<p>F1 teams are normally eager to wait a few races before properly judging how their cars stack up against the opposition &#8211; especially as different circuits can juggle up the competitive order quite a lot as strengths and weaknesses are exposed.&#160;</p>\n<p>So Wolff declaring it virtually game over with the W14 after just a single qualifying session may seem quite strange. However, there are some solid reasons behind his stance.&#160;</p>\n<p>Chief among these is that Mercedes knows it is a completely different situation to last year when there was a mismatch between the potential of the W13 and what it was seeing on track.&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>It knew that somewhere deep within the quirks of its 2022 car was an awful lot of downforce that it just needed to be able to extract somehow without it triggering porpoising.&#160;</p>\n<p>This time around the team is a different place. The W14 is performing exactly as the team anticipated, and it is not a case of there being a lot of lap time that it knows can be unlocked further down the road.&#160;</p>\n<p>The team has admitted that a pretty big update is being worked on, potentially ready for around the time of the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in mid-May, but that may only bring a couple of tenths.&#160;</p>\n<p>That is not the game-changing performance Mercedes needs to be able to take on the might of Red Bull, <a href=\"https://www.motorsport.com/team/ferrari/3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ferrari</a> and now Aston Martin, who themselves are also likely to be bringing further upgrades to their cars over the next weeks.&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>As Wolff admitted on Saturday night, Mercedes has not delivered a car that is performing worse than anticipated. It is just not good enough compared to the other cars.&#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We hit our targets,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And that's why we gave it our best shot. &#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The moment comes when the stopwatch comes out, and that showed us that it's simply not good enough. We haven't got enough downforce. And we need to wait to find solutions to fix that.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n<h2>Aston Martin data point&#160;</h2>\n<img src=\"//cdn-8.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6AEowAo6/s8/fernando-alonso-aston-martin-a-1.jpg\" alt=\"Fernando Alonso, Aston Martin AMR23\">\n<p class=\"title\">Fernando Alonso, Aston Martin AMR23</p>\n<p class=\"photographer\">Photo by: Steven Tee / <a href=\"https://www.motorsportimages.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Motorsport Images</a></p>\n<p>Mercedes&#8217; struggles have been further exposed by the fact that customer team Aston Martin has leapfrogged it in the pecking order.&#160;</p>\n<p>But while the progress that Aston Martin has made in delivering arguably the third-fastest car is a blow, its rival&#8217;s pace will at least provide a wealth of answers for Brackley about where its gains need to come.&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>With Aston Martin having the same power unit, gearbox and rear suspension as Mercedes, there are some clear answers about where the W14 package is lacking.&#160;</p>\n<p>As Wolff said: &#8220;They gained two seconds in half a year, and their car is half ours from the engine, gearbox and the rear suspension. They use the same wind tunnel, so there are a lot of parallels. We just need to acknowledge that they've done an outstanding job.&#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If it was mechanical or suspension [weakness] then Aston Martin should have it too. &#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The point is we're losing it in the high speed. It's Turns 5/6/7. This is pretty much the only place where we're losing large chunks of time.

            "text": "After a troubled pre-season testing run, the German car manufacturer brushed itself off, dug deep, got to the bottom of the problems it faced with the W13, and late in the season won the Brazilian Grand Prix.\n\nFast forward to now and an almost identical six tenths gap \u2013 from a 0.680 seconds deficit to pole position in 2022 to a 0.632 seconds gap this year \u2013 has triggered a completely different reaction.\n\nRather than it pointing to a good baseline for Mercedes to move forward from in the annual F1 development war, it has instead thrown up the white flag.\n\nWithin minutes of the end of qualifying, and even before George Russell and Lewis Hamilton had sat down with the engineers, team boss Toto Wolff declared that title hopes were all but over and that a new car concept was needed.\n\n\u201cI don't think this package is going to be competitive eventually,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe gave it our best shot all over the winter, and now we just need to all regroup and sit down with the engineers, who are totally not dogmatic about anything.\n\n\u201cThere are no holy cows and we need to decide what is the development direction that we want to pursue in order to be competitive to win races.\u201d\n\nF1 teams are normally eager to wait a few races before properly judging how their cars stack up against the opposition \u2013 especially as different circuits can juggle up the competitive order quite a lot as strengths and weaknesses are exposed.\n\nSo Wolff declaring it virtually game over with the W14 after just a single qualifying session may seem quite strange. However, there are some solid reasons behind his stance.\n\nChief among these is that Mercedes knows it is a completely different situation to last year when there was a mismatch between the potential of the W13 and what it was seeing on track.\n\nIt knew that somewhere deep within the quirks of its 2022 car was an awful lot of downforce that it just needed to be able to extract somehow without it triggering porpoising.\n\nThis time around the team is a different place. The W14 is performing exactly as the team anticipated, and it is not a case of there being a lot of lap time that it knows can be unlocked further down the road.\n\nThe team has admitted that a pretty big update is being worked on, potentially ready for around the time of the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in mid-May, but that may only bring a couple of tenths.\n\nThat is not the game-changing performance Mercedes needs to be able to take on the might of Red Bull, Ferrari and now Aston Martin, who themselves are also likely to be bringing further upgrades to their cars over the next weeks.\n\nAs Wolff admitted on Saturday night, Mercedes has not delivered a car that is performing worse than anticipated. It is just not good enough compared to the other cars.\n\n\u201cWe hit our targets,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that's why we gave it our best shot.\n\n\u201cThe moment comes when the stopwatch comes out, and that showed us that it's simply not good enough. We haven't got enough downforce. And we need to wait to find solutions to fix that.\u201d\n\nAston Martin data point\n\nFernando Alonso, Aston Martin AMR23 Photo by: Steven Tee / Motorsport Images\n\nMercedes\u2019 struggles have been further exposed by the fact that customer team Aston Martin has leapfrogged it in the pecking order.\n\nBut while the progress that Aston Martin has made in delivering arguably the third-fastest car is a blow, its rival\u2019s pace will at least provide a wealth of answers for Brackley about where its gains need to come.\n\nWith Aston Martin having the same power unit, gearbox and rear suspension as Mercedes, there are some clear answers about where the W14 package is lacking.\n\nAs Wolff said: \u201cThey gained two seconds in half a year, and their car is half ours from the engine, gearbox and the rear suspension. They use the same wind tunnel, so there are a lot of parallels. We just need to acknowledge that they've done an outstanding job.\n\n\u201cIf it was mechanical or suspension [weakness] then Aston Martin should have it too.\n\n\u201cThe point is we're losing it in the high speed. It's Turns 5/6/7. This is pretty much the only place where we're losing large chunks of time. We are okay in the other corners, we are okay on the straight.\u201d\n\nThe big decision\n\nGeorge Russell, Mercedes F1 W14 Photo by: Glenn Dunbar / Motorsport Images\n\nWhatever the outcome of the Bahrain Grand Prix, Wolff is insistent that the team needs to switch paths with its car.\n\nHe talked in Bahrain of the need to go down \u2018untreaded\u2019 paths in the quest for the kind of performance step that it needs to get itself back to the front.\n\nThat route looks almost certain to mean ripping up the concept of the current Mercedes \u2013 which goes beyond just its zero-pod concept and extends to its floor and diffuser design.\n\nAnd, with most of the grid having changed tack to pursue the Red Bull downwash solution that looks dominant again, there seems little doubt that Mercedes too will have to swallow its pride and look at it.\n\nWhat will deliver the biggest dilemma for Mercedes is whether it completely abandons all efforts on the current car to start on its new concept, or if it tries to work on both concepts in parallel.\n\nSuch a decision is especially tricky in the cost cap era, as the team is unlikely to be able to afford the kind of response that could unleash a totally overhauled B-spec this season. It means it will have to stick with the W14 for a while.\n\nAny new car concept is most likely going to be something arriving for 2024, so the question is how soon does Mercedes switch off work on the current car?\n\nOne scenario, which sources say the team is open-minded to, could be in abandoning the work coming for the Imola upgrade and instead embark on the new concept work immediately.
