look to the inside of the first corner starting in third.\n\nThere, Verstappen went the long way around to cement second and he then chased Norris down the Wellington straight, where the leader successfully weaved to disrupt the two to the pack behind.\n\nNorris was able to initially keep Verstappen at bay but on lap five of 52 Verstappen used the powerful DRS effect on the Red Bull to shoot along the Wellington straight and then dive back into the lead at Brooklands.\n\nMcLaren informed Norris that Piastri would hold station in third at this stage, with the top three already well clear of Charles Leclerc and George Russell battling at the head of the pack behind.\n\nNorris stayed with Verstappen before finally falling out of DRS range at one-fifth distance, where the teams were split informing their drivers over whether the clouds that had built up over Silverstone ahead of the start would start to deposit rain on proceedings.\n\nThe drivers did report light drizzle through the next phase before attention turned to the planned single stops for the frontrunners, who had all started on the mediums bar Russell on the softs that held on better than expected over a race stint as he continued to chase Leclerc closely at this stage.\n\nVerstappen gradually pulled clear of Norris, their times getting quicker through the 1m33s bracket initially before reaching the mid-1m32s

upgraded to a full safety car period so the Haas could be craned onto a recovery truck, during which Verstappen and Norris pitted, as did many others in the pack, including Hamilton, who had been chasing the Ferrari cars and Russell early on after losing ground at the start from his seventh place starting spot.\n\nThe leaders were split on tyres for the second stint, with Verstappen and

the field.\n\nNevertheless, he did not benefit from a safety car stop and so had to do plenty of overtaking, including a late move into Stowe on Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso, who had battled

At just 26 years old, he already has one championship under his belt and looks on pace to win a second, unless the wheels completely fall off of his 2023 campaign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After winning last weekend at Mid-Ohio, Palou has won 4 of the last 5 races. That is a level of dominance not often seen in IndyCar, a series wit a far more level playing field than Formula 1.</p><p class=\"outki-75465b5b429fc6db5b6dc90569943516 outki-tw-middle-article\" id=\"outki-75465b5b429fc6db5b6dc90569943516\"></p><p class=\"outki-40c17cef141567b8fc17f25f22c7d71f outki-middle-content-mobile\" id=\"outki-40c17cef141567b8fc17f25f22c7d71f\"></p><p class=\"outki-4171122ffb5665849884bfa37f0d5022 outki-middle-content-desktop\" id=\"outki-4171122ffb5665849884bfa37f0d5022\"></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Palou is one of the series&#8217; rising stars, and they can&#8217;t afford to lose him. Not just because of what he brings to the series, but the message that would send.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Palou move to F1 &#8212; especially if it proved to be successful &#8212; would likely lead to more of the series&#8217; top talent being poached by F1 teams. Before this season, Red Bull was reportedly working to bring Andretti Autosport&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.outkick.com/colton-herta-could-be-in-f1-next-year-but-a-lot-needs-to-happen-first/\">Colton Herta</a> to AlphaTauri. A lack of super license points prevented that from happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>IndyCar wants to paint itself top-tier series like Formula 1. Not as a viable stepping stone to F1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The series will never grow if begins yielding top talent to Formula 1.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://www.outkick.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1489891870-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-618956\">Chip Ganassi Racing&#8217;s Alex Palou is on a heater this season and looks to be on track for his second IndyCar championship.

That&#8217;s the multi-million dollar question, isn&#8217;t it? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many drivers &#8212; especially those from Europe like Palou &#8212; grow up wanting to race in F1. If that opportunity to take one of F1&#8217;s 20 seats is on the table, he&#8217;s going to take it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s going to be extremely hard to figure out a way to convince drivers to give up what was potentially a lifelong dream and stay in IndyCar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the answer is money. Maybe the answer is pointing out that staying at Ganassi or Arrow McLaren would allow Palou to compete for wins, while a move to AlphaTauri wouldn&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>IndyCar needs to do something. Because if Palou leaves for F1, expect other top-level talent to follow him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Follow on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Matt_Reigle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@Matt_Reigle</a></p>\n<p class=\"outki-d26beca1bcd0ae079fd725d71a2c4fc9 outki-after-content-desktop\" id=\"outki-d26beca1bcd0ae079fd725d71a2c4fc9\"></p><p class=\"outki-361cd5c38db35443750246ec1c95cf75 outki-after-content-mobile_1\" id=\"outki-361cd5c38db35443750246ec1c95cf75\"></p><p class=\"outki-551347ffab05f1f5141910abb9ac0b57 outki-tw-after-content-article\" id=\"outki-551347ffab05f1f5141910abb9ac0b57\"></p>\t\t</div>",

That is a level of dominance not often seen in IndyCar, a series wit a far more level playing field than Formula 1.\n\nPalou is one of the series\u2019 rising stars, and they can\u2019t afford to lose him. Not just because of what he brings to the series, but the message that would send.\n\nA Palou move to F1 \u2014 especially if it proved to be successful \u2014 would likely lead to more of the series\u2019 top talent being poached by F1 teams. Before this season, Red Bull was reportedly working to bring Andretti Autosport\u2019s Colton Herta to AlphaTauri. A lack of super license points prevented that from happening.\n\nIndyCar wants to paint itself top-tier series like Formula 1. Not as a viable stepping stone to F1.\n\nThe series will never grow if begins yielding top talent to Formula 1.\n\nChip Ganassi Racing\u2019s Alex Palou is on a heater this season and looks to be on track for his second IndyCar championship. (Photo by Justin Casterline/Getty Images)\n\nSo What Should They Do?\n\nThe problem is how do they prevent that from happening? That\u2019s the multi-million dollar question, isn\u2019t it?\n\nMany drivers \u2014 especially those from Europe like Palou \u2014 grow up wanting to race in F1. If that opportunity to take one of F1\u2019s 20 seats is on the table, he\u2019s going to take it.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be extremely hard to figure out a way to convince drivers to give up what was potentially a lifelong dream and stay in IndyCar.\n\nPerhaps the answer is money. Maybe the answer is pointing out that staying at Ganassi or Arrow McLaren would allow Palou to compete for wins, while a move to AlphaTauri wouldn\u2019t.\n\nIndyCar needs to do something. Because if Palou leaves for F1, expect other top-level talent to follow him.\n\nFollow on Twitter: @Matt_Reigle",

            "text": "After the variable weather in Canada and the sprint format in Austria, Formula 1 got itself settled into a standard workmanlike weekend in Britain.\n\nUnsurprisingly Red Bull Racing ended Friday outright fastest after Max Verstappen topped both practice sessions.\n\nBut F1\u2019s run of difficult-to-read practice results was untamed by the return to standard running at the sport\u2019s oldest circuit.\n\nWatch the Formula 1 British Grand Prix 2023 live and ad-break free in racing on Kayo Sports on Monday, 10 July, at 12:00am AEST. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now >\n\n\n\nCarlos Sainz was impressive for Ferrari to keep Verstappen in his sights just 0.022 seconds up the road.\n\nAlex Albon was a wild inclusion into the top three, pipping Sergio P\u00e9rez in his Union Jack-festooned Williams to lap only 0.218 seconds slower than the leading Dutchman.\n\nLogan Sargeant proved it was no fluke, putting the sister car fifth.\n\nYet Mercedes, on a track that ought to suit the W14, struggled for pace at the back of a midfield that was covered by just 0.376 seconds.\n\nAre we really on for a dramatically close weekend of racing in Silverstone, or is there a reasonable explanation for the jumbled order?\n\nTYRES CHANGES, BRITISH SUMMER AT PLAY\n\nTyres might not be an especially exciting talking point, but a key part of Friday practice was the introduction of Pirelli\u2019s new tyre construction.\n\nThe new design is stronger to withstand the rapidly increasing downforce loads of the cars in the early days of these regulations.\n\nThis is one of the hardest tracks for tyres on the calendar. To underline the rate of development, this year\u2019s FP2 lap times are almost a second quicker than they were last year.\n\nPirelli also set unusually high tyre pressures for the new construction. Combined with a high-ish track temperature just above 40\u00b0C, drivers were really struggling for grip for a lot of the day.\n\nVerstappen described it like driving on ice despite his confident lap times.\n\nThe Mercedes drivers, already in a difficult-to-handle car, were visibly struggling to keep the W14 on track.\n\nThose factors also explain what we saw in the race simulation runs.\n\nAverage lap times, mediums\n\nRed Bull Racing: 1:33.017 (4 laps)\n\nFerrari: 1:33.976 (4 laps)\n\nAston Martin: 1:34.416 (9 laps)\n\nMercedes: 1:34.619 (3 laps)\n\nRed Bull Racing\u2019s short run on softs probably exaggerates the gap, but the RB19 is also the most downforce-ladened car. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see it get the most out of the tyres when grip is at a premium relative to its rivals.\n\nConsider the difference when they switched to softs.\n\nAverage lap times, softs\n\nRed Bull Racing: 1:33.646 (7 laps)\n\nMercedes: 1:33.725 (4 laps)\n\nAston Martin: 1:33.983 (6 laps)\n\nFerrari: 1:34.506 (9 laps)\n\nPirelli figures the soft tyre is 1.2 seconds quicker than the medium. When everyone got a boost in grip by default, the order appeared to close up slightly.\n\nIt\u2019ll be interesting to see what the teams find in their overnight analyses, which will of course change the order by Saturday.\n\nQualifying day is also expected to be cooler than Friday, with rain in the air too, which could take some of the sting out of the higher pressures.\n\nFERRARI\u2019S FEARS EXPOSED ON DIFFICULT DAY\n\nOne thing clear in the above soft-tyre data is that Ferrari appears to be struggling with race pace again.\n\nFerrari had been hopeful recent upgrades had dialled the tyre-chewing behaviour out of the car, and cooler Saturday conditions might yet bring it back into the fold, but the punishing track layout looks set to take the SF-23 to task.\n\n\u201cWe need to keep working on tyre management and race pace,\u201d Sainz said. \u201cThis should be our main point of focus going into tomorrow, as today we could see that over one lap we were not too bad.\u201d\n\nThat could be difficult for the team, though, with only half the data it would\u2019ve expected from FP2 thanks to an electrical problem in Charles Leclerc\u2019s car.\n\nMechanics frantically attempted to fix it, but it became clear quickly the work wouldn\u2019t get done before the end of the session, leaving him with no laps.\n\nThat meant Ferrari got little data on the medium tyre in particular, which is likely to be the main race tyre, putting it on the back foot before the weekend even really got going.\n\nMERCEDES LOCKED IN A BATTLE WITH ASTON MARTIN\n\n\u201cToday it looked like we had a race car that could fight for a podium with a qualifying car that would struggle to threaten the top 10,\u201d Mercedes trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin summarised at the end of a confusing Friday for the team.\n\nThe story for Mercedes ahead of Silverstone was whether its next round of upgrades would bring it back into the podium battle, but the combination of conditions and tyres painted a very messy picture for the team that has dominated this circuit for the last decade.\n\nLewis Hamilton complained of dreaded bouncing in FP1, when George Russell also notified that his steering rack was vibrating. Both suffered badly from the low-grip conditions and struggled to string together clean laps.\n\nThat, combined with a lot of experimentation in both sessions, was responsible for their poor single-lap pace.\n\nBut the team is confident that the new parts are working and that its race pace is strong despite never embarking on a particularly long run on the medium tyre.\n\nMercedes is also hopeful that the trend of the W14 performing stronger in cooler conditions will come to the fore for the rest of the weekend.\n\nAston Martin spent a lot of the day experimenting with the car too, having brought a new front wing to Silverstone from its headquarters across the road from the track entrance.\n\nIt was a consistent performer in both sessions and would appear to be well placed for the podium \u2014 or at least a podium battle with Mercedes if the long-race predictions prove accurate.\n\nWILLIAMS IN THE SWEET SPOT IN THE MIDFIELD BATTLE BUT McLAREN LOOMS\n\nNo-one expects Alex Albon to be fighting for the podium in his Williams, but the car\u2019s one-lap pace looked genuinely worthy of a Q3 spot on Saturday, which could upset several midfield rivals.\n\nRelative to Verstappen, Albon was consistently quicker on corner exit before ethe RB19\u2019s super-effective DRS got it ahead on pure top speed.\n\nThe Williams car lacks downforce, but recent upgrades also appear to have dialled drag out of the aero, which is counting for much at this high-efficiency circuit.\n\nAverage lap times, mediums\n\nAlpine: 1:34.556 (7 laps)\n\nWilliams: 1:34.597 (10 laps)\n\nHaas: 1:35.049 (5 laps)\n\nAlfa Romeo: 1:35.168 (7 laps)\n\nThere\u2019s a more interesting battle brewing looking at the hard-tyre simulations. Other than Aston Martin, only the midfield teams sampled the hardest compound.\n\nLando Norris, equipped with the second phase of McLaren\u2019s major upgrade package, suggested at this early stage of the weekend that the car might\u2019ve taken a step towards the front of the midfield battle.\n\nAverage lap times, hards\n\nMcLaren: 1:33.992 (8 laps)\n\nWilliams: 1:34.459 (12 laps)\n\nAlpine: 1:34.480 (11 laps)\n\nAston Martin: 1:34.501 (8 laps)\n\nAlphaTauri: 1:34.616 (7 laps)\n\nHaas: 1:35.014 (17 laps)\n\nOscar Piastri conducted his long run on the soft tyre, where he was on average about a second slower than Max Verstappen, but neither Alpine nor Williams executed representative runs for comparison.\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT?\n\nThe British Grand Prix is live an ad-break free during racing on Kayo and Fox Sports.\n\nFinal practice takes places at 8:30pm tonight, with qualifying at midnight Sunday morning.\n\nPre-race coverage starts at 10:30pm Sunday, with lights out for the British Grand Prix at midnight Monday morning.",

He also sold one of his cars to raise money for \u2018Wings for Life\u2019, an international not-for-profit spinal cord research foundation.\n\nIn 2020, Max Verstappen made a donation to a fundraiser as part of aid for Koalas who were affected by the bushfires in Australia. The amount he donated remains unspecified.\n\n(Main and Featured Image Credits: Courtesy Instagram/@Max Verstappen)",

            "article_html": "<div><p>Had Honda not been so hasty in quitting F1 in the first place, or been prompter in approving its return, then&#160;Red&#160;Bull&#160;would have had no need to do its own thing on the engine front and commit hundreds of millions of pounds to its new Powertrains division.&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>It was no wonder that <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/driver/max-verstappen/829269/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Max Verstappen</a>&#8217;s first response to the news of Honda staying in F1 was to suggest it was a <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/verstappen-hondas-aston-martin-f1-move-a-bit-of-a-shame/10473382/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bit of a &#8216;shame&#8217; the way the situation played out</a>.&#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think from our side, of course, it's a bit unfortunate how all of that turned out because a few years ago, they say we're going to stop, so then&#160;Red&#160;Bull&#160;sets up its own engine division, and then at one point they say no, we continue,&#8221; he said at the Monaco Grand Prix.&#160;</p>\n<p>\"Unfortunately, once you're already in the process of building a whole engine yourself, you can't really work together anymore. It's a bit of a shame, I would say.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n<p>From the perspective of&#160;Red&#160;Bull&#8217;s team management, it was a no-brainer to understand that things would have certainly been an awful lot cheaper if Honda had elected to stay put.&#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was certainly an expensive decision,&#8221; smiled&#160;Red&#160;Bull&#160;team boss Christian Horner about the call to go down the Powertrains route.&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>But F1 is not a sport where success is achieved by doing things on the cheap. &#160;</p>\n<p>While&#160;Red&#160;Bull&#160;has certainly had to dig deep into its pockets to follow <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/team/mercedes/36495/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mercedes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/team/ferrari/36466/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ferrari</a> and <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/team/alpine/39174/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alpine</a> in producing both cars and engines, there are clear benefits from it that remain priceless.&#160;</p>\n<p>Chief among them, which also proved to be a factor in why its talks with Porsche over a 2026 engine deal collapsed at the 11th hour, was in&#160;Red&#160;Bull&#160;being fully in control of the future.&#160;</p>\n   <img src=\"//cdn-1.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YN19B1j2/s1000/red-bull-x-ford-hero-1.jpg\" alt=\"Red Bull Ford Powertrains logo\"> \n<p class=\"title\">Red Bull Ford Powertrains logo</p>\n<p class=\"photographer\">Photo by: Red Bull Racing</p>\n<p>After years where its fortunes have ebbed and flowed based on the competitiveness of its engine partner -&#160;&#160;just witness the highs and lows with Renault &#8211; it knew that if it wanted to become a permanent force at the front, then it needed to be in charge of what went in the back of its car.&#160;</p>\n<p>As Horner told Autosport recently about the benefits from the investment: &#8220;It's hugely ambitious, but I think it is about taking control of our own destiny for the longer term. &#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;When Honda decided to withdraw from this sport, that left us with a predicament of either going back to being a customer team, or do we use this as the moment with a new set of regulations for 2026 to invest in a cost cap environment? &#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>&#8220;For the future, having chassis and engine all on one site, puts us in a unique position other than Ferrari of having everything housed on one campus.

            "text": "Had Honda not been so hasty in quitting F1 in the first place, or been prompter in approving its return, then Red Bull would have had no need to do its own thing on the engine front and commit hundreds of millions of pounds to its new Powertrains division.\n\nIt was no wonder that Max Verstappen\u2019s first response to the news of Honda staying in F1 was to suggest it was a bit of a \u2018shame\u2019 the way the situation played out.\n\n\u201cI think from our side, of course, it's a bit unfortunate how all of that turned out because a few years ago, they say we're going to stop, so then Red Bull sets up its own engine division, and then at one point they say no, we continue,\u201d he said at the Monaco Grand Prix.\n\n\"Unfortunately, once you're already in the process of building a whole engine yourself, you can't really work together anymore. It's a bit of a shame, I would say.\u201d\n\nFrom the perspective of Red Bull\u2019s team management, it was a no-brainer to understand that things would have certainly been an awful lot cheaper if Honda had elected to stay put.\n\n\u201cIt was certainly an expensive decision,\u201d smiled Red Bull team boss Christian Horner about the call to go down the Powertrains route.\n\nBut F1 is not a sport where success is achieved by doing things on the cheap.\n\nWhile Red Bull has certainly had to dig deep into its pockets to follow Mercedes, Ferrari and Alpine in producing both cars and engines, there are clear benefits from it that remain priceless.\n\nChief among them, which also proved to be a factor in why its talks with Porsche over a 2026 engine deal collapsed at the 11th hour, was in Red Bull being fully in control of the future.\n\nRed Bull Ford Powertrains logo Photo by: Red Bull Racing\n\nAfter years where its fortunes have ebbed and flowed based on the competitiveness of its engine partner - just witness the highs and lows with Renault \u2013 it knew that if it wanted to become a permanent force at the front, then it needed to be in charge of what went in the back of its car.\n\nAs Horner told Autosport recently about the benefits from the investment: \u201cIt's hugely ambitious, but I think it is about taking control of our own destiny for the longer term.\n\n\u201cWhen Honda decided to withdraw from this sport, that left us with a predicament of either going back to being a customer team, or do we use this as the moment with a new set of regulations for 2026 to invest in a cost cap environment?\n\n\u201cFor the future, having chassis and engine all on one site, puts us in a unique position other than Ferrari of having everything housed on one campus. There are efficiencies and synergies that that creates, and not even Mercedes in chassis and engine have common ownership, or are on the same campus.\n\n\u201cYes, there's going to be some short-term pain as we are effectively the first startup engine business for probably 25 years in the UK, but that's part of the excitement of the challenge as well.\u201d\n\nBeyond the fact that Powertrains gives Red Bull the control it has lacked ever since it entered F1, there will also be incremental gains in terms of its actual car.\n\nWith Aston Martin having made clear in its Honda announcement that the 2026 rules will demand closer integration than ever before between power unit and chassis, Red Bull knows that going back to being a customer was not something it could counter.\n\n\u201cYou don't have that control over your supplier,\u201d added Horner.\n\n\u201cI think that we've enjoyed a great partnership with Honda and, having experienced what essentially a works partnership could look like, and the benefits of it, it would be very hard to go back to being dictated what the layout should be.\u201d\n\nRed Bull Racing Team Principal Christian Horner shakes hands with Jim Farley, CEO of Ford on the grid Photo by: Red Bull Content Pool\n\nPerhaps the biggest positive from Red Bull\u2019s powertrains approach is that it has ended up in a scenario where it has got the best of both worlds: there is manufacturer support on board with Ford having joined the project, but there is no downside to it being dictated to in terms of end product.\n\n\u201cIt's a straightforward partnership,\u201d explained Horner. \u201cThey're bringing knowhow in areas that we don't have expertise, particularly in battery cell technology.\n\n\u201cAnd the enthusiasm that they add that has been throughout the organisation has been phenomenal.

Three times he&#8217;s been eliminated in the bottom five of the grid.</p><p>We&#8217;re well past the point of considering what effect this is having on his long-faded championship aspirations. The damage is now all reputational.</p><p>There were several crucial factors behind P&#233;rez&#8217;s latest failure, and while not all of them are owned directly by him, responsibility is overwhelmingly sheeted home to the Mexican.</p><p>His first mistake came in the damp opening phase of Q1, when he failed to set a competitive lap time.</p><p>When the red flag was called with three minutes on the clock, P&#233;rez was 1.4 seconds slower than the then session-leading Verstappen.</p><p>That put him under pressure to deliver with just a single flying lap to make the cut.</p><p class=\"ecpz18-0 fEGMZh\"></p><p>Here&#8217;s where the team&#8217;s influence on the result comes in.</p><p>P&#233;rez was sent to the end of the pit lane to ensure he didn&#8217;t get caught in traffic, but this had two negative effects. The first was it allowed his tyres cool significantly ahead of that crucial lap. The second was that it put him on the track at the worst time, when the circuit was slowest.</p><p>The track was drying rapidly as the sun broke through the clouds at this point. The ideal time to set a lap was at the very last moment, not the first.</p><p>But it would be an exaggeration to say this set him up to fail.</p><p>Directly behind him on the track was Alex Albon, who was therefore dealing with very similar conditions.

The two DRS zones will also play to his strengths.</p><p>And he showed in Austria that he&#8217;s capable of a big recovery, having risen from 15th to third.</p><p>&#8220;I think we had a very good Friday in terms of pace, so hopefully we are able to find that,&#8221; he said hopefully, noting that in the dry he was much more confident.</p><p>But that confidence looks so fleeting these days.</p><p class=\"ecpz18-0 bfbmyA\"></p><p></p><p><b>BRITAIN PROMISES UNPREDICTABLE BATTLE FOR THE PODIUM</b></p><p>Behind McLaren you can still see the usual signs we&#8217;ve become used to this season after a qualifying session.</p><p>Ferrari headed the rest of the pack on single lap pace, and Charles Leclerc probably could&#8217;ve pipped Norris had he not made a single mistake at Stowe, where he ran wide onto the wet kerbs and lost a bundle of time. He&#8217;d been neck and neck with Verstappen through Maggotts and Becketts.</p><p>But that mistake having been made, Ferrari ended up at the head of a tight battle with Mercedes, which showed up better than expected after a very difficult Friday.</p><p>On paper both teams are quicker than McLaren on race pace &#8212; notwithstanding the opaque Friday data &#8212; and Mercedes is probably faster than Ferrari.</p><p class=\"ecpz18-0 kMdhGx\"></p><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to be chasing McLaren, and Mercedes is going to be chasing McLaren and us, so think it&#8217;s going to be quite an exciting race,&#8221; Carlos Sainz told Sky Sports.</p><p class=\"sc-15rcxg2-2 hnVLJB\">Whincup reveals SVG's huge Nascar plans | 06:58</p><p></p><p>Combined with the prospect of P&#233;rez slicing through the field, it should be a fascinating podium battle behind Verstappen.</p><p>But there&#8217;s also the added element of Aston Martin, which struggled to its most underwhelming qualifying result of the year.

A double top five or even double podium would be a remarkable statement result.\n\nMercedes boss Toto Wolff said: \u201cMcLaren have taken a massive step clearly so we need to see if that consolidates.\n\n\u201cThey are a force to be reckoned with now.\u201d\n\nRegardless of what happens next, Piastri summed it up: \u201cFrom where we were at the start of the season to where we are now is a massive step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nAnd for those who insist that they saw this strong result coming, here\u2019s some help with today\u2019s bold prediction.\n\nThe last time McLaren drivers started second and third on the grid, Daniel Ricciardo led Norris to a one-two finish at the 2021 Italian Grand Prix.\n\nSERGIO P\u00c9REZ FLOPS AGAIN\n\nRed Bull Racing\u2019s RB19 has taken every pole bar one so far this season.\n\nSergio P\u00e9rez has failed to make the top 10 six times this season. Three times he\u2019s been eliminated in the bottom five of the grid.\n\nWe\u2019re well past the point of considering what effect this is having on his long-faded championship aspirations. The damage is now all reputational.\n\nThere were several crucial factors behind P\u00e9rez\u2019s latest failure, and while not all of them are owned directly by him, responsibility is overwhelmingly sheeted home to the Mexican.\n\nHis first mistake came in the damp opening phase of Q1, when he failed to set a competitive lap time.\n\nWhen the red flag was called with three minutes on the clock, P\u00e9rez was 1.4 seconds slower than the then session-leading Verstappen.\n\nThat put him under pressure to deliver with just a single flying lap to make the cut.\n\nHere\u2019s where the team\u2019s influence on the result comes in.\n\nP\u00e9rez was sent to the end of the pit lane to ensure he didn\u2019t get caught in traffic, but this had two negative effects. The first was it allowed his tyres cool significantly ahead of that crucial lap. The second was that it put him on the track at the worst time, when the circuit was slowest.\n\nThe track was drying rapidly as the sun broke through the clouds at this point. The ideal time to set a lap was at the very last moment, not the first.\n\nBut it would be an exaggeration to say this set him up to fail.\n\nDirectly behind him on the track was Alex Albon, who was therefore dealing with very similar conditions. The Thai driver set a time 0.502 seconds quicker.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m struggling in these conditions in the car lately,\u201d P\u00e9rez told Sky Sports. \u201cI think my problems with the car become more apparent in these conditions.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s something we\u2019ve got to understand as a group to try and figure out and try to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nCan he salvage a result from here?\n\nHe has the car to do it, and Silverstone certainly facilitates overtaking. The two DRS zones will also play to his strengths.\n\nAnd he showed in Austria that he\u2019s capable of a big recovery, having risen from 15th to third.\n\n\u201cI think we had a very good Friday in terms of pace, so hopefully we are able to find that,\u201d he said hopefully, noting that in the dry he was much more confident.\n\nBut that confidence looks so fleeting these days.\n\nBRITAIN PROMISES UNPREDICTABLE BATTLE FOR THE PODIUM\n\nBehind McLaren you can still see the usual signs we\u2019ve become used to this season after a qualifying session.\n\nFerrari headed the rest of the pack on single lap pace, and Charles Leclerc probably could\u2019ve pipped Norris had he not made a single mistake at Stowe, where he ran wide onto the wet kerbs and lost a bundle of time. He\u2019d been neck and neck with Verstappen through Maggotts and Becketts.\n\nBut that mistake having been made, Ferrari ended up at the head of a tight battle with Mercedes, which showed up better than expected after a very difficult Friday.\n\nOn paper both teams are quicker than McLaren on race pace \u2014 notwithstanding the opaque Friday data \u2014 and Mercedes is probably faster than Ferrari.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be chasing McLaren, and Mercedes is going to be chasing McLaren and us, so think it\u2019s going to be quite an exciting race,\u201d Carlos Sainz told Sky Sports.\n\nWhincup reveals SVG's huge Nascar plans | 06:58\n\nCombined with the prospect of P\u00e9rez slicing through the field, it should be a fascinating podium battle behind Verstappen.\n\nBut there\u2019s also the added element of Aston Martin, which struggled to its most underwhelming qualifying result of the year. Ninth is Fernando Alonso\u2019s equal worst qualifying position and will give him his outright worst grid spot for 2023.\n\nHe\u2019s not just back behind the factory Mercedes team, he\u2019s also behind the superb Alex Albon too, and we\u2019ve learnt from so many races that the Thai driver is a ferocious defender.\n\n\u201cIt was not a good day obviously,\u201d Alonso told Sky Sports. \u201cNothing we can do now. Let\u2019s hope for a better race tomorrow and to score some good points.\n\n\u201cIt seems like we have to have to be on a defensive strategy this weekend.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first substandard weekend Aston Martin has had this year, but it certainly feels like the team has lost a little bit of the initiative it burst from the blocks with. Just a tiny bit of air has escaped the balloon \u2014 certainly if McLaren has made a genuine jump forward.\n\nIt\u2019s come as Ferrari, Mercedes and now McLaren have all brought big upgrades.\n\n\u201cSome of our competition really improved the car and brought a lot of new parts. That\u2019s one reason,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cThe second reason is track specific.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t perform in Barcelona, Austria and Silverstone. All three of them are a little bit similar in terms of track characteristics.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT?\n\nPre-race coverage starts at 10:30pm Sunday, with lights out for the British Grand Prix at midnight Monday morning.\n\n",

What's more, the Bahrain International Circuit is a known outlier on the F1 schedule, with an unusually rough track surface and traction-heavy layout that punishes rear tyres more than any other track on the calendar.</p><p>Along with Alonso's Aston Martin, Red Bull was the only team to effectively manage the degradation of its rear tyres in Sunday's race, making the win look remarkably easy. The next round in Saudi Arabia puts much less of a toll on the rear tyres, and while it is also an unusual circuit compared to the vast majority of tracks F1 visits, there's the potential for some of Red Bull's advantage to be curbed in Jeddah.</p><p>\"Saudi is quite a different track to this one,\" Verstappen said. \"You have a lot more straights, fast corners, and a lot less deg. And I think here we were particularly good on the deg. So I do expect in terms of race pace that everyone is closer in Jeddah, yeah.</p><p>\"Our car seems quite strong in high-speed, but I think the Ferrari is quite quick on the straight, which in Jeddah is very nice to have, let's say it like that.</p><p>\"But yeah, time will tell.

Meanwhile, the rest of the drivers in the top eight had no choice but to use one set of softs followed by two sets of hards to get to the finish. Put simply, Red Bull's competitors wouldn't have been able to make the same tyre strategy work without facing a disastrous performance drop off.</p><p>\"We focused a little more on the race [with the setup] than we did on quali and that paid us dividends today,\" Horner said. \"So we were able to run on the softer compound, particularly in the middle part of the race and still have the durability.\"</p><p>Perhaps the biggest concern for Red Bull's rivals is that Verstappen never really pushed the limits of his car.

However, most of the allure that comes with Las Vegas was missing from the race. The track was relatively flat and uninspiring, and the hosts felt that lack of motivation.

However, the race rarely drew any European drivers, so primarily Americans participated in the event. The Indianapolis Motor Speedway didn&#8217;t return to the F1 ranks until 2000, when the United States Grand Prix returned and was hosted at the circuit. After the 2007 United States Grand Prix, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and F1 Announced that there would be no more Grand Prix at the racetrack for the foreseeable future as the two parties could not agree on terms that pleased both sides.</p></p></p><p class=\"inline-heading__chapter\">05</p><h2 class=\"inline-heading inline-heading__title inline-heading--level-1\" id=\"5-phoenix-street-circuit-in-phoenix-arizona\">Phoenix Street Circuit in Phoenix, Arizona </h2><ul class=\"inline-enumeration inline-enumeration--bullet\"><li class=\"inline-enumeration__item\"><p class=\"inline-enumeration__item-content\"><p><p class=\"inline-enumeration__text\">Years hosted: 1989-1991</p></p></p></li><li class=\"inline-enumeration__item\"><p class=\"inline-enumeration__item-content\"><p><p class=\"inline-enumeration__text\">Most wins: Ayrton Senna (2; 1990 &amp; 1991)</p></p></p></li></ul><p class=\"inline-paragraph\"><p><p class=\"inline-paragraph__text\">After the downfall of Watkins Glen, Formula One tried several locations to find a long-term home in American circuits. The circuit&#8217;s final attempt of the twentieth century was in Phoenix. Reviving the United States Grand Prix title for the race in Phoenix, it fell apart rather quickly. The race didn&#8217;t draw that big of a crowd, and the city had no winding bends or turns that would bring out the traditional F1 flair. The exit of F1 was somewhat controversial as race officials expected the race to be run in 1992. However, the race was canceled in October 1991 after three years and was replaced on the schedule by the South African Grand Prix.</p></p></p><p class=\"inline-heading__chapter\">06</p><h2 class=\"inline-heading inline-heading__title inline-heading--level-1\" id=\"6-detroit-street-circuit-in-detroit-michigan\">Detroit Street Circuit in Detroit, Michigan </h2><ul class=\"inline-enumeration inline-enumeration--bullet\"><li class=\"inline-enumeration__item\"><p class=\"inline-enumeration__item-content\"><p><p class=\"inline-enumeration__text\">Years hosted: 1982-1988</p></p></p></li><li class=\"inline-enumeration__item\"><p class=\"inline-enumeration__item-content\"><p><p class=\"inline-enumeration__text\">Most wins: Ayrton Senna (3; 1986-1988)</p></p></p></li></ul><p class=\"inline-paragraph\"><p><p class=\"inline-paragraph__text\">In 1982, the United States became the first country to host three World Championship Grand Prix&#8217;s in one campaign when Detroit was added to a rotation of Las Vegas and Long Beach. However, the Detroit Grand Prix may have been the worst of the three. The track had several difficult turns and was very tight in some areas, causing several drivers to retire due to mechanical failure or colliding with the walls. The track also suffered due to the humidity and heat of the race. Only six drivers finished the 1984 Detroit Grand Prix out of a starting field of 26. After disagreements between F1&#8217;s governing body and the City of Detroit about the building of facilities, the last Detroit Grand Prix was held in 1988, with F1 deeming the circuit of being more trouble than it was worth.</p></p></p><p class=\"inline-heading__chapter\">07</p><h2 class=\"inline-heading inline-heading__title inline-heading--level-1\" id=\"7-dallas-fair-park-in-dallas-texas\">Dallas Fair Park in Dallas, Texas </h2><ul class=\"inline-enumeration inline-enumeration--bullet\"><li class=\"inline-enumeration__item\"><p class=\"inline-enumeration__item-content\"><p><p class=\"inline-enumeration__text\">Years hosted: 1984</p></p></p></li><li class=\"inline-enumeration__item\"><p class=\"inline-enumeration__item-content\"><p><p class=\"inline-enumeration__text\">Most wins: Keke Rosberg</p></p></p></li></ul><p class=\"inline-paragraph\"><p><p class=\"inline-paragraph__text\">Formula One&#8217;s lone race hosted in Dallas didn&#8217;t give the series the greatest first impression of the Lone Star state.

With the race happening so late in the season and championships already tied up, race promoters offered large sums of money for racers to participate, making it just as popular for drivers as it was for the fans. A redesign of the track in 1971 made it a much more challenging race, thus making the circuit even more appealing to fans and drivers. However, Watkins Glen&#8217;s good fortunes began to sour shortly thereafter. Following fatal crashes at the 1974 and 1975 race weekends, the circuit began to lose its allure, with drivers and media concerned about the track&#8217;s deteriorating condition and the rowdy fans who often committed destructive acts during race weekends. By the time Watkins Glen made a push to make improvements to the circuit, it was too little too late. The 1981 United States Grand Prix was canceled, and F1 never returned to Watkins Glen.</p></p></p><p class=\"inline-heading__chapter\">10</p><h2 class=\"inline-heading inline-heading__title inline-heading--level-1\" id=\"10-riverside-international-raceway-in-moreno-valley-california\">Riverside International Raceway in Moreno Valley, California </h2><ul class=\"inline-enumeration inline-enumeration--bullet\"><li class=\"inline-enumeration__item\"><p class=\"inline-enumeration__item-content\"><p><p class=\"inline-enumeration__text\">Years hosted: 1960</p></p></p></li><li class=\"inline-enumeration__item\"><p class=\"inline-enumeration__item-content\"><p><p class=\"inline-enumeration__text\">Most wins: Stirling Moss</p></p></p></li></ul><p class=\"inline-paragraph\"><p><p class=\"inline-paragraph__text\">Trying to generate publicity for the new &#8220;United States Grand Prix,&#8221; race organizer Alec Ulmann held the second installment of the race at Riverside in sunny Southern California.

The debuting 1959 United States Grand Prix drew less than 8,000 spectators, but the race itself wasn&#8217;t bad, as Bruce McLaren won by less than a second to become the youngest driver (at the time) to ever win a F1 race at 22 years, 104 days.

            "text": "As Verstappen finally crossed the finish line to clinch P1 in the cagey Miami race, he told his team over the headset, \u201cThat was nice. Tough one but really good.\u201d\n\nRed Bull Racing team at the Miami International Autodrome \u00a9 Getty Images / Red Bull Content Pool\n\nFormula One hasn\u2019t always been a mainstay in American circuits. Since 2000, only four United States circuits have hosted F1 races , and there was a span from 2008-2011 when no races were held in the United States.\n\nThis article will look at the 11 tracks that hosted Formula One races across the United States. This list includes how many races were run at each location and who won those races. Buckle up, race fans!\n\n01 Miami International Autodrome in Miami, Florida\n\nYears hosted: 2022-Present\n\nMost wins: Max Verstappen\n\nMax Verstappen at F1 Grand Prix of Miami at Miami International Autodrome \u00a9 Getty Images / Red Bull Content Pool\n\nStephen Ross, the owner of both the Hard Rock Stadium and its tenant Miami Dolphins, had been trying to attract Formula One to Miami for years. After initially planning the race to be held in Downtown Miami, the race was moved north to the Miami International Autodrome, a track built around the Hard Rock Stadium. Max Verstappen won the inaugural Miami Grand Prix in front of about 85,000 people, including stars like Serena Williams, Michael Jordan, and David Beckham. Drivers spoke glowingly of the support from U.S. fans and the track design. The circuit is temporary, meaning that once the race is done, all of the infrastructure, like fencing and tire barriers, are removed. Miami Grand Prix 2023 will be returning to Miami on May 4-6, 2023.\n\n02 Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas\n\nYears hosted: 2012-2019, 2021-Present\n\nMost wins: Lewis Hamilton (5; 2012, 2014-2017)\n\nF1 Grand Prix of USA at Circuit of The Americas 2021 in Austin, Texas \u00a9 Getty Images / Red Bull Content Pool\n\n1When Formula One left the United States in 2007, then-president Bernie Ecclestone said the series would never return to Indianapolis, leaving doubt about whether F1 would ever return to American circuits. However, following a four-year hiatus, F1 returned for the 2012 Season, coming to Austin, Texas, at the Circuit of the Americas or COTA. The track was purposely built with F1 racing in mind, and drivers have taken to it nicely. Red Bull Racing driver Daniel Ricciardo called the circuit \u201cthe best of the new breed of circuits.\u201d F1 will be returning to the Circuit of the Americas in Austin on October 19-21, 2023.\n\n03 Caesars Palace Grand Prix Circuit in Las Vegas, Nevada\n\nYears hosted: 1981-1982, 2023\n\nMost wins: Alan Jones (1981) & Michele Alboreto (1982)\n\nLas Vegas Grand Prix Formula One World Championship 2022 Car Launch \u00a9 Garth Milan / Red Bull Content Pool\n\nSome gambles don\u2019t pay off, and what better place to learn that than Las Vegas! The track is located in the parking lot of the Caesars Palace hotel. The Caesars Palace Grand Prix debuted in 1981 after the sudden removal of Watkins Glen from the calendar due to bankruptcy. However, most of the allure that comes with Las Vegas was missing from the race. The track was relatively flat and uninspiring, and the hosts felt that lack of motivation. The 1981 event was a financial loss for the Caesars Palace hotel with low crowd numbers, and F1 left Vegas after two years. After over 40 years, F1 will return to Sin City on November 16-18, 2023, as the Las Vegas Grand Prix will look to capture more of the city\u2019s magic, with the custom-built track including a sizable chunk of the Las Vegas Strip.\n\n04 Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Indianapolis, Indiana\n\nYears hosted: 1950-60, 2000-2007\n\nMost wins: Michael Schumaker (5; 2000, 2003-2006)\n\nFrom 1950-1960, the Indy 500 was a part of the Formula One World Championships. However, the race rarely drew any European drivers, so primarily Americans participated in the event. The Indianapolis Motor Speedway didn\u2019t return to the F1 ranks until 2000, when the United States Grand Prix returned and was hosted at the circuit. After the 2007 United States Grand Prix, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and F1 Announced that there would be no more Grand Prix at the racetrack for the foreseeable future as the two parties could not agree on terms that pleased both sides.\n\n05 Phoenix Street Circuit in Phoenix, Arizona\n\nYears hosted: 1989-1991\n\nMost wins: Ayrton Senna (2; 1990 & 1991)\n\nAfter the downfall of Watkins Glen, Formula One tried several locations to find a long-term home in American circuits. The circuit\u2019s final attempt of the twentieth century was in Phoenix. Reviving the United States Grand Prix title for the race in Phoenix, it fell apart rather quickly. The race didn\u2019t draw that big of a crowd, and the city had no winding bends or turns that would bring out the traditional F1 flair. The exit of F1 was somewhat controversial as race officials expected the race to be run in 1992. However, the race was canceled in October 1991 after three years and was replaced on the schedule by the South African Grand Prix.\n\n06 Detroit Street Circuit in Detroit, Michigan\n\nYears hosted: 1982-1988\n\nMost wins: Ayrton Senna (3; 1986-1988)\n\nIn 1982, the United States became the first country to host three World Championship Grand Prix\u2019s in one campaign when Detroit was added to a rotation of Las Vegas and Long Beach. However, the Detroit Grand Prix may have been the worst of the three. The track had several difficult turns and was very tight in some areas, causing several drivers to retire due to mechanical failure or colliding with the walls. The track also suffered due to the humidity and heat of the race. Only six drivers finished the 1984 Detroit Grand Prix out of a starting field of 26. After disagreements between F1\u2019s governing body and the City of Detroit about the building of facilities, the last Detroit Grand Prix was held in 1988, with F1 deeming the circuit of being more trouble than it was worth.\n\n07 Dallas Fair Park in Dallas, Texas\n\nYears hosted: 1984\n\nMost wins: Keke Rosberg\n\nFormula One\u2019s lone race hosted in Dallas didn\u2019t give the series the greatest first impression of the Lone Star state. With the race happening in the middle of summer, the heat quickly became unbearable for both drivers and the track. With the track temperature surpassing 150 degrees Fahrenheit, the track began to disintegrate, with gravel being strewn across the circuit and causing cars to slip and lose positioning. Only seven racers of the starting 26 finished the race. F1 has never returned.\n\n08 Long Beach Street Circuit in Long Beach, California\n\nYears hosted: 1976-1983\n\nMost wins: Clay Regazzoni (1976), Mario Andretti (1977), Carlos Reutermann (1978), Gilles Villeneuve (1979), Nelson Piquet (1980), Alan Jones (1981), Niki Lauda (1982), John Watson (1983)\n\nFormula One wanted an American circuit that was relatively drama-free yet still lucrative. In comes the Long Beach Street Circuit and the United States Grand Prix West was born. The race had a rather successful run from 1976-1983 and was widely popular among both fans and drivers, but race organizers deemed the IndyCar Series to be a better investment and made the switch for the 1984 IndyCar Series campaign.\n\n09 Watkins Glen International in Watkins Glen, New York\n\nYears hosted: 1961-1980\n\nMost wins: Jim Clark (3; 1962, 1966, 1967) & Graham Hill (3; 1963-1965)\n\nEasily the most successful installment of the United States Grand Prix came at Watkins Glen in upstate New York, that was up until the 2022 USGP at COTA which set record-breaking attendance. The race was an immediate success, with over 60,000 fans showing up to the first United States Grand Prix held there in 1961.

By the time Watkins Glen made a push to make improvements to the circuit, it was too little too late. The 1981 United States Grand Prix was canceled, and F1 never returned to Watkins Glen.\n\n10 Riverside International Raceway in Moreno Valley, California\n\nYears hosted: 1960\n\nMost wins: Stirling Moss\n\nTrying to generate publicity for the new \u201cUnited States Grand Prix,\u201d race organizer Alec Ulmann held the second installment of the race at Riverside in sunny Southern California. However, the event was unable to drum up the publicity required to make it profitable. Race organizers even had to pay the drivers out of their own pockets to ensure the event didn\u2019t become a total embarrassment.\n\n11 Sebring International Raceway in Sebring, Florida\n\nYears hosted: 1959\n\nMost wins: Bruce McLaren\n\nSebring International Raceway is the location for several popular and prestigious events in the world of racing. However, its lone stint as the host location for the United States Grand Prix was less than glamorous, primarily due to its location. Sebring, which had a population of less than 7,000 according to the 1960 U.S. Census, is over an hour away from any major city in Florida. The debuting 1959 United States Grand Prix drew less than 8,000 spectators, but the race itself wasn\u2019t bad, as Bruce McLaren won by less than a second to become the youngest driver (at the time) to ever win a F1 race at 22 years, 104 days. This record would stand for more than 40 years.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe United States and Formula One have had a relationship over the past 54 years. The 2023 Formula One World Championships is slated to have three races held in the United States, including returns to Miami and Austin, where Sergio P\u00e9rez finished fourth in both races last year. This will make the United States the first country ever to host three Formula One races in more than one World Championship campaign.",

That is partly because of the technology available but also the new owners [are] involved more [and] focusing on the fans and the show side of things.</p><p class=\"Ekqk yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv\"><strong>ABC News:</strong> Let's talk about Netflix's \"Drive to Survive.\" What has your experience been like on the show?</p><p class=\"Ekqk yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv\"><strong>Max:</strong> Yeah, it's been a ride.

It doesn't matter if it's Formula 1 or a GT car or a prototype car, I just enjoy really getting the best out of myself but also getting the best out of the car.

You hope you have good results most of the time. But you know, there are also bad results. And I've been experiencing that from [age] 7 till now.

Some people just don't have the material to fight up front, which is a bit of a shame but that's how Formula 1 has always been. And I actually think that it's getting closer and closer to the 80s and 90s and the early 2000s, when there was a lot of dominance.</p><p class=\"Ekqk yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv\">We know that we have a great car again this year but the focus is always the same.

            "text": "Max Verstappen could win his 38th Formula 1 Grand Prix on Sunday in Miami, Florida. The 25-year-old defending champion is leading in points this season and is on track to win his third consecutive world champion title -- if he and his Red Bull team continue to execute at a level unmatched on the grid.\n\nVerstappen, who has been competing in Formula 1 since he was 17 years old, recognizes the sport can be unpredictable, maddening and cutthroat. Cars often break down. Rival teams gain an edge. Grueling race schedules can affect performance.\n\n\"You learn from bad and good results,\" he told ABC News before the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. \"That is the key. Even when you have good results, you always have to look back and analyze what you could have done better or what you would have wished to have done differently.\"\n\nVerstappen has also seen his popularity skyrocket as Formula 1 grows its fan base in the U.S. \"Drive to Survive,\" Netflix's docuseries on the sport, raised the profiles of Verstappen and his fellow drivers, turning them into celebrities and reality TV stars.\n\nVerstappen spoke with ABC News about the pressures on the grid, his jet-setting race schedule and what it's like to film \"Drive to Survive.\" The conversation below has been edited.\n\nABC News: How has Formula 1 changed since you first started in the sport?\n\nMax: I think it did shift a little bit more toward fan engagement, especially in the U.S. compared to other areas of the world, which I think in general has been really good for the sport. That is partly because of the technology available but also the new owners [are] involved more [and] focusing on the fans and the show side of things.\n\nABC News: Let's talk about Netflix's \"Drive to Survive.\" What has your experience been like on the show?\n\nMax: Yeah, it's been a ride. I mean, I think we had to clear a few things up, you know, before getting back on it. I gave one interview last year because I understand that it's important for [the producers] to try and create a bit of a picture.\n\nSome people ... love being a bit more in the spotlight and some don't. I just enjoy my privacy. And I enjoy being at home and being away from Formula 1 when I'm not racing.\n\nMax Verstappen of Oracle Red Bull Racing celebrates on the podium after winning the Formula 1 World Championship at Yas Marina Circuit on Dec. 12, 2021, in Abu Dhabi. Dan Istitene/Formula 1 via Getty Images, FILE\n\nABC News: Are you part of filming for this current season?\n\nMax: Not yet. We'll do something again a bit later on in the year.\n\nABC News: When you say clear some things up, what do you mean by that?\n\nMax: It was just how things were portrayed before in the early seasons, where it was basically creating a bit of a wrong picture. But it was to create a bit more excitement, I guess, for the show. I just want [the producers] to show me how I really am or at least as close as possible to it.\n\nI'm very straightforward. And I will say what I think. Sometimes that might seem arrogant to some people but that's just the way I was brought up. And I always learned that you have to speak out. If you really want something or you want something changed, at the end of the day, it's better to say [it] quite directly.\n\nMax Verstappen of the Netherlands driving the Aston Martin Red Bull Racing RB15 on track during qualifying for the F1 Grand Prix of Brazil at Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace on Nov. 16, 2019 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Charles Coates/Getty Images, FILE\n\nABC News: \"Drive to Survive\" has really boosted Americans' interest in Formula 1. What's your opinion of the Miami track?\n\nMax: It's a great event. Miami feels quite different to Austin even though it's the same country. I love being in Miami. It's nice and warm and that makes it also a tough track to drive in general.\n\nABC News: Do you enjoy driving when you're not competing? Do you have your own personal car?\n\nMax: Well, I do a lot of virtual racing at home. I spend a lot of hours on that. And when I'm at home, I don't actually drive a lot. But I don't mind being the passenger as long as I trust the driver. Then you can actually relax quite well.\n\nI have some personal cars ... a few sports cars. But the one I use the most is an Audi RS Q3, which I actually bought for my girlfriend. When I need to get into town in Monaco I actually use it myself because it's a bit easier to park and when you hit a curb or whatever, it doesn't feel as bad as damaging a wheel on another car.\n\nABC News: That makes me feel better that you also hit curbs.\n\nMax: We all do.\n\nABC News: Can sim racing really prepare you for the pressures on the track and the G forces?\n\nMax: Not the G forces. But I do think it keeps you really on top of things.\n\nI just enjoy racing. It doesn't matter if it's Formula 1 or a GT car or a prototype car, I just enjoy really getting the best out of myself but also getting the best out of the car. And it doesn't matter if it's real life or virtual. It's a hobby but I also want to win. I take it very seriously.\n\nABC News: Do you have any pre-race rituals?\n\nMax: No, not really. I mean, I just go through my normal warmup in terms of just getting your body ready.\n\nRed Bull Racing Team Principal Christian Horner talks with Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle Red Bull Racing during day two of F1 Testing at Bahrain International Circuit on Feb. 24, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

In the lead up to this, Red Bull had taken to coating the fairing and caliper with a different paint too.\n\nRed Bull Racing RB18 new floor detail Photo by: Giorgio Piola\n\nIf you described the two outer floor fences as married in their configuration up until this point, you\u2019d now consider them divorced, as Red Bull ditched the novel solution at the French Grand Prix.\n\nRed Bull Racing RB18 beam wing detail with arrows Photo by: Giorgio Piola\n\nTo help reduce downforce and drag, the beam wing\u2019s upper element was amended for the French Grand Prix (black arrow), whilst it\u2019s also worth noting the oil breather pipework was placed on top of the crash structure.\n\nRed Bull Racing RB18 beam wing detail Photo by: Giorgio Piola\n\nRed Bull finally relented and introduced a more conventional beam wing layout for Hungary, as it looked to increase how much downforce it had at its disposal.\n\nRed Bull Racing RB18 beam wing comparison Photo by: Giorgio Piola\n\nA comparison showing the various beam wing specifications that Red Bull had employed.\n\nRed Bull Racing RB18 engine cover comparison & floor indent\n\nThe bodywork between the sidepods and engine cover was amended for the Belgian Grand Prix, with a bulge added to help optimise the airflow\u2019s passage. The lower suspension fairing was also adjusted to better suit the team\u2019s requirements, with the indent in the floor (blue arrow) already in place to help matters.\n\nRed Bull Racing RB18 rear wing comparison Photo by: Giorgio Piola\n\nAt the Italian Grand Prix, the team experimented during FP1 with a cutout in the rear wing to help reduce drag. It returned to its usual configuration for the rest of the weekend though, as it didn\u2019t offer the balance required.\n\nRed Bull Racing RB18 diffuser detail, Singapore GP Photo by: Giorgio Piola\n\nThe high downforce beam wing layout made another appearance at the Singapore Grand Prix, as the team once again sought to increase downforce.\n\nRed Bull Racing RB18 rear cooling outlet comparison\n\nThe challenges posed by the altitude and temperatures in Mexico led to the team increasing the size of the engine cover\u2019s rear cooling outlet.",

He has enormous talent and such a brilliant character; I know the whole factory is excited to be welcoming him home.\n\n\u201cIn his role as test and third driver, Daniel will give us the chance to diversify, assisting in the development of the car, aiding the Team with his experience and knowledge of what it takes to succeed in F1.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very pleased to be working with Daniel again and look forward to everything he will bring to the Team in 2023.\u201d\n\nA move to Red Bull for Ricciardo marks a reunion with the team whose young driver programme he represented through the junior ranks.\n\nAfter half a season with the backmarker HRT squad in 2011, Ricciardo linked up with Toro Rosso, Red Bull\u2019s F1 B-team, for 2012 before getting the nod to replace Mark Webber as the senior squad from 2014.\n\nRicciardo defeated reigning world champion teammate Sebastian Vettel in their only season together at Red Bull, scoring wins in Canada, Hungary and Belgium. Vettel left at the end of the 2014 to be replaced by Daniil Kvyat, who lasted until four races into the 2016 campaign before being replaced by Max Verstappen.\n\nFurther wins with Red Bull followed for Ricciardo in Malaysia in 2016 and Azerbaijan in 2017 before signing off from the team with victories in China and Monaco in 2018.\n\nHe then jumped ship to Renault, later revealing it felt like Red Bull had gravitated towards being Verstappen\u2019s team. A two-year stint followed with the French manufacturer before he joined McLaren, enduring a tricky couple of seasons with the exception of his win at Monza last year.",

However, there are often many more options in the suite of wings available than just one type for each level of downforce.</p>\n<p>For many teams, the resource restrictions and cost cap have resulted in a reduction in the number of bespoke wing solutions when compared with the previous regulatory era.</p>\n<p>And, with a low downforce, high-speed venue like Saudi Arabia slotted into second place in the calendar, many teams didn't have a more bespoke option in their suite available just yet.</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><img

by: Uncredited</p>\n<p>Red Bull did though (see above), with the new wing following the same general layout as the version used in Bahrain.</p>\n<p>However, it had adaptations to the mainplane, upper flap and endplate transitions in order to lower downforce and drag, while also shifting the DRS delta compared with the wing used in Bahrain.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Red Bull only ran one beam wing element, which not only has direct implications on the downforce and drag being generated but also results in changes to the behaviour of the diffuser and rear wing, given they all 'talk' to one another, aerodynamically speaking.</p>\n<p>This relationship also has a bearing on how the car performs when DRS is enabled and disabled, meaning it's always a trade-off between how the car will perform in traffic and whilst running in free air.</p>\n<p><strong>Trimmed flaps</strong></p>\n<img src=\"//cdn-7.motorsport.com/images/mgl/Y99d3qAY/s8/mercedes-w14-rear-wing-specs-1.jpg\"

perfectly suited to the high-speed demands of Saudi Arabia, its main rivals were all using modified versions of what they had run in Bahrain.</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>The main area of change at Hamilton's <a href=\"https://www.motorsport.com/team/mercedes/5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mercedes</a> team, for example, was a trimmed upper flap.</p>\n<p>While this would have provided a straight-line speed boost when DRS was disabled, owing to it producing less downforce and drag, it was unlikely to have offered any additional performance when DRS was open compared with the standard flap.</p>\n<p>Having tested the trimmed flap during free practice, Mercedes actually opted to run its higher downforce option and instead focused its attention on changes to its endplate cut-out.</p>\n<p>This follows the approach it had at several races during 2022 when it opted for no cut-out in the upper corner and is something it is able to change quickly given its wing's modularity.</p>\n<img src=\"//cdn-4.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YKEZe8k0/s8/mercedes-w13-rear-wing-compari-1.jpg\" alt=\"Mercedes W13 rear wing comparison\">\n<p class=\"title\">Mercedes W13 rear wing comparison</p>\n<p class=\"photographer\">Photo by: <a href=\"https://www.giorgiopiola.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Giorgio Piola</a></p>\n<p>This area of the wing is particularly sensitive to the drag being generated, as there's a strong vortex that's created as the various pressure gradients collide.</p>\n<p>The changes made to the regulations for 2022 mitigated some of this in order to improve the ability for cars to follow one another.</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>However, it's still an aerodynamic conundrum to solve and one the teams all have varying solutions for given they now have fewer tools at their disposal.</p>\n<p>Mercedes had a new solution here that they raced in Saudi Arabia, with the trailing edge of the tip section and cut-out panel trimmed back.</p>\n<p><strong>Wing options</strong></p>\n<p>Ultimately, there doesn't appear to be a big secret hidden away with Red Bull's DRS that the other teams haven't caught on to.</p>\n<p>It was just a combination of it having a rear wing, beam wing and DRS delta more specific to the circuit, whereas the others adapted what they used in Bahrain.</p>\n<p>This is the trade-off, both in design and in terms of how you manage development over the whole year against the backdrop of the resource restrictions and cost cap.</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>Others should find more performance, relatively speaking, elsewhere throughout the course of the season as they will have wings better suited for other venues.</p>\n<p>That said, it's also clear that overall the RB19 is head and shoulders above the rest anyway and this comes down to all of its design features working perfectly together.</p>\n    \n    <p id=\"ms-piano_article-prebanner\" class=\"ms-display-contents\"></p>\n\n    \n    <p

However, there are often many more options in the suite of wings available than just one type for each level of downforce.\n\nFor many teams, the resource restrictions and cost cap have resulted in a reduction in the number of bespoke wing solutions when compared with the previous regulatory era.\n\nAnd, with a low downforce, high-speed venue like Saudi Arabia slotted into second place in the calendar, many teams didn't have a more bespoke option in their suite available just yet.\n\nRed Bull RB19 rear wing Photo by: Uncredited\n\nRed Bull did though (see above), with the new wing following the same general layout as the version used in Bahrain.\n\nHowever, it had adaptations to the mainplane, upper flap and endplate transitions in order to lower downforce and drag, while also shifting the DRS delta compared with the wing used in Bahrain.\n\nFurthermore, Red Bull only ran one beam wing element, which not only has direct implications on the downforce and drag being generated but also results in changes to the behaviour of the diffuser and rear wing, given they all 'talk' to one another, aerodynamically speaking.\n\nThis relationship also has a bearing on how the car performs when DRS is enabled and disabled, meaning it's always a trade-off between how the car will perform in traffic and whilst running in free air.\n\nTrimmed flaps\n\nWhile Red Bull's wing was perfectly suited to the high-speed demands of Saudi Arabia, its main rivals were all using modified versions of what they had run in Bahrain.\n\nThe main area of change at Hamilton's Mercedes team, for example, was a trimmed upper flap.\n\nWhile this would have provided a straight-line speed boost when DRS was disabled, owing to it producing less downforce and drag, it was unlikely to have offered any additional performance when DRS was open compared with the standard flap.\n\nHaving tested the trimmed flap during free practice, Mercedes actually opted to run its higher downforce option and instead focused its attention on changes to its endplate cut-out.\n\nThis follows the approach it had at several races during 2022 when it opted for no cut-out in the upper corner and is something it is able to change quickly given its wing's modularity.\n\nMercedes W13 rear wing comparison Photo by: Giorgio Piola\n\nThis area of the wing is particularly sensitive to the drag being generated, as there's a strong vortex that's created as the various pressure gradients collide.\n\nThe changes made to the regulations for 2022 mitigated some of this in order to improve the ability for cars to follow one another.\n\nHowever, it's still an aerodynamic conundrum to solve and one the teams all have varying solutions for given they now have fewer tools at their disposal.\n\nMercedes had a new solution here that they raced in Saudi Arabia, with the trailing edge of the tip section and cut-out panel trimmed back.\n\nWing options\n\nUltimately, there doesn't appear to be a big secret hidden away with Red Bull's DRS that the other teams haven't caught on to.\n\nIt was just a combination of it having a rear wing, beam wing and DRS delta more specific to the circuit, whereas the others adapted what they used in Bahrain.\n\nThis is the trade-off, both in design and in terms of how you manage development over the whole year against the backdrop of the resource restrictions and cost cap.\n\nOthers should find more performance, relatively speaking, elsewhere throughout the course of the season as they will have wings better suited for other venues.\n\nThat said, it's also clear that overall the RB19 is head and shoulders above the rest anyway and this comes down to all of its design features working perfectly together.",

Of course, all of this was also a bit triggered with Pierre in front of me.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So that's why I had to create a gap for that final lap, because I was getting close to him. But that's not an excuse. I can't see how much fuel is in the car. But we have all the sensors in the world to track these kinds of things.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So yeah, incredibly frustrating, because I think we had a good car.

That could have been could have been also right hand down into the wall! But we saved it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Normally, if you have enough fuel in the car, that last lap would have been faster. I didn't know that I didn't have enough fuel in the car, otherwise of course, I would have just gone for it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was alright, it would have definitely been pole.

            "text": "Verstappen made his frustration clear after a miscalculation by the team saw him need to abort his final lap in Q3 because he didn\u2019t have enough fuel to complete it and then get back to the pits with the required amount for an FIA sample still in the tank.\n\nThe team had misjudged how many laps he would be able to fit in a track that was drying and getting faster.\n\nHe was ordered to pit as he approached the final corner of the lap, and responded by repeating \u201cWhy? What the fuck?\u201d on the radio.\n\nHe had already been told ease off on his previous flying lap in order to create to gap to Pierre Gasly who was ahead.\n\nThe Dutchman ended up stranded in eighth place on the grid for Sunday\u2019s race.\n\nWhen asked by Motorsport.com about his frustration, given how rarely his team has let him down, Verstappen made it clear that any criticism can work both ways.\n\n\u201cI know, but I like the critical approach,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause when I fuck up, they can also tell me that you know, I make a mistake. And I think it should be the other way around as well.\n\n\u201cBecause that's how we keep each other heading into the right direction, because we want to be perfect, and we don't want to be good. We want to be perfect.\u201d\n\nAsked if he had told the team what he thought, he said: \u201cI think they know when they saw my face and what I said on the radio.\u201d\n\nMax Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB18, locks-up his brakes and smokes his tyres Photo by: Steve Etherington / Motorsport Images\n\nVerstappen was adamant that the pitwall should have got its sums right on the lap count.\n\n\u201cI think we got to little bit surprised that of course, we had that extra lap,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you can track that you see that coming. That's why I don't really understand how that was missed.\n\n\u201cAnd, of course in hindsight, they should have let me finish the lap before where they told me to abort already to make a gap for the last lap. Of course, all of this was also a bit triggered with Pierre in front of me.\n\n\u201cSo that's why I had to create a gap for that final lap, because I was getting close to him. But that's not an excuse. I can't see how much fuel is in the car. But we have all the sensors in the world to track these kinds of things.\n\n\u201cSo yeah, incredibly frustrating, because I think we had a good car. And I think you could see that already to Q3 that on mistakes. The car was really good. The conditions are tricky, but I like that. The car was also working quite well.\u201d\n\nVerstappen was adamant that his penultimate lap, aborted when he was told to make a gap to Gasly, would have been quick.\n\n\u201cIt was already over two seconds to my fastest one in Q3. I mean, even in the lap I did, I had a big moment in the last sector. And I was already like two seconds up, I think, before I even got to these two corners.\n\n\u201cThat was a big one. That could have been could have been also right hand down into the wall! But we saved it.\n\n\u201cNormally, if you have enough fuel in the car, that last lap would have been faster. I didn't know that I didn't have enough fuel in the car, otherwise of course, I would have just gone for it.\n\n\u201cIt was alright, it would have definitely been pole. Because like I said, my 1m51.3s or whatever I did, I had a really big slide in that last chicane before the last corner. So there was a lot in it.\u201d",

And what we're more focused on as well at the moment is building a buffer with both of the drivers.\n\nMax Verstappen, Red Bull Racing, Sergio Perez, Red Bull Racing Photo by: Red Bull Content Pool\n\n\u201cBecause when we get back to Europe, I'm sure there's going to be sizeable upgrades. And, of course, we have a reduced capacity to develop this year, so that's where our focus is - trying to build a gap.\u201d\n\nHorner made it clear that there are no team orders in the Red Bull camp and it\u2019s a straight fight between Verstappen and Perez.\n\n\u201cThere's six points between them after four races so yeah, they're both competitive drivers,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey both want to win, which is why they're employed by the team. And I think that it's down to what they do on the track. They were free to race today and, all year so far, they've been free.\u201d\n\nAsked if that would continue further into the season, Horner added: \u201cYes, until the team's interests, if you're competing against a competitor, becomes bigger than the drivers' interests.

That, he reckons, could influence his longer-term outlook. </p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">&#8220;Being around the whole atmosphere, the noise, sound, smell&#8230; that will probably do what it does,&#8221; Ricciardo pondered. &#8220;And whether I&#8217;m like, yeah, stoked and excited and wanting to get back or happy being a fan for a bit longer, we&#8217;ll see.

If I did go into something that put a lot of pressure on me I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d enjoy it \u2013 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what 2023 is asking of me.\u201d\n\nRicciardo stressed that if he does decide upon a racing return then Formula 1 is still the priority, but outlined \u201cIf I go through this year and I\u2019m like \u2018you know what, I don\u2019t want to race in F1 any more, I did my time\u2019, whatever, then maybe I\u2019ll see if there something else which interests me, but [in terms of] the pure competition I\u2019m looking forward to just having this year off.\u201d\n\nRicciardo will not attend the first pair of grands prix in Bahrain or Saudi Arabia \u201cso maybe [watching on TV] will warm up a few feelings\u201d but will be on the ground on home soil, in Australia, in early April. That, he reckons, could influence his longer-term outlook.\n\n\u201cBeing around the whole atmosphere, the noise, sound, smell\u2026 that will probably do what it does,\u201d Ricciardo pondered. \u201cAnd whether I\u2019m like, yeah, stoked and excited and wanting to get back or happy being a fan for a bit longer, we\u2019ll see. I think Melbourne will tell me quite a lot.\u201d",

            "article_html": "<div><p>Much of the focus around the RB19 has revolved around its top speed &#8211; and especially the way that its DRS delivers a straight-line advantage that rivals are nowhere near matching.&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>There are numerous theories floating around about why the team&#8217;s DRS appears to be so effective &#8211; from it simply being a consequence of impressive aero efficiency on a low-drag wing package, to it coming from the result of complex stalling of the diffuser and rear wing elements.&#160;</p>\n<p>But while&#160;Red&#160;Bull&#8217;s DRS continues to provoke intrigue, rival teams are far from obsessing over what has been done in this specific area.&#160;</p>\n<p>Instead, there is a growing acceptance that&#160;Red&#160;Bull&#8217;s DRS gains are a consequence of brilliance in other aspects of its car design rather than being the trigger for its pace-setting performance.&#160;</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.motorsport.com/team/alpine/24858/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alpine</a> technical director Matt Harman said when asked about there being anything particularly special standing out with the&#160;Red&#160;Bull&#160;DRS: &#8220;There's a lot of talk about that visually, but I think if you actually dig through the data, I'm not so sure about that.&#160;&#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think they're very quick in a straight line just generally. So,&#160;from what we see, it is not something that we are looking to try and understand in great detail.&#8221;&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p>   <img src=\"//cdn-8.motorsport.com/images/mgl/68yl8mB0/s1000/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing-1.jpg\" alt=\"Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB19\"> \n<p class=\"title\">Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB19</p>\n<p class=\"photographer\">Photo by: Zak Mauger / <a href=\"https://www.motorsportimages.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Motorsport Images</a></p>\n<p>What&#160;Red&#160;Bull&#8217;s rivals are homing in on, though, is the way that the RB19 is able to maintain its aero platform around a lap &#8211; which appears to be delivering gains in allowing the car to deliver consistent downforce for the drivers.&#160;</p>\n<p>Its anti-roll, anti-squat and anti-dive features are something that the opposition are looking to adopt themselves &#8211; once they can work out exactly how&#160;Red&#160;Bull&#160;is achieving it.&#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have some ideas,&#8221; added Harman about where he felt the&#160;Red&#160;Bull&#160;was so good.&#160;&#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;There's some things we probably have no clue on, because there's some things that we do they won't have either. But their ability to run their car the way they do is quite impressive.&#160;&#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think that's certainly an inspiration to us all. So that's where we're moving towards.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n<p>Haas&#8217;s principal aerodynamicist Juan Molina said that having a perfectly consistent platform, as&#160;Red&#160;Bull&#160;appears able to deliver, can bring the kind of advantage that teams enjoyed in the active suspension days.&#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you think about active suspension,&#160;and&#160;I'm not saying anybody has it,&#160;but if you had active suspension, then you probably win the championship, because you can get the car and you can develop it in a specific position,&#8221; he said.&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>&#8220;So that's why we think if you understand what your car is doing, or where you want to put your car,&#160;and you can put your car there, you can get performance.&#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#160;will&#160;probably see teams going in that direction&#160;and&#160;trying to understand how do we get the car as low as possible, how do we cure the bouncing,&#160;and then&#160;[perfecting]&#160;your high speed to low speed performance&#160;which&#160;is obviously important for the driver.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.motorsport.com/team/mercedes/5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mercedes</a> is to begin the first stage of its move to improve its own ride platform at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix as it brings its much talked about update.&#160;</p>\n<p>While the new sidepods and floor will offer the biggest visual difference on the W14, it is the new anti-dive characteristics of its new front suspension that could actually be more critical to improving the fortunes of <a href=\"https://www.motorsport.com/driver/lewis-hamilton/1278/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lewis Hamilton</a> and <a href=\"https://www.motorsport.com/driver/george-russell/21167/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">George Russell</a>.&#160;</p>\n<p>As team boss Toto Wolff said about the potential gains from the suspension: &#8220;I don't believe in miracles, but I think that the stability of the car and the predictability for the drivers is just subpar. &#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>&#8220;If we believe we can sort that out and help it by the front suspension&#160;redesign, then that's definitely a good avenue. And this could be more of an answer too on lap time than what the aerodynamic package brings, by simply unlocking much more driveability and pace.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</p>\n<p>If DRS alone was key to&#160;Red&#160;Bull&#8217;s success, then Haas would in theory have emerged as potentially its closest challenger &#8211; as its own performance in this area is almost a match for its Milton Keynes rival.&#160;</p>\n<p>Instead, as Haas&#8217;s Molina explains, what is important to understand about the performance of all the F1 cars on the grid is that it is the sum of multiple elements.</p>\n<p>Sure, bodywork and rear wing designs may stand out the most to the naked eye as being key to differences in performance, but the reality is that lap time is driven much more by the entire package.&#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It's not only the bodywork, but how that works with your floor and your rear wing and how you have the different parts of the car,&#8221; he said.&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>&#8220;As the regulations evolve,&#160;we are converging towards a platform of performance&#160;on&#160;low speed versus high speed, etc. So, as you go towards there,&#160;the question is, where do you find the performance?&#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That's where your platform, the link between your aerodynamics and where the car is on the ground,&#160;is important.&#160;&#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;So,&#160;if you look at&#160;Red&#160;Bull, you can see they know where that car is and where they want to put the car exactly all the time. And that's something that is becoming more important as the regulation evolves.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n<p>Asked how difficult it was to achieve the perfect mechanical platform like&#160;Red&#160;Bull, Molina said: &#8220;Yeah...difficult. Last year, our departments were still evolving, learning to talk to each other. This year we're much better.&#160;&#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can see it's not only about the aerodynamics, but how we link those departments together: what we develop in the tunnel, how it translates to what you see on track, how you set up the car. &#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>&#8220;But yes, it's not easy, otherwise everybody would be where&#160;Red&#160;Bull&#160;is.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n<p>The fact that rivals are far more interested in the&#160;Red&#160;Bull&#160;mechanical platform than its DRS, says all you need to know about why the RB19&#8217;s rear wing is not the key to its success.&#160;</p>\n<p>And that also explains why even Verstappen himself has seen nothing out of the ordinary in terms of his DRS advantage.&#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;To be honest with you.

            "text": "Much of the focus around the RB19 has revolved around its top speed \u2013 and especially the way that its DRS delivers a straight-line advantage that rivals are nowhere near matching.\n\nThere are numerous theories floating around about why the team\u2019s DRS appears to be so effective \u2013 from it simply being a consequence of impressive aero efficiency on a low-drag wing package, to it coming from the result of complex stalling of the diffuser and rear wing elements.\n\nBut while Red Bull\u2019s DRS continues to provoke intrigue, rival teams are far from obsessing over what has been done in this specific area.\n\nInstead, there is a growing acceptance that Red Bull\u2019s DRS gains are a consequence of brilliance in other aspects of its car design rather than being the trigger for its pace-setting performance.\n\nAs Alpine technical director Matt Harman said when asked about there being anything particularly special standing out with the Red Bull DRS: \u201cThere's a lot of talk about that visually, but I think if you actually dig through the data, I'm not so sure about that.\n\n\u201cI think they're very quick in a straight line just generally. So, from what we see, it is not something that we are looking to try and understand in great detail.\u201d\n\nMax Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB19 Photo by: Zak Mauger / Motorsport Images\n\nWhat Red Bull\u2019s rivals are homing in on, though, is the way that the RB19 is able to maintain its aero platform around a lap \u2013 which appears to be delivering gains in allowing the car to deliver consistent downforce for the drivers.\n\nIts anti-roll, anti-squat and anti-dive features are something that the opposition are looking to adopt themselves \u2013 once they can work out exactly how Red Bull is achieving it.\n\n\u201cWe have some ideas,\u201d added Harman about where he felt the Red Bull was so good.\n\n\u201cThere's some things we probably have no clue on, because there's some things that we do they won't have either. But their ability to run their car the way they do is quite impressive.\n\n\u201cI think that's certainly an inspiration to us all. So that's where we're moving towards.\u201d\n\nHaas\u2019s principal aerodynamicist Juan Molina said that having a perfectly consistent platform, as Red Bull appears able to deliver, can bring the kind of advantage that teams enjoyed in the active suspension days.\n\n\u201cIf you think about active suspension, and I'm not saying anybody has it, but if you had active suspension, then you probably win the championship, because you can get the car and you can develop it in a specific position,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo that's why we think if you understand what your car is doing, or where you want to put your car, and you can put your car there, you can get performance.\n\n\u201cYou will probably see teams going in that direction and trying to understand how do we get the car as low as possible, how do we cure the bouncing, and then [perfecting] your high speed to low speed performance which is obviously important for the driver.\u201d\n\nMercedes is to begin the first stage of its move to improve its own ride platform at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix as it brings its much talked about update.\n\nWhile the new sidepods and floor will offer the biggest visual difference on the W14, it is the new anti-dive characteristics of its new front suspension that could actually be more critical to improving the fortunes of Lewis Hamilton and George Russell.\n\nAs team boss Toto Wolff said about the potential gains from the suspension: \u201cI don't believe in miracles, but I think that the stability of the car and the predictability for the drivers is just subpar.\n\n\u201cIf we believe we can sort that out and help it by the front suspension redesign, then that's definitely a good avenue. And this could be more of an answer too on lap time than what the aerodynamic package brings, by simply unlocking much more driveability and pace.\u201d\n\nIf DRS alone was key to Red Bull\u2019s success, then Haas would in theory have emerged as potentially its closest challenger \u2013 as its own performance in this area is almost a match for its Milton Keynes rival.\n\nInstead, as Haas\u2019s Molina explains, what is important to understand about the performance of all the F1 cars on the grid is that it is the sum of multiple elements.\n\nSure, bodywork and rear wing designs may stand out the most to the naked eye as being key to differences in performance, but the reality is that lap time is driven much more by the entire package.\n\n\u201cIt's not only the bodywork, but how that works with your floor and your rear wing and how you have the different parts of the car,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs the regulations evolve, we are converging towards a platform of performance on low speed versus high speed, etc. So, as you go towards there, the question is, where do you find the performance?\n\n\u201cThat's where your platform, the link between your aerodynamics and where the car is on the ground, is important.\n\n\u201cSo, if you look at Red Bull, you can see they know where that car is and where they want to put the car exactly all the time. And that's something that is becoming more important as the regulation evolves.\u201d\n\nAsked how difficult it was to achieve the perfect mechanical platform like Red Bull, Molina said: \u201cYeah...difficult. Last year, our departments were still evolving, learning to talk to each other. This year we're much better.\n\n\u201cYou can see it's not only about the aerodynamics, but how we link those departments together: what we develop in the tunnel, how it translates to what you see on track, how you set up the car.\n\n\u201cBut yes, it's not easy, otherwise everybody would be where Red Bull is.\u201d\n\nThe fact that rivals are far more interested in the Red Bull mechanical platform than its DRS, says all you need to know about why the RB19\u2019s rear wing is not the key to its success.\n\nAnd that also explains why even Verstappen himself has seen nothing out of the ordinary in terms of his DRS advantage.\n\n\u201cTo be honest with you. I'm not really surprised,\u201d he said recently. \u201cI think for us, it's been pretty similar to also last year.\n\n\u201cI think our car, it's quite efficient on the straights. I see people talking about us doing magical things or tricks, but we're not.\u201d\n\nNow the race is on to work out not what Red Bull is doing, but how it is doing it.",

regulations and teams direct extra research and development is into drivers' race suits. The suits are designed to provide fire protection, temperate control and such like, but outside of using hydration systems and installing cooling pads in their suits, there's not much the drivers can do to stay cool in the cockpit.</p></p></p><p class=\"inline-paragraph\"><p><p class=\"inline-paragraph__text\">Driver visibility is another hurdle teams have to clear at times. From rain to smog or the lighting used for night races, F1 racing can become very dangerous if the driver can't properly see where they're going.

            "text": "When Max Verstappen clinched his second-consecutive Formula One Drivers' Championship, it wasn't a perfect race. Heavy rain disrupted the 2022 Japanese Grand Prix , causing it to be red-flagged after two laps and the subsequent flooding delayed any attempt to restart the race for over two hours.\n\nMax Verstappen throws up a huge wake of spray down Suzuka's main straight \u00a9 Getty Images/Red Bull Content Pool\n\nIn the end, Verstappen led the field with little contest and came away with the win, taking home the world championship title in the process. The Dutchman had carved out a 113-point lead in the standings with only 112 points left on the calendar.\n\nVerstappen is known for being particularly good on rainy race days. He attributes it to a lot of hours spent driving in wet conditions. \"Growing up in Belgium and Holland, it rains a lot, so we never like turned around when it suddenly started raining. We would just put on rain tyres and practice, and that just helps a lot. You get a lot better understanding of what you have to do when it rains,\" he said.\n\nWith 23 races on the calendar for the 2023 Formula One World Championship season spanning from March to November and five different continents, you can imagine there are a wide variety of weather conditions that teams must overcome. It's a necessity for drivers and their teams to be prepared for any type of weather that will greet them.\n\nF1 races can be sodden affairs one weekend... \u00a9 Getty Images/Red Bull Content Pool ... a sun-baked scorcher the next. This is a real technical test for teams \u00a9 Getty Images/Red Bull Content Pool\n\n01 The circuit\n\nBefore we get to the cars and the drivers, we have to talk about how the weather can affect the track itself.\n\nIn F1 history, race weekend temperatures have ranged from 5\u00b0C) to 42.5\u00b0C. The general rule of thumb is that the hotter day, the less grip there is on the track. This is because F1 tyres are already heated when put on to the cars and generate more heat as they run on the track, so when a track\u2019s surface is also really hot, it can cause the tyres to overheat and wear out much faster.\n\nExtremely high track temperatures are a risk to F1's slick tyres \u00a9 Getty Images/Red Bull Content Pool\n\nAt the other end of the scale are colder temperatures and if the track surface is too cold the tyres require more energy to get going, causing them to lose pressure much more quickly.\n\nWhen there's moisture on the track, it obviously reduces the grip and traction that F1 cars have. To account for rainfall and a wet racing surface, teams make their own modifications to the car to ensure the best result (which we'll get into later).\n\nRain can also severely affect visibility. If the rain is heavy enough, it can become really difficult for drivers to see the track, a situation made much worse by the spray that other drivers are kicking up during the race. Beyond a certain point it becomes a safety hazard that may cause races to be postponed or even called prematurely, like the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix .\n\nThe spray thrown up by an F1 car is incredibly difficult to drive through \u00a9 Getty Images/Red Bull Content Pool\n\n02 Performance\n\nSince weather can have such a massive impact on the race, drivers and their teams need to be realistically prepared for whatever Mother Nature throws at them on a given race weekend.\n\nThe overall goal for a team is to find a balance between maximizing airflow to keep the car as cool as possible and maximizing the car's power output. If a team focuses too much on increasing airflow, the car becomes less aerodynamic, but if a team focuses too much on increasing the car's energy output instead, the components could overheat and malfunction.\n\nIn dry conditions, F1 drivers use dry or 'slick' tyres. These have no tread, making them the fastest tyre available in racing. These tires can range in grade from C0 (hard) to C5 (soft). Harder tyres have less grip on the track but are more durable, while softer tyres have more grip on the track but are less durable.\n\nThese tyres are only good when the track is dry however since they don't have the grip to cut through any standing water.\n\nSpotless, shiny slicks ready to go for a dry race on Sergio Perez's car \u00a9 Getty Images/Red Bull Content Pool Intermediate tyres on Max Verstappen's car. The difference is striking \u00a9 Getty Images/Red Bull Content Pool\n\nWhen it's raining, teams run wet tyres, which are equipped with tread patterns similar to those on regular car tyres. They're specially designed to displace the maximum amount of water possible and prevent the car from hydroplaning. What wet tyres boast in traction, they lack in speed \u2013 they're the slowest type of weather-specific tires that a Formula One team carries.\n\n03 Drivers\n\nJust important as what goes on outside the car, is what goes on inside it. The location of the cockpit, where the driver sits, can reach up to 60\u00b0C.\n\nFour factors increase cockpit heat:\n\nThe engine is near the cockpit, which generates significant heat.\n\nThe brakes produce heat up to 1,000\u00b0C.\n\nThe aerodynamic design of the car actually directs heat into the cockpit.\n\nThere is a lack of airflow inside the cockpit itself.\n\nIt gets really hot in an F1 cockpit, so anything to help stay cool is used \u00a9 Getty Images/Red Bull Content Pool\n\nA major area where F1 regulations and teams direct extra research and development is into drivers' race suits. The suits are designed to provide fire protection, temperate control and such like, but outside of using hydration systems and installing cooling pads in their suits, there's not much the drivers can do to stay cool in the cockpit.\n\nDriver visibility is another hurdle teams have to clear at times. From rain to smog or the lighting used for night races, F1 racing can become very dangerous if the driver can't properly see where they're going. Helmets are fitted with visors that are water-resistant and have a special coating to ensure that rainwater doesn't soak into the helmet. The visors also protect drivers from any optical or facial damage from flying debris.\n\nIt's also important to note that the FIA sanctioning body will call a race off or put it on hold if the rain creates unsafe conditions.\n\n04 Tactics\n\nDriving strategies change dramatically based on the weather conditions.\n\nFor example, when there's standing water on the track, teams will start with wet tyres to ensure that their cars have the traction required to not slide off the track instantly. However, once a track begins to dry out slightly it really becomes a chess match between teams, who have to decide when to switch to the faster intermediate tyre (a mix between wet and dry designs and compounds).\n\nKnowing when to move from wet tyres to dry is vital in mixed weather races \u00a9 Getty Images/Red Bull Content Pool\n\nIf they make the move too soon, they could lose traction on the wet parts of the track and start to fall behind, but if they make the move too late they risk burning up their wet tyres and teams who've already made the switch could begin to separate themselves from the pack and create a gap that's impossible to recover from.",

Entertainment follows sport, and that\u2019s maybe not good from the commercial side, but it is what makes Formula 1 so special.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Matt Kew and Adam Cooper",

It went in in March, in terms of&#160;[being]&#160;signed off fully by our auditors who are obviously one of the big three. And we believe that we are comfortably within the cap.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So the FIA are following their process.&#160;We expect hopefully,&#160;and&#160;potentially this week, to hear not just us, but all of the teams, the outcome of that process.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While Red Bull does not know what the FIA will state on Wednesday, he admits that there is huge responsibility on the governing body to ensure the robustness of its investigations and responses.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These are a brand new set of regulations that are highly complicated, and that apply to companies of different structures, different formulations, and of course, regulations,&#8221; he said.</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>&#8220;There's always different interpretations to those regulations. So in the first year, it will be very interesting to see how that is applied.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We've seen clarifications, even since the submissions were made, that apply to last year. So it's always going to be a process of evolution.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It's an enormous topic for the FIA to get their arms around, particularly when you look at the scale of the teams in the pit lane, many of which belong to even bigger conglomerates and organisations.&#8221;</p>\n<img src=\"//cdn-3.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0rGRqbP2/s8/sergio-perez-red-bull-racing-r-1.jpg\" alt=\"Sergio Perez, Red Bull Racing RB18, Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB18\">\n<p class=\"title\">Sergio Perez, Red Bull Racing RB18, Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB18</p>\n<p class=\"photographer\">Photo by: Zak Mauger / <a href=\"https://www.motorsportimages.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Motorsport Images</a></p>\n<p>Pushed on whether those recent clarifications about elements that should and should not be included in the cost cap had meant Red Bull was still below under the limit, Horner replied: &#8220;It is significantly below.

We will consider all of our options. And it's totally unacceptable to make a completely unfounded allegation. And on the basis of what knowledge?&#160;Where is the source of information?</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a confidential submission between the team and the FIA.

            "text": "The Singapore Grand Prix weekend was awash with speculation that two F1 teams have broken last year\u2019s circa $145 million budget cap limit and could face sanctions from the governing body.\n\nConfirmation of what has actually happened will come this Wednesday, when the FIA plans to issue teams that were under last year\u2019s cost cap with their compliance certificates.\n\nAny squads that bust the limit, in either a minor or material way, will then find out they are likely subject to a hearing where punishments will be handed out.\n\nThe focus of the potential rules breaches centred around Aston Martin and Red Bull, although both teams have been crystal clear that they reckon they have done nothing wrong.\n\nRed Bull found itself particularly in the firing line, as wild rumours suggested it could be over by as much as $10 million \u2013 and rivals Mercedes and Ferrari called for strict action and penalties from the FIA for wrongdoing.\n\nBut despite what its main opposition was saying, Red Bull remains absolute that it stands by its original submission that was made in March \u2013 which sources have suggested was actually under the limit by several million dollars.\n\nAsked by Motorsport.com if he was nervous about the outcome of Wednesday, Red Bull team boss Christian Horner said: \u201cNo, I mean, I'm absolutely confident in our submission.\n\n\u201cIt's been through a process. It went in in March, in terms of [being] signed off fully by our auditors who are obviously one of the big three. And we believe that we are comfortably within the cap.\n\n\u201cSo the FIA are following their process. We expect hopefully, and potentially this week, to hear not just us, but all of the teams, the outcome of that process.\u201d\n\nWhile Red Bull does not know what the FIA will state on Wednesday, he admits that there is huge responsibility on the governing body to ensure the robustness of its investigations and responses.\n\n\u201cThese are a brand new set of regulations that are highly complicated, and that apply to companies of different structures, different formulations, and of course, regulations,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere's always different interpretations to those regulations. So in the first year, it will be very interesting to see how that is applied.\n\n\u201cWe've seen clarifications, even since the submissions were made, that apply to last year. So it's always going to be a process of evolution.\n\n\u201cIt's an enormous topic for the FIA to get their arms around, particularly when you look at the scale of the teams in the pit lane, many of which belong to even bigger conglomerates and organisations.\u201d\n\nSergio Perez, Red Bull Racing RB18, Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB18 Photo by: Zak Mauger / Motorsport Images\n\nPushed on whether those recent clarifications about elements that should and should not be included in the cost cap had meant Red Bull was still below under the limit, Horner replied: \u201cIt is significantly below. With the clarifications, we should be even further below....\u201d\n\nHorner was upset at the reference other teams made about Red Bull over the weekend, even going as far as suggesting that their comments were \"defamatory\".\n\nHe was clear that if certain remarks were not withdrawn then Red Bull would consider legal action \u2013 a stance that remains unchanged despite there being no response so far from other parties.\n\nHorner added: \u201cWhat I said absolutely stands. We will consider all of our options. And it's totally unacceptable to make a completely unfounded allegation. And on the basis of what knowledge? Where is the source of information?\n\n\u201cThis is a confidential submission between the team and the FIA. I have no idea of the compliance of any of our rivals. So where does that information supposedly come from?\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cBut let's complete the process. We have not been informed that we are in breach of the regulations. So let's get to the end of the process and understand where we are.\u201d",

That process is ongoing with the FIA, who haven't obviously completed their process at this point in time. I think they made that clear in a statement they put out yesterday evening.\n\n\u201cSo we await with interest to see the final outcome of that process, which hopefully is in the near future, we but remain absolutely confident that we've absolutely complied with the cap.\u201d",
