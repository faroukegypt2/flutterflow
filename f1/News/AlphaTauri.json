Still, has been open about F1 aspirations and even done some testing for McLaren. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if he made that jump, it would be terrible news for IndyCar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to F1 journalist, Joe Saward Red Bull and AlphaTauri could make some driver swaps in the near future. Red Bull&#8217;s Sergio Perez has had a shockingly poor stretch in qualifying in which he has failed to make Q3 in 5 straight race weekends, most recently ahead of the British Grand Prix at <a href=\"https://www.outkick.com/brad-pitt-whips-around-silverstone-for-new-f1-movie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Silverstone</a>. That&#8217;s completely unacceptable given how dominant their car is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, some at Red Bull have made it very clear that they&#8217;re not impressed with how <a href=\"https://www.outkick.com/alphatauri-reportedly-not-replacing-nyck-de-vries-with-daniel-ricciardo-but-could-it-be-a-good-idea/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nyck De Vries</a> has faired at Alpha Tauri.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Red Bull reserve driver would be the logical option to replace Perez, but who could they get to take over at AlphaTauri (or whatever it&#8217;s called next season?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One rumours (sic) that is interesting is that Indycar star Alex Palou currently had a contractual window that might allow him to jump out of IndyCar and into an F1 drive, before the doors slam shut and he has to stay where he is, with either current employer Ganassi or McLaren,&#8221; Saward writes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He adds that Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko likes what he sees from the Spanish driver.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, all of IndyCar should be praying that Palou stays in IndyCar.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" src=\"https://www.outkick.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1180019004.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-618955\">IndyCar can&#8217;t let  (Photo by James Black/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-indycar-isn-t-a-feeder-series-it-shouldn-t-become-one\">IndyCar Isn&#8217;t A Feeder Series; It Shouldn&#8217;t Become One</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex Palou is a bonafide star in the NTT IndyCar Series. At just 26 years old, he already has one championship under his belt and looks on pace to win a second, unless the wheels completely fall off of his 2023 campaign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After winning last weekend at Mid-Ohio, Palou has won 4 of the last 5 races. That is a level of dominance not often seen in IndyCar, a series wit a far more level playing field than Formula 1.</p><p class=\"outki-387a46c3aba9e63a77db4c0adb8e4688 outki-tw-middle-article\" id=\"outki-387a46c3aba9e63a77db4c0adb8e4688\"></p><p class=\"outki-3a820119e226b6f16510f818ab859ec0 outki-middle-content-mobile\" id=\"outki-3a820119e226b6f16510f818ab859ec0\"></p><p class=\"outki-498648e992d6b619a9a6695270cb79c4 outki-middle-content-desktop\" id=\"outki-498648e992d6b619a9a6695270cb79c4\"></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Palou is one of the series&#8217; rising stars, and they can&#8217;t afford to lose him. Not just because of what he brings to the series, but the message that would send.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Palou move to F1 &#8212; especially if it proved to be successful &#8212; would likely lead to more of the series&#8217; top talent being poached by F1 teams. Before this season, Red Bull was reportedly working to bring Andretti Autosport&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.outkick.com/colton-herta-could-be-in-f1-next-year-but-a-lot-needs-to-happen-first/\">Colton Herta</a> to AlphaTauri. A lack of super license points prevented that from happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>IndyCar wants to paint itself top-tier series like Formula 1. Not as a viable stepping stone to F1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The series will never grow if begins yielding top talent to Formula 1.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://www.outkick.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1489891870-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-618956\">Chip Ganassi Racing&#8217;s Alex Palou is on a heater this season and looks to be on track for his second IndyCar championship. (Photo by Justin Casterline/Getty Images)\n\n\n\n<h2>So What Should They Do?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is how do they prevent that from happening? That&#8217;s the multi-million dollar question, isn&#8217;t it? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many drivers &#8212; especially those from Europe like Palou &#8212; grow up wanting to race in F1.

            "text": "Videos by OutKick\n\nRed Bull Racing has some driver issues this season in both of its teams, and one rumor is that the fix for at least one team could be IndyCar championship leader Alex Palou.\n\nHe\u2019s a phenomenal driver and one of the biggest names in the series. Still, has been open about F1 aspirations and even done some testing for McLaren.\n\nHowever, if he made that jump, it would be terrible news for IndyCar.\n\nAccording to F1 journalist, Joe Saward Red Bull and AlphaTauri could make some driver swaps in the near future. Red Bull\u2019s Sergio Perez has had a shockingly poor stretch in qualifying in which he has failed to make Q3 in 5 straight race weekends, most recently ahead of the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. That\u2019s completely unacceptable given how dominant their car is.\n\nMeanwhile, some at Red Bull have made it very clear that they\u2019re not impressed with how Nyck De Vries has faired at Alpha Tauri.\n\nRed Bull reserve driver would be the logical option to replace Perez, but who could they get to take over at AlphaTauri (or whatever it\u2019s called next season?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne rumours (sic) that is interesting is that Indycar star Alex Palou currently had a contractual window that might allow him to jump out of IndyCar and into an F1 drive, before the doors slam shut and he has to stay where he is, with either current employer Ganassi or McLaren,\u201d Saward writes.\n\nHe adds that Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko likes what he sees from the Spanish driver.\n\nHowever, all of IndyCar should be praying that Palou stays in IndyCar.\n\nIndyCar can\u2019t let (Photo by James Black/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)\n\nIndyCar Isn\u2019t A Feeder Series; It Shouldn\u2019t Become One\n\nAlex Palou is a bonafide star in the NTT IndyCar Series. At just 26 years old, he already has one championship under his belt and looks on pace to win a second, unless the wheels completely fall off of his 2023 campaign.\n\nAfter winning last weekend at Mid-Ohio, Palou has won 4 of the last 5 races. That is a level of dominance not often seen in IndyCar, a series wit a far more level playing field than Formula 1.\n\nPalou is one of the series\u2019 rising stars, and they can\u2019t afford to lose him. Not just because of what he brings to the series, but the message that would send.\n\nA Palou move to F1 \u2014 especially if it proved to be successful \u2014 would likely lead to more of the series\u2019 top talent being poached by F1 teams. Before this season, Red Bull was reportedly working to bring Andretti Autosport\u2019s Colton Herta to AlphaTauri. A lack of super license points prevented that from happening.\n\nIndyCar wants to paint itself top-tier series like Formula 1. Not as a viable stepping stone to F1.\n\nThe series will never grow if begins yielding top talent to Formula 1.\n\nChip Ganassi Racing\u2019s Alex Palou is on a heater this season and looks to be on track for his second IndyCar championship. (Photo by Justin Casterline/Getty Images)\n\nSo What Should They Do?\n\nThe problem is how do they prevent that from happening? That\u2019s the multi-million dollar question, isn\u2019t it?\n\nMany drivers \u2014 especially those from Europe like Palou \u2014 grow up wanting to race in F1. If that opportunity to take one of F1\u2019s 20 seats is on the table, he\u2019s going to take it.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be extremely hard to figure out a way to convince drivers to give up what was potentially a lifelong dream and stay in IndyCar.\n\nPerhaps the answer is money. Maybe the answer is pointing out that staying at Ganassi or Arrow McLaren would allow Palou to compete for wins, while a move to AlphaTauri wouldn\u2019t.\n\nIndyCar needs to do something. Because if Palou leaves for F1, expect other top-level talent to follow him.\n\nFollow on Twitter: @Matt_Reigle",

to sixth after the Red Bull driver&#8217;s latest qualifying woes, making a series of late moves to finish ahead of Aston Martin&#8217;s Fernando Alonso, Williams&#8217; Alex Albon and the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz.</p>\n<p>Williams almost had two cars in the points on home soil, with Logan Sargeant a personal best 11th, followed by the Alfa Romeo of Valtteri Bottas, who started at the back after being excluded from qualifying, and Nico Hulkenberg, who dropped to the rear early on when he picked up front wing damage on his Haas.</p>\n<p>Lance Stroll wound up 14th after being penalised for causing a collision with Pierre Gasly, who was forced to retire thereafter, joining team mate Esteban Ocon, who pitted early on amid apparent technical trouble &#8211; and Magnussen on the sidelines.</p>\n<p>Zhou Guanyu was 15th in the other Alfa Romeo, having made three pit stops (one more than anyone else), with AlphaTauri pair Yuki Tsunoda and Nyck de Vries the final drivers to cross the line after Gasly&#8217;s aforementioned dramas.</p>\n<p>After the chequered flag, there was no hiding Verstappen&#8217;s excitement as he not only moved 99 points clear of Perez in the drivers&#8217; standings, but also gave Red Bull a record-equalling 11th successive F1 win.</p>\n\n    <h3>AS IT HAPPENED</h3>\n<p>A change to the starting grid post-qualifying saw Bottas dropped from 15th to 20th and last, having been excluded from the session after his Alfa Romeo stopped out on track in Q1 and the team failed to provide a sufficient fuel sample thereafter.</p>\n<p>As the drivers returned to Silverstone for race day, the rain seen in that grid-deciding session had cleared and been replaced by brighter skies, but the threat of further showers could not be counted out, while strong winds added to the challenge once again.</p>\n<p>A couple of minutes before the race start, the tyre blankets came off to reveal that most drivers had chosen medium tyres for their first stints, while Russell, Ocon, Tsunoda and De Vries chose softs and Hulkenberg and Bottas opted for hards.</p>\n<p>When the lights went out, Norris sent the home crowd wild as he bolted off the line and charged his way past Verstappen for the lead into Turn 1, with the Dutchman having to go defensive to keep the other McLaren of Piastri behind over the next few corners.</p>\n<p>Behind the top three runners, Leclerc held fourth from the fellow fast-starting Russell, who made the most of his soft tyres, with Sainz, Alonso, Gasly, Hamilton (having run wide and lost a place at Village) and Albon holding the final top 10 positions.</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"NORTHAMPTON, ENGLAND - JULY 09:

\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <p>Verstappen crucially stayed within a second of Norris to give him the benefit of DRS when the overtaking aid came into play on Lap 2 of 52 and, just five tours in, he reclaimed P1 by tucking in behind along the Wellington Straight and diving past into Brooklands.</p>\n<p>A few cars back, Russell and Sainz went wheel-to-wheel through Stowe, coming perilously close to contact, while the other Mercedes of Hamilton set about overhauling Alonso for P8, repeating Verstappen&#8217;s move on Norris on Lap 7.</p>\n<p>With Norris and Piastri back in the positions they started, the message from the McLaren pit wall was that the Australian rookie would hold station, as they looked to work together to keep Verstappen &#8211; who reported &#8220;weird pulling&#8221; on his car &#8211; in their sights.</p>\n<p>The first pit stop of the day went to Hulkenberg and Haas, but not for a strategic reason, with replays showing him losing a front wing endplate after the recovering Red Bull of Perez muscled his way past at The Loop for 13th position.</p>\n<p>Heading onto Lap 10, which saw Ocon pull into the pits and retire, Verstappen led Norris by little more than a second, with Piastri a similar margin back, the trio in turn putting some breathing space between themselves and the Leclerc/Russell/Sainz gaggle behind.</p>\n\n    \n            \n

Lando didn&#8217;t really put up a fight, he was very nice to me, but then he actually came back again in the DRS, so he had a lot of pace today &#8211; he did very well today.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s next</h3>\n<p>The next stop on the 2023 F1 calendar will be the Hungaroring in Budapest for the <a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/racing/2023/Hungary.html\">Hungarian Grand Prix</a> weekend, which takes place from July 21 to 23.</p>\n\n    </div>",
            "text": "Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen overcame an early attack from McLaren rival Lando Norris to triumph in an action-packed British Grand Prix, marking his first-ever victory at this event and extending his current winning run to six races. Norris jumped Verstappen for the lead at the start, with team mate Oscar Piastri almost following him through, meaning it was a Red Bull in a McLaren sandwich over the first few laps \u2013 but the reigning double world champion soon fought back. AS IT HAPPENED: Follow all the action from the 2023 British Grand Prix By Lap 5, and with DRS at his disposal, Verstappen reclaimed P1 from Norris and never looked troubled, pulling away from the home favourite as the race developed and then managing a late Safety Car period \u2013 caused by Kevin Magnussen\u2019s smoking Haas \u2013 that saw the leaders go for different tyre strategies. While the majority of the front-runners chose soft tyres under the Safety Car, Norris went for hards, meaning he had to pull off some impressive defending to remain P2 over fellow Briton Lewis Hamilton, who jumped Piastri when the race was neutralised. Piastri had held third for the majority of the 52-lap encounter, only to pit just before the aforementioned Safety Car, but fourth \u2013 a couple of seconds up on the other Mercedes of George Russell \u2013 still represented the best result of the Australian rookie\u2019s burgeoning F1 career.\n\nFORMULA 1 ARAMCO BRITISH GRAND PRIX 2023 Great Britain 2023 Race results POSITION TIME POINTS 1 Max Verstappen VER Red Bull Racing 1:25:16.938 26 2 Lando Norris NOR McLaren +3.798s 18 3 Lewis Hamilton HAM Mercedes +6.783s 15 4 Oscar Piastri PIA McLaren +7.776s 12 5 George Russell RUS Mercedes +11.206s 10\n\nSergio Perez delivered another solid recovery drive to sixth after the Red Bull driver\u2019s latest qualifying woes, making a series of late moves to finish ahead of Aston Martin\u2019s Fernando Alonso, Williams\u2019 Alex Albon and the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz.

After the chequered flag, there was no hiding Verstappen\u2019s excitement as he not only moved 99 points clear of Perez in the drivers\u2019 standings, but also gave Red Bull a record-equalling 11th successive F1 win.\n\nAS IT HAPPENED A change to the starting grid post-qualifying saw Bottas dropped from 15th to 20th and last, having been excluded from the session after his Alfa Romeo stopped out on track in Q1 and the team failed to provide a sufficient fuel sample thereafter. As the drivers returned to Silverstone for race day, the rain seen in that grid-deciding session had cleared and been replaced by brighter skies, but the threat of further showers could not be counted out, while strong winds added to the challenge once again. A couple of minutes before the race start, the tyre blankets came off to reveal that most drivers had chosen medium tyres for their first stints, while Russell, Ocon, Tsunoda and De Vries chose softs and Hulkenberg and Bottas opted for hards. When the lights went out, Norris sent the home crowd wild as he bolted off the line and charged his way past Verstappen for the lead into Turn 1, with the Dutchman having to go defensive to keep the other McLaren of Piastri behind over the next few corners. Behind the top three runners, Leclerc held fourth from the fellow fast-starting Russell, who made the most of his soft tyres, with Sainz, Alonso, Gasly, Hamilton (having run wide and lost a place at Village) and Albon holding the final top 10 positions.\n\nNorris stormed into the lead as the lights went out at Silverstone\n\nVerstappen crucially stayed within a second of Norris to give him the benefit of DRS when the overtaking aid came into play on Lap 2 of 52 and, just five tours in, he reclaimed P1 by tucking in behind along the Wellington Straight and diving past into Brooklands. A few cars back, Russell and Sainz went wheel-to-wheel through Stowe, coming perilously close to contact, while the other Mercedes of Hamilton set about overhauling Alonso for P8, repeating Verstappen\u2019s move on Norris on Lap 7. With Norris and Piastri back in the positions they started, the message from the McLaren pit wall was that the Australian rookie would hold station, as they looked to work together to keep Verstappen \u2013 who reported \u201cweird pulling\u201d on his car \u2013 in their sights. The first pit stop of the day went to Hulkenberg and Haas, but not for a strategic reason, with replays showing him losing a front wing endplate after the recovering Red Bull of Perez muscled his way past at The Loop for 13th position. Heading onto Lap 10, which saw Ocon pull into the pits and retire, Verstappen led Norris by little more than a second, with Piastri a similar margin back, the trio in turn putting some breathing space between themselves and the Leclerc/Russell/Sainz gaggle behind.\n\nThis feature is currently not available because you need to provide consent to functional cookies.

With any showers holding off for the time being, Verstappen began to stretch his legs and bring his advantage over Norris up to three seconds, with the latter getting two lap times deleted for exceeding track limits and putting him at risk of a penalty. Perez\u2019s recovery drive continued at pace as he worked his way into the points by Lap 17 via moves on Stroll and Albon, making the Mexican \u2013 just over 20 seconds adrift of team mate and leader Verstappen \u2013 the biggest improver with five spots gained overall. Leclerc was the first of the front-runners to pit on Lap 19, swapping his mediums for a set of hards. \u201cI saw a Ferrari pit, I guess we just stick to our strategy?\u201d Verstappen asked the Red Bull pit wall in response, to which his engineer agreed. \u201cI\u2019m happy, it\u2019s consistent, I can maintain this for now,\u201d said Norris when asked for an update from the McLaren camp, though lap times several tenths slower than Verstappen meant the leader was now almost five seconds clear.\n\nVerstappen soon fought back against, and cleared, Norris to reclaim the lead\n\nNorris doubled down on those comments as the race approached the halfway mark, the majority appearing to go for a one-stop strategy, leaving Leclerc to provide the action as he worked his way back into the points on his alternate strategy. Sainz was the next front-runner to pit on Lap 27, moving to hards, with Russell (going to mediums) and Perez (going to softs) stopping two tours later \u2013 the Mercedes coming back out just behind the aforementioned Leclerc after an issue at the front-right. Then came some pit stop action from the sharp end as Piastri pitted on Lap 30, moving to hards and rejoining the action in sixth position, between Gasly and Albon, as attention turned to when team mate Norris and Verstappen would blink. Russell soon made up for his sluggish stop to clear Leclerc for P8 with a fine move at Luffield before Gasly and Stroll also took the opportunity to put on fresh tyres \u2013 Verstappen and Norris biding their time up front as they extended their stints. With Verstappen, Norris, Hamilton, Alonso and Albon all still yet to stop, the Virtual Safety Car was deployed when Magnussen ground to a halt in his smoking Haas on Lap 33. However, only Albon was in a position to react immediately and pit.\n\nThis feature is currently not available because you need to provide consent to functional cookies. Please update your cookie preferences 2023 British Grand Prix: Verstappen passes Norris to take the lead on Lap 5\n\nOn Lap 34, the full Safety Car was deployed, with the rest of the leading group coming into the pits, but while Verstappen, Hamilton and Alonso took on softs, Norris went for hards \u2013 setting up an intriguing tyre offset for the final stint. Leclerc also stopped for a second time to bolt on mediums. As the order filtered through after those stops, Verstappen (softs) held P1 from Norris (hards), with Hamilton (softs) jumping Piastri (hards) for third, Russell (mediums) holding fifth and lamenting a missed opportunity over the radio, Alonso (softs) in sixth and Sainz (hards), Perez (softs), Albon (softs) and Leclerc (mediums) rounding out the top 10. \u201cWonderful, huh?\u201d Norris sarcastically commented when his engineer informed him of the tyres the cars around him were running, given that only 15 laps remained \u2013 the Safety Car still circulating \u2013 and both McLarens were on the hardest tyres. At the end of Lap 38, the Safety Car peeled into the pits and released the pack of cars into green flag conditions once more \u2013 Verstappen mastering the restart on softer rubber to hold the lead from Norris and Hamilton, who looked lively and ready to attack his fellow Brit. What followed was a thrilling, multi-lap exchange between the youngster and the seven-time world champion, Norris making his McLaren as wide as possible on several occasions as his tyres came up to temperature to keep the Mercedes behind.\n\nThe late Safety Car led to some mixed tyre strategies for the final stint\n\n\u201cThat McLaren is so quick on those hards \u2013 impressive,\u201d Russell commented from P5, behind the other chrome-liveried MCL60 of Piastri, with Alonso, Sainz, Perez, Albon and Leclerc still holding onto the final points-paying positions. Meanwhile, Gasly jumped on the radio to demand that Stroll return P11 to him after a move around the outside of Stowe. Up front, Verstappen commented that his soft tyres were \u201cnot feeling that good\u201d, but his times were still several tenths quicker than Norris, while team mate Perez sparked a demise for Sainz with a move at Club \u2013 Albon and Leclerc swiftly following him through. With the stewards taking no action over Stroll\u2019s initial, bold pass on Gasly, the pair would clash again after battling Sainz for the final point, making contact into Club and leaving the Alpine with apparent suspension damage, forcing him into retirement. This time, Stroll was given a five-second penalty for his actions. Perez\u2019s charge continued with a pass on Alonso into Stowe for P6, while Albon, Leclerc and Sainz brought back memories of previous eras as Williams \u2013 celebrating their 800th Grand Prix \u2013 went toe-to-toe with Ferrari on merit.\n\nVerstappen controlled the Safety Car restart before pulling clear again\n\nAs the final laps ticked down, Verstappen continued to stretch out his lead over Norris, eventually crossing the line just under four seconds clear to bag his eighth win of the season, with Hamilton finishing three seconds further back to make it two Brits on the podium. Piastri took a fine fourth in the other McLaren, despite the opportunity of a podium going begging, followed by Russell, Perez and Alonso, with Albon, Leclerc and Sainz scoring the final points of the day after their squabble. Sargeant almost made it a double points finish for Williams in 11th, followed by Bottas and Hulkenberg, who recovered from their respective qualifying and early-race troubles, with the penalised Stroll ending up 14th. Zhou was 15th after a third stop to swap to softs under the Safety Car, with Tsunoda and De Vries the last drivers to cross the line in 16th and 17th respectively \u2013 Gasly six laps down after his incident with Stroll and Magnussen and Ocon the two DNFs.\n\nNorris and Hamilton celebrate on the podium",

            "text": "F1 has always been a battleground of opinions, and the latest topic stirring up controversy among fans is the potential move of Daniel Ricciardo to AlphaTauri for the upcoming season.\n\nThe rumors of the Australian driver, currently serving as Red Bull's reserve driver, joining the Red Bull junior team have ignited a storm of criticism from F1 enthusiasts.\n\nIt was previously believed that Ricciardo wanted to return to the grid in the 2024 season. But talks of him moving to AlphaTauri, Red Bull's junior team, were extinguished due to his desire to drive for a top team. However, these rumors have resurfaced with both parties seemingly aligning their interests.\n\nHowever, the recent resurgence of talks between Daniel Ricciardo and AlphaTauri has left fans perplexed and disappointed. Many have expressed their discontent with the idea of Ricciardo, a veteran of the sport, joining AlphaTauri, a team renowned for nurturing young and promising talent.\n\nThe backlash from fans was twofold. It stemmed from both Ricciardo's underwhelming performance during his time with McLaren and concerns about hindering the progress of emerging drivers.\n\nMany fans believe that Daniel Ricciardo does not deserve another chance to secure a seat on the grid, citing his disappointing stint with McLaren over the course of two seasons.\n\nSome fans expressed concerns that Ricciardo's potential move to AlphaTauri could impede the progress of young drivers within the Red Bull driver development program. Talented drivers such as Liam Lawson, who has been showing excellent promise, is challenging for the second AlphaTauri seat this season.\n\nHere are some of the top Twitter reactions to the news:\n\n\"I speak for everyone when I say we want Liam!\"\n\n\ud835\udc7a\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc90 @Ds11Smith @RBR_Daily I speak for everyone when I say we want Liam! @RBR_Daily I speak for everyone when I say we want Liam!\n\nV @Fruilaa @RBR_Daily What\u2019s the point?

D&#8217;Ambrosio is expected to help mentor the drivers in Mercedes&#8217; junior academy.

So today I hope you\u2019ll join me in wishing her the very best as she takes the next steps to pursue her dreams \u2013 thank you for everything Ang.\n\nHamilton won four world titles (2017-20) during Cullen\u2019s spell as his close confidant.\n\n\u201cYou GOAT,\u201d Cullen posted. \u201cI am so excited to watch the next chapter for you. There\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nEx-F1 Racer Joins Mercedes\n\nJerome d\u2019Ambrosio is now in Mercedes\u2019 camp. Qian Jun/MB Media // Getty Images\n\nEx-Formula 1 racer Jerome d\u2019Ambrosio has joined Mercedes in a driver development role. D\u2019Ambrosio contested the 2011 season with backmarker squad Marussia\u2014which has long since collapsed\u2014and made one outing in 2012 with Lotus.\n\n\n\nD\u2019Ambrosio subsequently switched to Formula E, winning three races across a six-season stint, before retiring in 2020.\n\nHe remained in the electric single-seater series after taking on a deputy team boss role at Venturi, becoming its outright team boss for one season, before departing when it transitioned to Maserati for the 2023 campaign. D\u2019Ambrosio is expected to help mentor the drivers in Mercedes\u2019 junior academy. It was a promising start, with Mercedes junior Frederik Vesti claiming his first Formula 2 Feature Race victory on Sunday afternoon.\n\nWilliams Rules Out Honda 2026 Tie-in\n\nWilliams has effectively ruled itself out of the running to have any affiliation with Honda in 2026. The Japanese firm has applied for the new-for-2026 engine rules but is without a client, following the development that Red Bull Powertrains will align itself with Ford.\n\n\n\nWilliams has a long-standing relationship with Mercedes, stretching back to 2014, and was mooted as a possible option for Honda. But cold water has been poured on that notion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what they have facility-wise,\u201d said Williams boss James Vowles on Honda. \u201cBut I think they\u2019re a little bit further away from it than they would need to be for it to be a serious contender for that year.\u201d\n\nWilliams will pass on a possible Honda deal in 2026. Joe Portlock - Formula 1 // Getty Images\n\nVowles stopped short of suggesting that Williams will remain with Mercedes\u2014outlining that options are being assessed\u2014but a decision is expected before the end of 2023.\n\nVowles\u2019 comments came during a media breakfast, attended by Autoweek, at which he eloquently conveyed the long-term vision being installed at Williams amid a better-than-expected start to 2023.\n\nWilliams has recruited Frederic Brousseau as its new chief operating officer, who arrives after spending several decades in the aerospace industry. High on the agenda for Vowles is appointing a technical director and technical leadership structure than can be in place at Williams for several years to come.\n\nBottas to Test Supercar in Adelaide\n\nValtteri Bottas spends a swathe of his spare time in Australia, where partner professional cyclist Tiffany Cromwell hails from, and he will head out to the next round earlier than most.\n\nBottas will get behind the wheel of the 2016 Bathurst 1000-winning Holden VF Commodore V8 Supercar at the 2023 Adelaide Motorsport Festival on Sunday, and will also drive an Alfa Romeo GTV Group A touring car as part of a heritage run. Bottas\u2019 affinity also extends to Formula 1\u2019s Australian Grand Prix, an event he won in 2019.",

            "text": "Tsunoda pulled up at the side of the track on Lap 43, reporting to AlphaTauri over the radio that not all of his tyres were fitted correctly.\n\nThirty seconds later, Tsunoda was told to continue as there was no data suggesting anything was wrong. He returned to the pits to have his seatbelts retightened and a different set of tyres fitted to his car.\n\nBut soon after going back out on track, Tsunoda was told by his engineer to stop the car as the team had spotted a problem. Tsunoda parked near a gap in the fence by a marshal post, but a Virtual Safety Car was still required to recover his car safely.\n\nAlphaTauri chief engineer for vehicle performance Claudio Balestri called the issue a \u201ccar failure\u201d in the team's post-race press release, and confirmed it was being investigated.\n\n\u201cAfter the pit stop he reported something strange at the rear of the car, we called him in again to change the tyres and immediately after we had a car failure,\u201d said Balestri.\n\n\u201cThis is currently under investigation within the team.\u201d\n\nYuki Tsunoda, AlphaTauri AT03 Photo by: Erik Junius\n\nAsked by Motorsport.com about the initial stoppage, Tsunoda said he \u201cthought there was an issue\u201d that was \u201cquite clear, especially at the left-rear.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got told from engineer to stop, but we didn\u2019t see any clear issue or any issue in the data,\u201d said Tsunoda.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we rejoined back again to pit for new tyres. After that, we saw a clear issue in the data. That\u2019s why we stopped.\u201d\n\nBut Tsunoda said the problem persisted as soon as he left the pits, feeling like there was \u201conly one wheel that was having wheelspin.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was like drifting on the straight, like, I was doing counter-steering on the straight,\u201d Tsunoda said.\n\n\u201cThat is why I didn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s normal. That\u2019s why.\u201d\n\nTsunoda had been in contention to score his first points since the Spanish Grand Prix in May, having reached Q3 on Saturday ahead of teammate Pierre Gasly.\n\nTsunoda felt his performance had been \u201cpretty strong this week\u201d, but he wanted to get a clean weekend to rediscover his form.\n\n\u201cFirst I need a clean race week, I think I could have a good rhythm after that,\u201d said Tsunoda.\n\n\u201cCurrently I don\u2019t have a good rhythm at all. So I just want to be back into the good rhythm and to score points consistently.\u201d\n\nTsunoda was handed a reprimand by the stewards for loosening his seatbelts while in the cockpit after his initial stoppage, saying he was \u201cready to abandon the car and started to loosen the safety belt, without unlocking it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter that he travelled back to the pits where the mechanics re-fastened the belts,\u201d the stewards\u2019 bulletin reads.\n\n\u201cIt is not possible, to determine exactly to which degree the seatbelt had been loosened by the driver.\u201d\n\nThe stewards\u2019 document also stated it was a differential issue that caused Tsunoda to initially stop on track, something Tsunoda also claimed over the radio.\n\nAdditional reporting by Oleg Karpov",

Front suspension, bodywork and floor updates for the W14 were due to appear at Imola, with the aim of providing a more stable aerodynamic platform for the car. The biggest shortfall of the W14 so far has been rear grip through high-speed corners and Imola would have been quite a good test of how effective the upgrade was in addressing that.\n\nThis feature is currently not available because you need to provide consent to functional cookies.

Day 1 of testing saw Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen set the fastest time before Alfa Romeo\u2019s Zhou Guanyu lit up the timesheets on Day 2, and Verstappen\u2019s team mate Sergio Perez capped off the test with the fastest lap of the whole test on Day 3. Our data team have crunched the numbers and \u2013 with the usual caveats that it's hard to be definitive given unknowns like fuel loads and setups \u2013 this is how they reckon the order is looking ahead of the new season... READ MORE: The 5 key questions from 2023 pre-season testing in Bahrain\n\n10. Williams\n\nSmooth sailing for Williams rookie Logan Sargeant and his new team mate in Bahrain\n\nWilliams' only reliability concern over the three days of pre-season testing was a small electrical issue, as rookie Logan Sargeant and team mate Alex Albon notched up an impressive 439 laps of the Bahrain International Circuit, which is as good a return as they could hope for. As for the performance of the FW45, Albon said the car was \"definitely quicker\" than last year's version. Whether we saw the true potential of it last week remains to be seen, and right now they sit at the bottom of the Power Rankings. That doesn't mean they haven't improved; it means there might be more to come from the sleeping giants. WINNERS AND LOSERS: Who aced 2023 F1 pre-season testing and who has work to do ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix? 9. Haas\n\nHaas notched 414 laps over the three days, with the team's fastest tour set by Kevin Magnussen\n\nHaas got some solid running on the board as Kevin Magnussen set the seventh-fastest time of testing on Day 3 and Nico Hulkenberg got his eye in once again. Test driver Pietro Fittipaldi said the team were around P5-P7 in the charts but our data might hint that, at this stage before the opening Grand Prix, they're perhaps not at the level of Alpine and Aston Martin \u2013 but this midfield is so competitive that a small swing in their favour could go a long way. Furthermore, Haas seem to enjoy Bahrain \u2013 it's where Magnussen pulled off his \"Viking comeback\" in 2022... BARRETTO: Testing has given us a fascinating insight into the pecking order for 2023 \u2013 but the full story is going to be even juicier 8. AlphaTauri\n\nAlphaTauri finished ninth in last year's standings \u2013 can they move up the order this season?\n\nAlphaTauri led the mileage stakes in Bahrain with 456 laps of the circuit that will also host this weekend's season-opener. Yuki Tsunoda and rookie team mate Nyck de Vries clearly encountered no bugs with their AT04, but the team's pace was hard to read as Tsunoda managed a fast flying lap only at the end of the third day \u2013 which might have been a low-fuel quali run. So we haven't had a proper read on the Faenza team's pace, but our preliminary data hints that they're only just above Haas and Williams in the stakes. Again, the same caveats as above apply in this tight midfield scrap. ANALYSIS: How do McLaren, Haas, AlphaTauri and more stack up after pre-season testing in Bahrain? 7. McLaren\n\nNot the ideal start for McLaren, who pushed for P4 in the standings last season\n\nMcLaren were one of the surprises from pre-season testing, and not for the reasons they would have liked. The team in orange seemed to struggle with aerodynamic efficiency and further issues sprung up at the front of the car with their front wheel brows needing strengthening, which hampered rookie Oscar Piastri and team mate Lando Norris. As a result, McLaren managed just 312 laps over the three days and our data put them in the bottom half. Perhaps they didn't get a representative quali or race run in, but it's not a great start for the Woking team. READ MORE: More points and prizes, mini leagues and boosters \u2013 How to get the most out of F1 Fantasy in 2023 6. Alfa Romeo\n\nA brace of red flag-triggering issues aside, Alfa Romeo have cause to smile\n\nAlfa Romeo's Zhou Guanyu topped the timesheets on Day 2 with a run on C5 tyres and it would really be something if they do that again in qualifying this Saturday. It's fair to assume that this was not a lap worth reading too much into and our data backs that up, putting Alfa Romeo in the midfield battle. But there are reasons to be optimstic for Alfa Romeo and fans of Valtteri Bottas and Zhou, because it does look like they've made some improvements over last year. Two significant reliability issues during the three days of testing might be reason for concern, however. WATCH: Jolyon Palmer\u2019s testing takeaways after three busy days in Bahrain 5. Alpine\n\nMore to come from last year's midfield-toppers Alpine?\n\nAlpine were bullish during launch season with their engineers showing off numerous aero changes and talking of a significant decrease in weight, but the team didn't seem to show their hand in testing: there were no blistering glory runs and their long runs were hard to read. New signing Pierre Gasly hinted that there was pace in the A523 but that race simulation on the final day was interrupted by a red flag. So our data put the team that finished fourth in last year's constructors' standings one step lower in this year's pre-season Power Rankings. VOTE: Which of the 10 teams impressed you most in 2023 pre-season testing? 4. Aston Martin\n\nAston Martin turned heads in Bahrain testing\n\nAston Martin's AMR23 looks like a big step up from last year's car, which saw the team finish seventh in the standings. Our data puts them fourth in the rankings before the opening Grand Prix \u2013 is that an outlandish or realistic expectation for Lance Stroll and Fernando Alonso? Well, Haas driver Magnussen and Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner have already pointed at Aston Martin as this year's most-improved in testing. It would be far-fetched to expect a Red Bull-beating display from Aston Martin but long runs and short runs were both favourable over the three days. Fernando Alonso was particularly fast and reserve driver Felipe Drugovich was no slouch as he replaced the injured Stroll in testing.

Jack Doohan has been named as the team's reserve driver for 2023, a role he will dovetail with a Formula 2 campaign.\n\nAlphaTauri\n\nDue to its close ties with Red Bull, AlphaTauri doesn't have a reserve driver of its own. The small team from Faenza can call on the big brother's pool instead. Promising youngsters from the Red Bull training programme are also given the opportunity to gain mileage at AlphaTauri.\n\nAlex Albon, Williams FW45 Photo by: Williams F1\n\nThe legendary Grove-based team had Logan Sargeant as a test driver in 2022. However, the young American will be promoted to the second race seat alongside Alexander Albon for 2023. Williams does not employ its own reserve driver. In recent years, they've been able to call on the reserves of engine partner Mercedes when necessary. Whether that will also be the case in 2023 is not yet known.\n\nHaas\n\nReserve driver: Pietro Fittipaldi\n\nPietro Fittipaldi has filled the role of reserve driver at Haas for the past three seasons. At the Brazilian Grand Prix, team boss Gunther Steiner revealed that a continuation of the partnership would be possible if it fits within Fittipaldi's racing plans, which has since been confirmed.",

After the last two seasons featured three sprint races, F1 has increased that number to six for 2023.</p><p>Sprint weekends offer more competitive on-track action, with qualifying held on Friday setting a grid for a shortened race on Saturday that sets the grid for Sunday's grand prix.</p><p>The venues for the sprint races this year are Azerbaijan, Austria, Belgium, Qatar, United States and Brazil.</p><h2>What else is new?</h2><p>There have been a number of driver switches over the winter as well as some high-profile management changes.</p><p><b>Alonso to Aston Martin</b></p><p>After making his return to F1 with Alpine two seasons ago, two-time champion Fernando Alonso decided to switch things up for 2023 and move to Aston Martin. The news, which was announced the day after last year's Hungarian Grand Prix, caught Alpine by surprise and set in motion a number of other changes up and down the grid. Alonso joins Aston Martin ahead of the team's move to its new factory in May, which it hopes will help close the gap the to the front of the grid.</p><p><b>Ricciardo becomes Red Bull's third driver</b></p><p>Once all of the drama of F1's driver market had played out, Daniel Ricciardo was the biggest name without a seat on the grid for 2023. After starting the 2022 season in the second year of a seemingly air-tight three-year contract with McLaren, poor results and the emergence of Oscar Piastri as a potential replacement saw him agree to an early termination of the deal at the end of the year. Options elsewhere were slim and he opted not to explore the possibility of a move to Haas, instead returning to his old team Red Bull where he will take on marketing and test driver responsibilities. He hopes to return to the grid in 2024, although it is not yet clear where he will slot in.</p><p><b>Oscar Piastri joins McLaren</b></p><p>Piastri has long been recognised as the most exciting young driver outside F1, and it was always a matter of time until he joined the grid. As an Alpine junior the main blockage in his career progression had been the team's two race drivers, Alonso and Esteban Ocon, who appeared to be committed to Alpine until Alonso announced his plans to move to Aston Martin in the summer. By that time, however, Piastri and his manager Mark Webber were already fed up of waiting on a more permanent deal and had signed with McLaren for Piastri to replace Ricciardo. Expectations are set high after such a turbulent entry into F1, but Piastri's record suggests he has the talent to meet and exceed them.</p><p><b>An American on the grid</b></p><p>F1's seven-year wait for an American driver is finally over with Logan Sargeant joining Williams this year. Initially it looked like Colton Herta would be America's breakthrough star but his performance in IndyCar meant he wasn't eligible for a superlicence, which blocked a move to AlphaTauri. Meanwhile, Sargeant, who finished fourth in Formula 2 last year, was impressing Williams in his development driver role and was announced as Nicholas Latifi's replacement and Alex Albon's teammate for 2023.</p><p><b>Gasly to Alpine and de Vries to AlphaTauri</b></p><p>Pierre Gasly emerged as Alpine's top pick to replace Alonso once it lost Piastri to McLaren, but the Frenchman had a contract to race for AlphaTauri in 2023. However, a well-timed super-sub performance by Dutchman Nyck de Vries at Williams -- standing in for Albon in Italy when the Thai driver had appendicitis -- convinced AlphaTauri to release Gasly and sign up the former Formula E champion. The switch sees Gasly join Esteban Ocon in an all-French lineup at Alpine and de Vries partner Yuki Tsunoda at AlphaTauri.</p><p><strong>The return of the The Hulk</strong></p><p>Haas' patience with Mick Schumacher finally ran out in 2022 as it decided to replace him with the more experienced Nico Hulkenberg. The 35-year-old German raced five times across the 2020 and 2022 seasons as a reserve driver for Racing Point/Aston Martin but has not completed a full season since 2019. Haas hopes the combination of Hulkenberg and Kevin Magnussen will bring consistent results and limit its repair bill, which spiraled in 2022 after Schumacher had two big accidents in Saudi Arabia and Monaco. The son of seven-time world champion Michael will remain in F1 as Mercedes' reserve driver.</p><p><b>Binotto out at Ferrari, Vasseur in</b></p><p class=\"ad-slot ad-slot-incontent2 ad-wrapper\"></p><p>It wasn't just drivers switching teams, a number of key management personnel have also left or moved roles over the winter. The trigger was Mattia Binotto resigning from the top spot at Ferrari after a long-awaited title campaign failed to materialise in 2022. Binotto had denied stories he would leave the team right up to until the final round of the year, but just weeks after the chequered flag fell in Abu Dhabi he was out of the job. Alfa Romeo's Fred Vasseur was lined up to take Binotto's place and had his first day in charge at the start of the second week of January.</p><p>McLaren team principal Andreas Seidl was released from his role shortly after to head up Audi's entry to F1 in 2026, which will see the German brand take over the Sauber team currently running under the Alfa Romeo name. Seidl will be replaced by Andrea Stella at McLaren, who was previously the team's sporting director and is highly-rated by CEO Zak Brown.</p><p>Elsewhere, Jost Capito left Williams along with the team's technical director FX Demaison. No replacement has been announced for either.</p><h3>Rules</h3><p>After the complete overhaul of Formula One's technical regulations for 2022, the changes this season are relatively minor. Tweaks have been made to the regulations around the floor of the cars -- raising the throat of the diffuser in height and introducing more stringent flexibility tests -- to reduce their sensitivity and decrease the propensity for the 'porpoising' seen at the start of last year. The FIA will also continue to monitor the car's oscillations on track and disqualify any car that is bouncing at a rate deemed dangerous to the driver.</p>\n</div>",

            "text": "F1' all-new era kicked off in 2022, with overhauled technical regulations that led to closer racing, more overtaking and plenty of drama. But which drivers hit the ground running when the new cars hit the track? It\u2019s time for an all-in-one comparison of this year\u2019s team mates... First, some ground rules for our scoring: Final grid slots have been used to determine the qualifying battle outcome\n\nFinal grid positions are counted for \u2018Highest Grid Position\u2019, not the initial order from qualifying\n\nMechanical failures and/or collisions that are registered as classified finishes have been counted as DNFs here Red Bull\n\nMax Verstappen was credited by Red Bull chiefs for stepping it up another gear as he charged to a second world championship, having taken an incredible 15 wins and 17 podium finishes from the 22 races staged across the globe in 2022. When compared to team mate Sergio Perez, that meant 13 more victories and six more podiums for the most dominant intra-team race day head-to-head of the season \u2013 only heightened by the margin of 149 points between them. It was a similar story in qualifying (18 to four for Verstappen). WATCH: The anatomy of Max Verstappen \u2013 What does it take to become an F1 champion? While Perez consistently racked up solid points, Verstappen\u2019s relentless winning ways (after two costly DNFs early in the season) did the damage, with the Dutchman finishing no more than two races in a row off the top step and triumphing in nine of the last 11 Grands Prix. Ferrari\n\nCharles Leclerc was the king of qualifying in 2022 as he bagged nine pole positions at the wheel of Ferrari\u2019s undeniably fast F1-75, two clear of double champion Verstappen and six ahead of team mate Carlos Sainz. Unfortunately for the Scuderia, this underlying pace often went missing on race day through strategic blunders, reliability issues and driver mistakes \u2013 Sainz suffering a record-equalling six retirements, and two from the first four races.

However, with 62 more points, Leclerc secured a career-best P2 in the drivers\u2019 standings, while Sainz had to settle for P5. Mercedes\n\nOf the top three teams in the constructors\u2019 standings, the intra-team battle at Mercedes was the closest of them all, with little to separate seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton and new arrival George Russell. In qualifying, and after some early-season experiments, Hamilton found the edge to end the campaign with a record of 13 to nine, while Russell took race days 12 to 10.

Alpine\n\nAnother tight team mate scrap \u2013 and one that boiled over towards the end of the season with a pair of dramatic clashes during the F1 Sprint in Sao Paulo \u2013 involved Alpine pair Fernando Alonso and Esteban Ocon.

McLaren\n\nLando Norris delivered the most dominant intra-team qualifying head-to-head record in 2022 with a score of 20 to two over Daniel Ricciardo, who leaves McLaren this winter to take up a reserve role at former team Red Bull. Whether it was a case of Norris excelling, Ricciardo struggling or a bit of both, the young Briton also stamped his authority on race days, finishing ahead 16 to five and scoring 85 more points.

Alfa Romeo\n\nAlfa Romeo were one of the surprise packages at the start of F1\u2019s rules reset as their trim C42 hit the ground running; Zhou Guanyu scoring on his Grand Prix debut and Valtteri Bottas taking points from seven of the first nine races.

            "title": "What went right and what went wrong for every F1 team in 2022",
            "article_html": "<div><p>The 2022 Formula One season is over. Red Bull took the championship, but all 10 teams had at least one good thing to shout about, as well as moments that didn't go to plan, across the season.</p><p>Here we look at the best and worst of every team's season, in championship order.</p><h2>1. Red Bull</h2><img class=\" lazyload lazyload\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\">Mario Renzi - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images<p><b>What went right:</b> Pretty much everything. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&amp;driverId=4665\">Max Verstappen</a> was on another level this year and looked as good as any dominant champion in F1's recent history, winning a record 15 of the team's 17 victories. Verstappen's ability to continually raise the bar was impressive and it is hard to argue against him being the best driver in F1 right now. With Verstappen on board the team's future looks incredibly bright. The team operated at a top level too. Red Bull out-developed and out-strategised its rivals throughout the year and continually underlined the strength of the whole F1 operation -- head of strategy Hannah Schmitz was one of the heroes of the team's campaign. The world champions had to deal with engine supplier Honda officially withdrawing from F1, but later struck a deal to continue using one of the best power units in F1 until the end of 2025. Early reliability issues threatened the team's championship challenge in the early weeks of the year but once the team was on top of those problems, it never looked back.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> Optics and reputational damage. The team's 2021 budget cap overspend cast a shadow over the achievement of winning both F1 titles for the first time since 2013. Red Bull was hit with a $7 million fine and will lose 10 percent of its aerodynamic testing allowance next year. Red Bull was already due to have the lowest allocation of any team, having won the championship, raising the possibility it could struggle to keep pace with the development of Ferrari and Mercedes next year. Then there was Brazil, where Verstappen refused a simple request to help his dutiful teammate <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&amp;driverId=4472\">Sergio Perez</a> in his bid to finish second in the drivers' championship. It made Verstappen look petulant and disrespectful and, worst of all, made the team look powerless to control their superstar driver. Red Bull took the blame, but the damage was done. Team harmony is now a big question-mark and the whole saga may set up an interesting situation if Verstappen needs Perez's help in a tighter championship fight next season.</p><h2>2. Ferrari</h2><img class=\" lazyload lazyload\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\">Peter J Fox/Getty Images<p><b>What went right:</b> Returning to the front. Ferrari's car was the cream of the crop in winter testing and started with two <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&amp;driverId=5498\">Charles Leclerc</a> wins from three races early on. The team had clearly made good decisions in the preceding year in terms of car design, after two years woefully off the pace following its private settlement with the FIA for running an illegal engine in 2019. Building a more competitive car than the all-conquering Mercedes outfit was a feather in the cap and it did manage to secure second in the championship. Although the season did not end with the championship win many had hoped, Ferrari has set a good baseline for future seasons and is not as far from contention as in previous years.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> Strategy, car reliability, driver errors -- the list is long. Not long after those two early wins, Ferrari's season imploded. The team made many baffling strategy calls and its radio communications with drivers became a source of comedy at the end of the season, with Leclerc especially sounding fed up with things at recent events. Team boss Mattia Binotto infamously declared there was no reason the team couldn't win the final 10 races of the season, only for the team not to win any of them. Binotto's job appears to be hanging by a thread now and it is clear big changes are needed if Ferrari wants to be a champion any time soon. The team cannot shoulder all the blame, though. Leclerc and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&amp;driverId=4686\">Carlos Sainz</a> made their fair share of mistakes at big moments which only worsened the team's woes through the year.</p><h2>3. Mercedes</h2><img class=\" lazyload lazyload\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\">Peter J Fox/Getty Images<p><b>What went right:</b> The team's driver pairing and emergence of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&amp;driverId=5503\">George Russell</a>. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&amp;driverId=4520\">Valtteri Bottas</a>' performances were a weak point of the team in previous years but with Russell at the helm alongside <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&amp;driverId=868\">Lewis Hamilton</a>, the team has two superstar drivers. Mercedes quite comfortably has the best driver lineup on the grid right now. Russell lived up to all expectations and beat Hamilton's points haul over a season -- only the third teammate to do that in 16 years. He scored a memorable first win in Brazil, the team's only victory. Hamilton started slowly but was back to his best by midseason and it is clear the fire is burning within him as much as ever. If Mercedes can build a title-worthy car and avoid internal conflict, it will be a formidable pairing for any team to beat.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> The car. Mercedes' championship challenge seemed over before the season had even started. The W13 featured a radical concept, different to any other car on the grid, and it immediately created problems for the team. The car was known for how it bounced at high speeds earlier in the year -- a phenomenon known as porpoising. It meant Mercedes started on the back foot, which was a fall from grace after eight seasons at the front of the pack. The team managed to solve early problems and developed well over the year, but it was never a legitimate contender for the title. Toto Wolff has vowed to put the troublesome car in the reception of the team's two factories next season to remind employees how difficult it is to win in Formula One.</p><h2>4. Alpine</h2><img class=\" lazyload lazyload\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\">Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images<p><b>What went right:</b> Beating McLaren to fourth. Realistically, this was the best the French team could hope for this year, with F1's top three clearly a step ahead of the rest. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&amp;driverId=4678\">Esteban Ocon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&amp;driverId=348\">Fernando Alonso</a> were two of 2022's in-form drivers and there were only three races Alpine failed to score a point at. With a lot of questions about the long-term vision of the Renault factory outfit, this result was a sign that, whatever might be going wrong behind the scenes, the team is at least on a good path in terms of its car.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> Team management and reliability. It was a bad look for the French team to lose Alonso and Oscar Piastri to rival teams in the space of a week. The handling of mega-talented junior driver Piastri, for so long considered the future of the team, was farcical, while Alonso was happy to take a step down the grid to Aston Martin after Alpine dithered on his contract extension. It seems the in-fighting and mismanagement which has plagued the Renault operation since it returned to F1 in 2016 has not gone away. Although it finished fourth, Alonso regularly called out the team's spotty reliability record and it will need to get on top of this if it wants to continue an upward trajectory without the Spaniard at the helm.</p><h2>5. McLaren</h2><img class=\" lazyload lazyload\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\">ANP via Getty Images<p><b>What went right:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&amp;driverId=5579\">Lando Norris</a>. McLaren extended Norris' F1 contract until 2025 at the start of the season. It will be money well spent. By finishing 'best of the rest', a term Norris said he does not actually like, the British driver was one of the year's standout performers and the only driver outside of the top three teams to score a podium, which he did at Imola. Norris is one of the best long-term prospects in F1 right now. He did not win a race but, unlike his missed opportunity in Sochi last year, McLaren was never in the mix for victory. When Norris gets a competitive car there can be little doubt he will be a contender for victories and championships in future.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&amp;driverId=4510\">Daniel Ricciardo</a> and a car stranded in the midfield. While Norris excelled in one car, Ricciardo floundered in the other, scoring a staggering 82 fewer points than his teammate. CEO Zak Brown cut the Australian's deal short one year early, a decision understandable in the context of Ricciardo's results since joining McLaren in 2021. Ricciardo wasn't the only concern. McLaren came into the season hoping to make the top three a pack of four teams, but it seemed further away from the front this year and never came close to challenging for a win. There has been progress under Brown but this famous F1 team might be stuck in the midfield for a little while yet. The longer that wait goes on, the harder it will be to convince Norris to stay.</p><h2>6. Alfa Romeo</h2><img class=\" lazyload lazyload\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\">Lars Baron/Getty Images<p><b>What went right:</b> Audi, Valtteri Bottas and finishing sixth. Bottas was a superb signing by the Swiss team and the Finn was at the center of the Hinwil operation's best championship result since finishing sixth as Sauber in 2012. Bottas scored 49 of the teams 55 points, showing how valuable that kind of experience can be to a midfield team with a competitive car. Rookie driver <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/racing/driver/_/id/5682/guanyu-zhou\">Zhou Guanyu</a> is unpolished but may have the talent to stay in F1 for a while if he can show progress next year. On top of everything else, Alfa Romeo secured a huge partnership with German manufacturing giants Audi for 2026, which will be a huge boost for the future of a team that has won just one race in its 26 years on the F1 grid. Good times await.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> Reliability. Despite the strong result, Alfa had one of the worst reliability records on the grid. During the European rounds Alfa's cars seemed to hit an issue every weekend and that surely left a huge haul of points on the table across the season. Over the final 12 races the team added just four points to its tally and ended up tied on 55 with Aston Martin. Bottas' fifth-place finish at Imola -- which neither Aston driver could match -- won a tiebreaker, but it shows you how costly those issues might have been. The two cars' starts were also terrible all year, something the drivers put down to clutch issues.</p><h2>7. Aston Martin</h2><img class=\" lazyload lazyload\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\">Dan Istitene - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images<p><b>What went right:</b> Convincing Alonso to join the project. Alonso is exactly the kind of driver Aston Martin needs to achieve Lawrence Stroll's lofty ambitions of running at the front of the grid in a few years. Stroll has shown he is willing to spend big to achieve his goals and this was an indication of how serious he is. Alonso, who joins on a three-year deal, has no issues publicly calling out a team for poor performances or reliability and he might be the driving force the team needs internally to move up the order. He remains one of F1's most talented drivers and, as long as Aston Martin can manage his ego the right way, Alonso will be a huge boost to the team going forward. It is clear he is as fired up as ever, which is always as good thing.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> A lack of competitiveness. Aston Martin's car is still a long way from looking like one that can challenge for anything meaningful in F1. Stroll has invested heavily in a new factory opposite the Silverstone circuit but it is only just coming online and was completed too late to have an impact on the 2022 campaign. The most worrying thing this year will be how far behind the Alpine/McLaren battle Aston Martin found itself, with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&amp;driverId=864\">Sebastian Vettel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&amp;driverId=4775\">Lance Stroll</a> often fighting at the lower end of the order in qualifying and races. Aston Martin is a long way away from proving it is a team moving in the right direction.</p><h2>8. Haas</h2><img class=\" lazyload lazyload\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\">Peter J Fox/Getty Images<p><b>What went right:</b> The return of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&amp;driverId=4623\">Kevin Magnussen</a> and a new title sponsor. The team's future seemed uncertain when it cut ties with Uralkali at the start of the year, but it bounced back superbly. K-Mag's return was a great sporting comeback story and showed why the team is now going for the experienced <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/racing/driver/_/id/4396/nico-hulkenberg\">Nico Hulkenberg</a> over the error-prone <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&amp;driverId=5654\">Mick Schumacher</a> -- experience is key. Magnussen scored the bulk of Haas' points at the start of the season and that proved vital in finishing ahead of AlphaTauri for eighth in the championship. Ahead of the U.S. Grand Prix, Haas confirmed the arrival of MoneyGram as title sponsor, which team boss Guenther Steiner said will allow the team to spend at the top end of the cost cap. The team will hopefully be able to turn its attentions to a return to the midfield pack in future years.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> Money and Mick. In the period between Uralkali and MoneyGram, it was clear how strapped for cash Haas was this year. The team had to delay a planned upgrade midway through the year and it slipped down the order as other teams developed their cars. Haas' cause was not helped by Schumacher's expensive crashes in the opening races, which left them worried about running out of spare parts at some races. Schumacher showed glimpses of form after that but ultimately not enough to keep his job. Although MoneyGram is a boost, Haas lost ground to several midfield rivals in the spell without a title partner in a crucial year in this new generation of cars - the first year sets the baseline for what is to come.</p><h2>9.

            "text": "The 2022 Formula One season is over. Red Bull took the championship, but all 10 teams had at least one good thing to shout about, as well as moments that didn't go to plan, across the season.\n\nHere we look at the best and worst of every team's season, in championship order.\n\n1. Red Bull\n\nMario Renzi - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images\n\nWhat went right: Pretty much everything. Max Verstappen was on another level this year and looked as good as any dominant champion in F1's recent history, winning a record 15 of the team's 17 victories. Verstappen's ability to continually raise the bar was impressive and it is hard to argue against him being the best driver in F1 right now. With Verstappen on board the team's future looks incredibly bright. The team operated at a top level too. Red Bull out-developed and out-strategised its rivals throughout the year and continually underlined the strength of the whole F1 operation -- head of strategy Hannah Schmitz was one of the heroes of the team's campaign. The world champions had to deal with engine supplier Honda officially withdrawing from F1, but later struck a deal to continue using one of the best power units in F1 until the end of 2025. Early reliability issues threatened the team's championship challenge in the early weeks of the year but once the team was on top of those problems, it never looked back.\n\nWhat went wrong: Optics and reputational damage. The team's 2021 budget cap overspend cast a shadow over the achievement of winning both F1 titles for the first time since 2013. Red Bull was hit with a $7 million fine and will lose 10 percent of its aerodynamic testing allowance next year. Red Bull was already due to have the lowest allocation of any team, having won the championship, raising the possibility it could struggle to keep pace with the development of Ferrari and Mercedes next year. Then there was Brazil, where Verstappen refused a simple request to help his dutiful teammate Sergio Perez in his bid to finish second in the drivers' championship. It made Verstappen look petulant and disrespectful and, worst of all, made the team look powerless to control their superstar driver. Red Bull took the blame, but the damage was done. Team harmony is now a big question-mark and the whole saga may set up an interesting situation if Verstappen needs Perez's help in a tighter championship fight next season.\n\n2. Ferrari\n\nPeter J Fox/Getty Images\n\nWhat went right: Returning to the front. Ferrari's car was the cream of the crop in winter testing and started with two Charles Leclerc wins from three races early on. The team had clearly made good decisions in the preceding year in terms of car design, after two years woefully off the pace following its private settlement with the FIA for running an illegal engine in 2019. Building a more competitive car than the all-conquering Mercedes outfit was a feather in the cap and it did manage to secure second in the championship. Although the season did not end with the championship win many had hoped, Ferrari has set a good baseline for future seasons and is not as far from contention as in previous years.\n\nWhat went wrong: Strategy, car reliability, driver errors -- the list is long. Not long after those two early wins, Ferrari's season imploded. The team made many baffling strategy calls and its radio communications with drivers became a source of comedy at the end of the season, with Leclerc especially sounding fed up with things at recent events. Team boss Mattia Binotto infamously declared there was no reason the team couldn't win the final 10 races of the season, only for the team not to win any of them. Binotto's job appears to be hanging by a thread now and it is clear big changes are needed if Ferrari wants to be a champion any time soon. The team cannot shoulder all the blame, though. Leclerc and Carlos Sainz made their fair share of mistakes at big moments which only worsened the team's woes through the year.\n\n3. Mercedes\n\nPeter J Fox/Getty Images\n\nWhat went right: The team's driver pairing and emergence of George Russell. Valtteri Bottas' performances were a weak point of the team in previous years but with Russell at the helm alongside Lewis Hamilton, the team has two superstar drivers. Mercedes quite comfortably has the best driver lineup on the grid right now. Russell lived up to all expectations and beat Hamilton's points haul over a season -- only the third teammate to do that in 16 years. He scored a memorable first win in Brazil, the team's only victory. Hamilton started slowly but was back to his best by midseason and it is clear the fire is burning within him as much as ever. If Mercedes can build a title-worthy car and avoid internal conflict, it will be a formidable pairing for any team to beat.\n\nWhat went wrong: The car. Mercedes' championship challenge seemed over before the season had even started. The W13 featured a radical concept, different to any other car on the grid, and it immediately created problems for the team. The car was known for how it bounced at high speeds earlier in the year -- a phenomenon known as porpoising. It meant Mercedes started on the back foot, which was a fall from grace after eight seasons at the front of the pack. The team managed to solve early problems and developed well over the year, but it was never a legitimate contender for the title. Toto Wolff has vowed to put the troublesome car in the reception of the team's two factories next season to remind employees how difficult it is to win in Formula One.\n\n4. Alpine\n\nJakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nWhat went right: Beating McLaren to fourth. Realistically, this was the best the French team could hope for this year, with F1's top three clearly a step ahead of the rest. Esteban Ocon and Fernando Alonso were two of 2022's in-form drivers and there were only three races Alpine failed to score a point at. With a lot of questions about the long-term vision of the Renault factory outfit, this result was a sign that, whatever might be going wrong behind the scenes, the team is at least on a good path in terms of its car.\n\nWhat went wrong: Team management and reliability. It was a bad look for the French team to lose Alonso and Oscar Piastri to rival teams in the space of a week. The handling of mega-talented junior driver Piastri, for so long considered the future of the team, was farcical, while Alonso was happy to take a step down the grid to Aston Martin after Alpine dithered on his contract extension. It seems the in-fighting and mismanagement which has plagued the Renault operation since it returned to F1 in 2016 has not gone away. Although it finished fourth, Alonso regularly called out the team's spotty reliability record and it will need to get on top of this if it wants to continue an upward trajectory without the Spaniard at the helm.\n\n5. McLaren\n\nANP via Getty Images\n\nWhat went right: Lando Norris. McLaren extended Norris' F1 contract until 2025 at the start of the season. It will be money well spent. By finishing 'best of the rest', a term Norris said he does not actually like, the British driver was one of the year's standout performers and the only driver outside of the top three teams to score a podium, which he did at Imola. Norris is one of the best long-term prospects in F1 right now. He did not win a race but, unlike his missed opportunity in Sochi last year, McLaren was never in the mix for victory. When Norris gets a competitive car there can be little doubt he will be a contender for victories and championships in future.\n\nWhat went wrong: Daniel Ricciardo and a car stranded in the midfield. While Norris excelled in one car, Ricciardo floundered in the other, scoring a staggering 82 fewer points than his teammate. CEO Zak Brown cut the Australian's deal short one year early, a decision understandable in the context of Ricciardo's results since joining McLaren in 2021. Ricciardo wasn't the only concern. McLaren came into the season hoping to make the top three a pack of four teams, but it seemed further away from the front this year and never came close to challenging for a win. There has been progress under Brown but this famous F1 team might be stuck in the midfield for a little while yet. The longer that wait goes on, the harder it will be to convince Norris to stay.\n\n6. Alfa Romeo\n\nLars Baron/Getty Images\n\nWhat went right: Audi, Valtteri Bottas and finishing sixth. Bottas was a superb signing by the Swiss team and the Finn was at the center of the Hinwil operation's best championship result since finishing sixth as Sauber in 2012. Bottas scored 49 of the teams 55 points, showing how valuable that kind of experience can be to a midfield team with a competitive car. Rookie driver Zhou Guanyu is unpolished but may have the talent to stay in F1 for a while if he can show progress next year. On top of everything else, Alfa Romeo secured a huge partnership with German manufacturing giants Audi for 2026, which will be a huge boost for the future of a team that has won just one race in its 26 years on the F1 grid. Good times await.\n\nWhat went wrong: Reliability. Despite the strong result, Alfa had one of the worst reliability records on the grid. During the European rounds Alfa's cars seemed to hit an issue every weekend and that surely left a huge haul of points on the table across the season. Over the final 12 races the team added just four points to its tally and ended up tied on 55 with Aston Martin. Bottas' fifth-place finish at Imola -- which neither Aston driver could match -- won a tiebreaker, but it shows you how costly those issues might have been. The two cars' starts were also terrible all year, something the drivers put down to clutch issues.\n\n7. Aston Martin\n\nDan Istitene - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images\n\nWhat went right: Convincing Alonso to join the project. Alonso is exactly the kind of driver Aston Martin needs to achieve Lawrence Stroll's lofty ambitions of running at the front of the grid in a few years. Stroll has shown he is willing to spend big to achieve his goals and this was an indication of how serious he is. Alonso, who joins on a three-year deal, has no issues publicly calling out a team for poor performances or reliability and he might be the driving force the team needs internally to move up the order. He remains one of F1's most talented drivers and, as long as Aston Martin can manage his ego the right way, Alonso will be a huge boost to the team going forward. It is clear he is as fired up as ever, which is always as good thing.\n\nWhat went wrong: A lack of competitiveness. Aston Martin's car is still a long way from looking like one that can challenge for anything meaningful in F1. Stroll has invested heavily in a new factory opposite the Silverstone circuit but it is only just coming online and was completed too late to have an impact on the 2022 campaign. The most worrying thing this year will be how far behind the Alpine/McLaren battle Aston Martin found itself, with Sebastian Vettel and Lance Stroll often fighting at the lower end of the order in qualifying and races. Aston Martin is a long way away from proving it is a team moving in the right direction.\n\n8. Haas\n\nPeter J Fox/Getty Images\n\nWhat went right: The return of Kevin Magnussen and a new title sponsor. The team's future seemed uncertain when it cut ties with Uralkali at the start of the year, but it bounced back superbly. K-Mag's return was a great sporting comeback story and showed why the team is now going for the experienced Nico Hulkenberg over the error-prone Mick Schumacher -- experience is key. Magnussen scored the bulk of Haas' points at the start of the season and that proved vital in finishing ahead of AlphaTauri for eighth in the championship. Ahead of the U.S. Grand Prix, Haas confirmed the arrival of MoneyGram as title sponsor, which team boss Guenther Steiner said will allow the team to spend at the top end of the cost cap. The team will hopefully be able to turn its attentions to a return to the midfield pack in future years.\n\nWhat went wrong: Money and Mick. In the period between Uralkali and MoneyGram, it was clear how strapped for cash Haas was this year. The team had to delay a planned upgrade midway through the year and it slipped down the order as other teams developed their cars. Haas' cause was not helped by Schumacher's expensive crashes in the opening races, which left them worried about running out of spare parts at some races. Schumacher showed glimpses of form after that but ultimately not enough to keep his job. Although MoneyGram is a boost, Haas lost ground to several midfield rivals in the spell without a title partner in a crucial year in this new generation of cars - the first year sets the baseline for what is to come.\n\n9. AlphaTauri\n\nClive Mason - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images\n\nWhat went right: Not a lot. The team managed to snag the talented Nyck de Vries as a replacement to the outgoing Pierre Gasly, which was a good bit of business. However, that was arguably better news for Gasly, as he finally got a move back up the grid, and for Red Bull as a whole, finding a suitable replacement for its driver programme. It says a lot about AlphaTauri's season that it is difficult to write much more here. In terms of its finishing position, this was the team's worst season in F1 for a long time.\n\nWhat went wrong: Pretty much everything.

The French driver has been the team's superstar since he dropped back down from Red Bull in 2018 and his heroics might be missed next year. The jury is still out on Yuki Tsunoda, who shows flashes of real talent every so often but going into his third year seems far from the finished product Red Bull and AlphaTauri want him to be.\n\n10. Williams\n\nClive Rose/Getty Images\n\nWhat went right: Alex Albon. No-one in F1 thought the Thai driver deserved to leave the sport after 2020 and his return was a feel-good story -- and, crucially for Williams, he showed why he belonged in F1 this year.

            "text": "One year on from the aerodynamic revolution that promised closer racing, the 2023 Formula One season should offer a better indication of how close that is to reality.\n\nLast campaign was a step in the right direction for the series, but too often on-track battles were decided by the drag reduction system (DRS), first introduced to Formula One in 2011 to increase overtaking opportunities.\n\nThe hope this season is that complaints will relate solely to the topic of on-track action, with the sport\u2019s politics threatening to overshadow the racing on countless occasions in recent years.\n\nTo combat this, International Automobile Federation (FIA) president Mohammed Ben Sulayem has decided to step back from Formula One, with newly installed single-seater director Nikolas Tombazis handling the day-to-day operations.\n\nThis should relax the atmosphere somewhat in the paddock, which has grown increasingly frustrated with the FIA meddling with Formula One issues. What still needs to be addressed is the organising body\u2019s ability to provide clear communication to teams and fans on race weekends, with incidents at the Italian and Japanese Grands Prix last season drawing particular ire.\n\nWhatever happens throughout the season, it will only be a matter of time before attention turns to the inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix. With setup costs expected to pass US$500 million and Formula One promoting the event itself, the series will want to draw as much attention to the race as possible.\n\nThis season also sees the return of the Qatar Grand Prix, which made its debut in 2021 ahead of the start of a ten-year contract this year. One race that will be missing is the Chinese Grand Prix, despite its current contract with Formula One until 2025, as the country\u2019s strict Covid restrictions made hosting the race in 2023 impractical.\n\nBlackBook presents its annual rundown of all the commercial details you need to know.\n\nSponsors\n\nGlobal partners\n\nAramco, AWS, Crypto.com, DHL, Heineken, MSC Cruises, Pirelli, Qatar Airways, Rolex, Salesforce\n\nOfficial partners\n\nFerrari Trento, Lenovo, Liqui Moly\n\nRegional partners\n\n188Bet, Workday\n\nOfficial providers\n\nAlphaTauri, BBS Motorsport, Cyderes, Tata Communications\n\nTeams\n\nAlfa Romeo\n\nOwners: Longbow Finance (75%) and Audi (25%)\n\nChief executive: Andreas Seidl\n\nManaging director: Alessandro Alunni Bravi (also team representative)\n\nDrivers: Valtteri Bottas and Zhou Guanyu\n\nBase: Hinwil, Switzerland\n\nPower unit: Ferrari\n\nTitle sponsor: Stake (AUS$140 million, three-year deal, signed 2023)\n\nOther partners: Accelleron, Additive Industries, AMX, Assos, AximTrade, Camozzi, Cielo, Ciesse Piumini, Code Zero, Corinthian Re, Curam Domi, Delsey, Edelweiss, Everdome, Ferrari Trento, GlobeAir, Hyland, JigSpace, Kick, Marelli, MindMaze, Mitsubishi Electric, Pirelli, Puma, Rebellion, R-M, Sabelt, Save the Children, Seagate, SenseTime, Singha, Socios, Walter Meier, Web Eyewear, WhistlePig\n\nWhat they\u2019ve been up to: This is set to be the last year of the Alfa Romeo name, as the Italian brand will conclude its partnership with Sauber at the end of this season.

An all-French lineup for a French team should be a commercially sound decision, but rumours of a tetchy relationship between the two drivers may make certain brands apprehensive about jumping on board, especially if Ocon\u2019s history of clashing with teammates resurfaces.\n\nAlpine will run an all-pink livery for the first three races of the season, before reverting to their traditional blue colours\n\nAlphaTauri\n\nOwner: Red Bull\n\nTeam principal: Franz Tost\n\nDrivers: Nyck de Vries and Yuki Tsunoda\n\nBase: Faenza, Italy\n\nPower unit: Honda\n\nTitle sponsor: AlphaTauri\n\nPrincipal partner: PKN Orlen (multi-year deal signed in 2023)\n\nOther partners: Buzz, Carl Friedrik, Epicor, FlexBox, GMG, P448, Pirelli, Randstad, RapidAPI, Ravenol, Riedel, Siemens, XMTrading\n\nWhat they\u2019ve been up to: AlphaTauri are taking the unusual step of having a brand from outside the Red Bull family on their rear wing by signing a multi-year deal with Polish oil refiner PKN Orlen.\n\nPerhaps highlighting the greater independence of the team, this is only the second time a brand not associated with Red Bull will have such prominent visibility. Even then, the previous brand, Cepsa, which appeared on the rear wing in the early 2010s, was heavily linked to the career of then Red Bull prospect Carlos Sainz Jr.\n\nWith Nyck De Vries joining the team for 2023, this is the first time a driver without prior links to the Red Bull junior academy will drive for either AlphaTauri or Toro Rosso.\n\nCould we see Honda looking for greater involvement as it searches for a way back into the sport in 2026, perhaps even as a factory team?\n\nPKN Orlen receives prominent branding on this year\u2019s AlphaTauri, including on the halo and rear wing\n\nAston Martin\n\nOwner: Lawrence Stroll\n\nChief executive: Martin Whitmarsh\n\nTeam principal: Mike Krack\n\nDrivers: Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll\n\nBase: Silverstone, UK\n\nPower unit: Mercedes\n\nTitle sponsor: Cognizant (up to UK\u00a330 million per year, multi-year deal, signed 2021)\n\nPrincipal partner: Aramco (multi-year deal, signed 2021)\n\nOther partners: Alpinestars, AvaTrade, Bombardier, Boss, Citi, Crypto.com, ebb3, EPOS, Girard-Perregaux, Globe-Trotter, JCB, Juniper Networks, NetApp, Oakley, OGIO, Pelmark, Peroni, Pirelli, Porto Seguro, SentinelOne, Socios, Stilo, TikTok, XP\n\nWhat they\u2019ve been up to: Formula One\u2019s first ever \u2018smart factory\u2019 is nearing completion, with the first section of Aston Martin\u2019s new base set to be finalised in May 2023. Lawrence Stroll is serious about turning this operation into a leading team and, while it may be several years before the benefits of the factory are felt, the signing of two-time world champion Fernando Alonso highlights the ambition.\n\nThe team has also been very active in the commercial space during the offseason, signing deals with Citi, AvaTrade and Globe-Trotter. The team also showed its environmental commitment by achieving the ISO14001 Environmental Management Standard, adding to its three-star environmental accreditation awarded by the FIA.\n\nFerrari\n\nOwner: Ferrari\n\nTeam principal: Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Vasseur\n\nDrivers: Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz Jr\n\nBase: Maranello, Italy\n\nPower unit: Ferrari\n\nTitle sponsor: N/A\n\nOther partners: AWS, Bang & Olufsen, Bell Helmets, Bitdefender, Brembo, CEVA Logistics, Ecopol, Estrella Galicia 0.0, Frecciarossa, Garrett, Genesys, Giorgio Armani, Harman Automotive, HCL Software, Iveco, Mahle, ManpowerGroup, Mission Winnow, NGK Spark Plugs, \u00d6hlins Racing, OMR, Palantir, Pirelli, Puma, Ray-Ban, Richard Mille, Riedel, Riva, Sabelt, Santander, Shell, SKF, TechnoGym, VistaJet\n\nWhat they\u2019ve been up to: After a year that promised a fight for the title but culminated in Charles Leclerc securing second place in the standings at the final race of the season, change was required at Ferrari. Mattia Binotto departed as team principal after three years and the experienced Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Vasseur has stepped in to steer the Italian team back on track.\n\nCommercially, Ferrari have seen both Velas and Snapdragon end their contracts early, with the cancellation of the former rumoured to be leading to legal action. The historic team should have no problems filling the reported US$55 million hole left by the departures, but as of yet no major partnerships to replace them have been agreed.\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Vasseur has moved from Alfa Romeo to become Ferrari\u2019s new team principal\n\nHaas\n\nOwner: Gene Haas\n\nTeam principal: G\u00fcnther Steiner\n\nDrivers: Nico H\u00fclkenberg and Kevin Magnussen\n\nBase: Kannapolis, US and Banbury, UK\n\nPower unit: Ferrari\n\nTitle sponsor: MoneyGram (up to US$20 million per year, three-year deal, signed 2022)\n\nOther partners: Alpinestars, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Haas Automation, Haas Tooling, Hantec Markets, Oakberry, OpenSea, Palm Angels, Pirelli, Schuberth, Taittinger, TravisMathew, Tricorp Workwear\n\nWhat they\u2019ve been up to: Haas will have a new title sponsor for 2023 after signing a deal with MoneyGram worth US$20 million per year. The three-year contract will reportedly see the American team operate at the budget cap, something it has not been able to do before due to lack of funding.\n\nThe team will hope that this partnership proves less controversial than its previous deals with Uralkali and Rich Energy. However, the team is increasingly attractive to American brands, with the likes of Chipotle Mexican Grill and TravisMathew signing up with the team recently.\n\nMcLaren Racing\n\nOwners: McLaren Group and MSP Sports Capital (minority owner)\n\nChief executive: Zak Brown\n\nTeam principal: Andrea Stella\n\nDrivers: Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri\n\nBase: Woking, UK\n\nPower unit: Mercedes\n\nTitle sponsor: N/A\n\nPrincipal partner: OKX (multi-year deal, signed 2022)\n\nOther partners: AkzoNobel-Sikkens, Alteryx, Arrow Electronics, Android, Ashurst, British American Tobacco, Cadence, Castore, Chrome, CNBC, Coca-Cola, Darktrace, Dell Technologies, Deloitte, DeWalt, DP World, EasyPost, FAI Aviation Group, FxPro, Goldman Sachs, Gopuff, Hilton, Immersive Labs, Jack Daniel\u2019s, KAUST, Logitech, Medallia, Mind, PartyCasino, PartyPoker, Pirelli, Richard Mille, Smartsheet, Sparco, Splunk, Stratasys, SunGod, Tezos, TUMI, Unilever, VMware, Webex by Cisco\n\nWhat they\u2019ve been up to: This season will see the fruits of last year\u2019s prolonged contract wrangling with Alpine, as the highly rated Oscar Piastri will debut for McLaren. It\u2019s reported that the team paid Daniel Ricciardo US$15 million to switch him out for his younger compatriot, but McLaren will also be missing out on the commercial popularity of the Aussie. Despite not having a spot on the Formula One grid, he still appeared on the The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to help promote Formula One to the US audience.\n\nThe team is still securing deals at a high rate, though, with the likes of Jack Daniel\u2019s and K-Swiss agreeing deals last season for the start of 2023. Most recently, former Renault title sponsor DP World has joined the team to support McLaren\u2019s logistics operation.\n\nMercedes-AMG\n\nOwner: Daimler AG (33 per cent), Ineos (33 per cent), Toto Wolff (33 per cent)\n\nChief executive: Toto Wolff (also team principal)\n\nDrivers: Lewis Hamilton and George Russell\n\nBase: Brackley, UK\n\nPower unit: Mercedes\n\nTitle partner: Petronas (up to US$75 million per year, extended beyond 2026 in 2022)\n\nPrincipal partner: Ineos (UK\u00a320 million a year, signed 2019, expires 2024)\n\nOther partners: Akkodis, AMD, CrowdStrike, Eight Sleep, Einhell, Endless Brake Technology Europe AB, Fastly, G42, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IWC Schaffhausen, Marriott Bonvoy, mCloud, Monster Energy, Nuvei, OZ Racing, Pirelli, Police, Puma, Pure Storage, Sherwin Williams, Snapdragon, Solera, TeamViewer, Tommy Hilfiger, UBS\n\nWhat they\u2019ve been up to: The Brackley-based team endured a difficult 2022, with its on-track performance leaving Lewis Hamilton and George Russell rarely able to fight near the front. Off the track, Mercedes were one of the high-profile sports teams to lose out from the collapse of FTX, which had a partnership with the Formula One outfit.\n\nRecent partnerships have been secured with Nuvei, Qualcomm and G42, and the team has returned to an all-black livery. That can double up as a weight-saving exercise and a vehicle through which Hamilton can continue his activism in the face of the FIA\u2019s efforts to clamp down on drivers\u2019 freedom to speak.\n\nMercedes have switched back to an all-black livery for the 2023 season, the same colour scheme the team used in 2020 and 2021 in support of diversity and equality\n\nRed Bull Racing\n\nOwner: Red Bull\n\nChief executive: Christian Horner (also team principal)\n\nDrivers: Sergio P\u00e9rez and Max Verstappen\n\nBase: Milton Keynes, UK\n\nPower unit: Honda\n\nTitle sponsor: Oracle (US$300 million in total, signed 2022, expires 2026)\n\nOther partners: AlphaTauri, Ansys, Arctic Wolf, Armor All, AT&T, Blenders Eyewear, BMC, Built for Athletes, Bybit, Cash App, Castore, Claro, DMG Mori, Gold Standard, Hard Rock, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Hexagon, Inter.mx, Mobil 1, New Era, Ocean Bottle, Pirelli, PokerStars, Poly, PWR, Rauch, Rokt, Siemens, Tag Heuer, Telcel, Therabody, Walmart, Zoom\n\nWhat they\u2019ve been up to: On the back of securing their first constructors\u2019 championship since 2013, Red Bull are the team to beat. While Honda is returning in a technical support capacity, the big news that developed during the offseason is that the Milton Keynes-based team will be partnering with US auto giant Ford from the 2026 campaign.\n\n2023 marks the first year of Castore\u2019s supply deal with the team, adding to the company\u2019s existing Formula One deal with McLaren. This will also be the second year of Red Bull\u2019s five-year, US$300 million contract with Oracle \u2013 although most of the season will be spent under restrictions following the team\u2019s breach of the financial regulations last season.\n\nWilliams Racing\n\nOwner: Dorilton Capital\n\nTeam principal: James Vowles\n\nDrivers: Alex Albon and Logan Sargeant\n\nBase: Grove, UK\n\nPower unit: Mercedes\n\nTitle sponsor: N/A\n\nOther partners: Acronis, Bremont, Broadcom Software, Crew Clothing Company, Dorilton Ventures, Dtex, Duracell, Financial Times, Gulf, KX, Life Fitness, Michelob Ultra, OMP, Pirelli, PPG, PureStream, Spinal Injuries Association, Stephens, Umbro, Zeiss\n\nWhat they\u2019ve been up to: After conducting an interview with Forbes looking ahead to the future, it was a surprise to see chief executive Jost Capito retire during the offseason, leaving Williams with the unenviable task of finding a replacement.\n\nMercedes motorsport strategy director James Vowles was eventually appointed his replacement, with the existing communication channels between Mercedes and Williams likely making the decision a more straightforward one. His lack of experience at the top level will be put under the microscope this season, especially with the rumoured financial difficulties currently facing the Grove-based team.\n\nRookie driver Logan Sargeant has become the first graduate of the Williams young driver programme, although this is to replace pay driver Nicholas Latifi, who leaves with a significant portion of funding. The recent multi-year deal agreed with Gulf is likely only a fraction of this lost funding, with reports placing it in the region of US$4 million per year.\n\nMajor broadcast partners\n\nThe BlackBook is a 360 degree media platform, supported by SportsPro, covering the business behind global motorsport across print, digital and events.

            "article_html": "<div><h3>Red Bull</h3>\n<p>Red Bull looked to be struggling slightly in final practice, with both drivers unhappy with their car balance. But once the sun set, the Bulls came to the fore. They looked to be in an incredibly tight battle in qualifying with Ferrari, Aston Martin and Mercedes. But when it mattered, Verstappen put in a scintillating lap to grab the opening pole of the season, with Perez ensuring a front row lock out for the team.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.verstappen-explains-why-hes-particularly-happy-with-bahrain-pole-after.4ammV6OLRPd0RNx1hPVyTB.html\">READ MORE: Verstappen explains why he&#8217;s &#8216;particularly happy&#8217; with Bahrain pole after &#8216;unusual&#8217; approach by Red Bull</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Max Verstappen, 1st, 1:29.708</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very happy to be on pole, it hasn&#8217;t been the easiest weekend so far as we&#8217;ve been struggling to find the right balance and I&#8217;ve been trying to find my rhythm. Overall, it was quite a good qualifying, we recovered well with the performance. It&#8217;s great for the whole Team to have a one-two start tomorrow, and to have Checo up there as well is really promising. A lot of things can happen during a race as we all know, but I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing what we can do out there on track as a Team.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Sergio Perez, 2nd, 1:29.846</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;When you miss pole position by a tenth of a second you always think there is a bit more you could have given, that is only a braking zone or something. It was really close out there today, look at the competition from Q2 and Q3, if you didn&#8217;t get a perfect lap then you were P5. We made some compromises in qualifying for tomorrow&#8217;s race and hopefully that will pay off so we can have a very strong race car. I am more comfortable with the car; the rear end of this car is a bit more planted, so I am able to work with it a little better so that&#8217;s a positive for me. I think Ferrari will be in the mix for the race, along with Aston Martin and Mercedes. We hadn&#8217;t seen this kind of pace from Ferrari until today, so I think they have been hiding quite a bit. If Charles was to do his final run, he would have been in with a shot for pole position. I think managing the tyre degradation will be crucial tomorrow and it will be really important for us to concentrate on our own race.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Christian Horner, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Great start to the season in what turned out to be a very close qualifying. Both drivers managed to navigate their way into Q3 with the two sets of the softer tyres available. To lock out the front row is the best possible start for tomorrow&#8217;s race, but, the points are on Sunday, and as we know from last year, it&#8217;s important to finish. As I say though, it&#8217;s a great start from the drivers and the Team, but plenty of work still to do as we look to convert these excellent grid positions into points tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Pole position qualifier Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle Red Bull Racing prepares\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Sergio Perez of Mexico driving the (11) Oracle Red Bull Racing RB19 on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">3</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Pole position qualifier Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle Red Bull Racing and Second placed qualifier Sergio Perez of Mexico and Oracle Red Bull Racing talk in parc ferme during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

It looked like Ferrari were right in the fight, despite some early dramas as Leclerc lost a couple of pieces of bodywork after locking up on his initial lap at the start of qualifying. But the team opted not to send Leclerc out for a second push lap in Q3, opting instead to save a fresh set of softs for the race itself. Sainz did go out for a second run after a small mistake on his opening effort and improved to ensure Ferrari have two cars on the second row.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.it-would-have-been-close-leclerc-explains-q3-tactics-as-he-trades-pole-shot.hpvSg7awIpDrf8JXtXuSL.html\">READ MORE: &#8216;It would have been close&#8217; &#8211; Leclerc explains Q3 tactics as he trades pole shot for improved race strategy</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Charles Leclerc, 3rd, 1:30.000</strong></p>\n<p>\"A positive qualifying. We were in the fight for pole, which we didn't expect coming into the weekend. Several teams seem to be quite close, which makes things more exciting for drivers and fans, and I think it's good for the sport.\nIn terms of race pace, we could find ourselves a bit on the backfoot, as our competitors looked very strong in that area during free practice. We will give everything tomorrow and, with an extra set of fresh Soft tyres, hopefully we will have a good fight.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Carlos Sainz, 4th, 1:30.154</strong></p>\n<p>\"Today we made a step forward as a team. It&#8217;s been a difficult build-up to qualifying for me, not having had a clean day yesterday, but we reacted well today. I lost a bit in sector 2 in a couple of twitchy corners, but apart from that the feeling overall was better.</p>\n<p>\"Now we&#8217;re looking forward to tomorrow. We&#8217;ll fight until the very last lap and try to bring home a good result to get the season going.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Fred Vasseur, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>\"It&#8217;s always difficult to have a clear picture going into the very first qualifying of the season, as you come here not knowing where the others are, but in the end we got a good result today. We were P1 in both Q1 and Q2 so it was looking good for the fight for pole, but then we decided with Charles to save one set of new tyres for tomorrow&#8217;s race, whereas with Carlos we used another new set since it was such a tight qualifying and a new tyre made the difference. Starting from the second row is actually a positive result considering that we will have the only driver with an extra set of new Soft tyres, so I am more than happy with this first qualifying. For tomorrow, when the points are scored, we need to put everything together and manage degradation. We have carried out some good race simulations, it&#8217;s a long season and tomorrow&#8217;s race is just the first step.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Carlos Sainz of Spain driving the (55) Ferrari SF-23 on track during\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Third placed qualifier Charles Leclerc of Monaco and Ferrari looks on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Carlos Sainz of Spain driving the (55) Ferrari SF-23 on track during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

Last year the team found itself out of Q1 and now we are lining up fifth on the grid. Everyone in the team has done an amazing job and this is a strong baseline to build upon as we start the season. We shall see what tomorrow brings, but we have been competitive in all the sessions and we are starting close to the podium positions. If there is an opportunity there for the taking, then we will look to capitalise on it.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Lance Stroll, 8th, 1:30.836</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I am really happy with today&#8217;s result. It shows the progress we have made as a team over the winter and that our hard work is paying off. From eighth we can race well and hopefully bring home some points tomorrow. I have spent the practice sessions doing my best to learn about the car, get up to speed, and find a rhythm as we built up to qualifying. I am really pleased with the performance I put in today and feeling grateful to be here just two weeks after my accident. I cannot wait to go racing tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Mike Krack, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;To get both cars through to Q3 in fifth and eighth is an excellent outcome from the first qualifying session of the year. I must say a big well done to the whole team &#8211; back at base and here at the track &#8211; for their constant hard work to get us to this point. The goal has been to take a step forward and our performance across today indicates we have done just that. We can race well from those grid positions and target scoring points with both cars. Huge credit to Lance for his performance today, especially given his situation, and having missed all of winter testing. His determination to get back in the car has been very impressive and he has done a super job to qualify in eighth. Fernando, too, delivered a strong performance tonight, with clean and tidy laps to take fifth, building on the speed we have shown during practice. Tomorrow is what really counts, though, and we will work hard to convert these positions into points.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: 5th placed qualifier Fernando Alonso of Spain and Aston Martin F1 Team\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Lance Stroll of Canada driving the (18) Aston Martin AMR23 Mercedes on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: 5th placed qualifier Fernando Alonso of Spain and Aston Martin F1 Team looks on in parc ferme during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

But in Q3, when the others began to turn their engines up, Mercedes fell back somewhat. Given they only had one run each and had to go out midway through before the track had fully ramped up, it certainly isn&#8217;t all doom and gloom for the Silver Arrows, but both drivers will have their work cut out to move forward in what looks an incredibly tight front pack.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.russell-targeting-bahrain-gp-podium-fight-as-mercedes-drivers-prepare-to.17EyVoyiYQs4cbjF6SHxyU.html\">READ MORE: Russell targeting Bahrain GP podium fight as Mercedes drivers prepare to take on &#8216;unknown&#8217; Alonso</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Lewis Hamilton, 7th, 1:30.384</strong></p>\n<p>\"I thought today may be worse than it ended up being. We did some great work overnight and the car felt much better in FP3. Overall, Qualifying was OK. I thought we might struggle to get into Q3 yesterday, but we didn't. We were in a fight. We don't know if we have the same race pace that we showed last year but I'm hoping we can be in the fight amongst the group behind Red Bull. It's really all going to depend on what our long-run pace is like. I am genuinely happy for Aston Martin. It's amazing to see their progress and the steps that they have taken. I am happy for Fernando as he's been here way longer than me so it's good to have him back in the mix! I'm sure we will have some good races.\"</p>\n<p><strong>George Russell, 6th, 1:30.340</strong></p>\n<p>\"Today was a lot better than we expected, particularly after yesterday. We had a tough Friday; we expected to add a little bit of performance overnight, but we exceeded expectations. The changes we made we thought we might find a tenth, but we found close to five or six tenths, so we need to fully understand why that was. It's positive news but after FP3, we just focused on maximising performance. The car is feeling nice to drive so we are in a much better starting place than we were with the W13. We can now focus on adding global performance rather than problem solving. Tomorrow, we are in a good place to fight for third. Qualifying three tenths behind Ferrari when they have probably been the fastest car on single lap pace is positive. Fernando is probably more of a dark horse than Ferrari.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport</strong></p>\n<p>\"The gap to the very front isn't ridiculous considering we only ran one new soft tyre at the end of Q3. Nevertheless, it's not where we want to be and not what we had aimed for over the winter. We know what the gap is and what we need to find, or more, to win. Neither driver had a clean lap in the final run. There was probably another tenth-and-a-half still in there but it likely wouldn't have changed much. We maybe could have overtaken Alonso with both cars, but this is where we are. We are super critical of ourselves and what we need to achieve. There is no such thing as a sacred cow in our team, and we look at everything. The whole Team thinks like that, so we just need to get our heads together and work out the next steps from here. But first we race tomorrow - and we will be giving it everything we've got to move forward up the field.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director</strong></p>\n<p>\"Clearly, we're disappointed to be so far off pole, but we looked much further off yesterday. It's encouraging that the car responded to the overnight changes, and we've managed to improve a few of the issues like the high-speed cornering. Through the morning session the car was behaving quite predictably given the hotter conditions. There was a bit of fine-tuning going into qualifying and early on, it looked like we were in a pretty good place. As the sessions went on the others seemed to be finding a bit more pace. We also only had one set of tyres for the final part of Qualifying so that added up to leaving us with a gap that's bigger than we'd like but one that we'll be working hard to close down. Our straight-line speed looks strong, and our degradation seems to be in a reasonable place; the Red Bulls are out of reach from what we have seen but it would be good if we can get into a race with the Ferraris and Aston Martins.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: George Russell of Great Britain driving the (63) Mercedes AMG Petronas\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W14 on track during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

He was out anyway having only managed the 17th best time, before the stewards deemed he has exceeded track limits, which dropped him to P20. Ocon though used his experience to scrape into the top 10, one of only two midfield cars to do so. He starts ninth and will be looking to get his points tally up and running at the earliest of opportunities.</p>\n<p><strong>Esteban Ocon, 9th, 1:30.984</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It felt good to be out there and finally really pushing the car to see what it can do and where we stand. Getting through to Q3 is definitely a good way to start the season. We are happy with the progress we have made since the pre-season test, and this is the best the car has felt on track so far this year. Our competitors in front are quick, and we have plenty of work ahead of us, but we&#8217;ve got a car that can get into the points and that will be the goal for the first race of the season.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Pierre Gasly, 20th, 1:32.181</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Clearly, this is not the start to the season we wanted being knocked out in Q1, that said, it means we have everything to gain for tomorrow&#8217;s race and I&#8217;m definitely feeling positive that we can still come away with points from this weekend. Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t quite feel at one with the car today and that meant we were way below where our true level is. There&#8217;s a lot of work ahead of us to continue our understanding of the car and I&#8217;m confident we will come back stronger for our next qualifying session. My focus is on tomorrow and I&#8217;m really looking forward to the race and giving it my all.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Alan Permane, Sporting Director</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Overall, we have mixed feelings after today&#8217;s first Qualifying of the season with Esteban in ninth and Pierre in twentieth. In general, that&#8217;s not where we aim to be, and we certainly have improvements to make to ensure we&#8217;re qualifying in much stronger positions at later races. Pierre is certainly disappointed to be out in Q1. We have a lot to review on his side to understand what happened as clearly the car had much more pace than that. Esteban did a very good job and had three smooth sessions, though, looking at the timesheets, ninth place is probably where we deserve to be today. We&#8217;re definitely ready for tomorrow&#8217;s race as our high fuel running looked good in pre-season testing and in Free Practice 2 yesterday. Pierre can set his sights forward from the back of the grid as this race tends to have plenty of overtaking. For Esteban, he&#8217;s well in contention and there&#8217;s no reason why we cannot come away from here with good points.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: 20th placed qualifier Pierre Gasly of France and Alpine F1 walks in\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Esteban Ocon of France driving the (31) Alpine F1 A523 Renault on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: 20th placed qualifier Pierre Gasly of France and Alpine F1 walks in the Pitlane during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

I think it was pretty decent &#8211; I was pretty happy how I was able to produce and deliver the laps. I think we saw already yesterday how over one lap we&#8217;re in a decent spot and quite competitive, but the real test will come tomorrow.

It&#8217;s a little bit unfortunate but the race is tomorrow, and we&#8217;ll try to do better there.

Today was not his day but he knows what he can do and he&#8217;s upbeat about what the car is doing, so tomorrow is another day for him to score points. With Nico in Q3, we didn&#8217;t end up where we wanted to but P10 is very good for us. The whole team did a fantastic job and all the work that was put in last year and over winter to make and develop this car has come to fruition, so well done to everybody.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Nico Hulkenberg of Germany driving the (27) Haas F1 VF-23 Ferrari\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Kevin Magnussen of Denmark driving the (20) Haas F1 VF-23 Ferrari on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Nico Hulkenberg of Germany driving the (27) Haas F1 VF-23 Ferrari locks a wheel under braking during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

It&#8217;s a long race ahead tomorrow and a track we can overtake on, so hopefully we can move forward.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Oscar Piastri, 18th, 1:32.101</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Obviously it&#8217;s not what we were looking for there. The red flag compromised us a bit and I just didn&#8217;t nail it on the second set of tyres. That said, it was my first F1 qualifying and it is a long season ahead. We&#8217;ll do our homework and see what we can do. Tomorrow is another day.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>James Key, Executive Director, Technical</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Today saw a very busy first qualifying session of the season. Q1 was disrupted with a red flag and a scramble at the end of the session, which was a real shame as it left us with a compromised first run, with the tyres not up to temperature, and then a second run filled with traffic. Oscar just missed out, but he&#8217;s shown good pace all weekend and we know he can recover from this. He did a very disciplined job in his first qualifying session. Lando did a good job to get through to Q2 and narrowly missed out on the top 10.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We know we&#8217;ve got a bit of performance to find, and we have always said that was going to be the case with this configuration of car, but I have to say it was very, very close today. The grid has really tightened around us and it&#8217;s all to play for tomorrow. With decent long-run pace we can make good with both cars and target points tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: 18th placed qualifier Oscar Piastri of Australia and McLaren walks in\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Lando Norris of Great Britain driving the (4) McLaren MCL60 Mercedes\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: 18th placed qualifier Oscar Piastri of Australia and McLaren walks in the Pitlane during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

Nonetheless, it was a solid effort and with Zhou only 0.030s behind his team mate, it bodes well for a very close intra-team fight all season. If those two can keep pushing each other, points should follow.</p>\n<p><strong>Valtteri Bottas, 12th, 1:31.443</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a straightforward qualifying session for us, and starting from P12 we will be definitely aiming for a place in the points. I&#8217;m quite happy about the laps I delivered and it&#8217;s good to see how Zhou was able to push me as well: we were just a bit short of Q3, but the midfield is really close and everything can still happen. From what we have seen in testing, we are not bad in race trim, and it will be interesting to see how tyre degradation will affect different cars: it&#8217;s quite difficult to predict how the race will shape up, but we&#8217;re going to give it our best shot.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Zhou Guanyu, 13th, 1:31.473</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Even from outside of the top 10, I feel we have the potential to gain a few positions during tomorrow&#8217;s race: last year we were able to climb up the field, and I see no reason why we can&#8217;t repeat what we have done before. It will be a tight fight, once again, and points are definitely the target. Looking at our performance from practice, we are in the mix for the top ten and it will often be a case of who can put everything together on the day: we went really close to it today, but ultimately fell a bit short. Still, there&#8217;s everything to play for tomorrow and I&#8217;m confident we can do a good job.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Alessandro Alunni Bravi, Team Chief</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s result is a good first step and a platform on which we can build on to score points tomorrow. We can be happy about the way our team executed qualifying today: both drivers did well and the whole crew, here and in Hinwil, stood up to the task. We expected the midfield to be an incredibly tight affair, and tonight&#8217;s result confirms just how close the battle will be. There are minimal gaps between all the cars around us and a single tenth can make the difference between quite a few positions: even though we missed out on Q3, we are still in the mix for the points. Our focus shifts to Sunday now: we need to prepare our best race plan, making sure we find a way to make the most of the good long-run pace we showed in testing and practice. I am confident we can have a good showing tomorrow and deliver a good result to the team back at home.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Zhou Guanyu of China driving the (24) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari in the\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari in the Pitlane during final practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

As such, it was a decent effort by Tsunoda to make it into Q2, even if he couldn&#8217;t progress from there. De Vries couldn&#8217;t match that and exited in Q1, although Gasly&#8217;s track limit infringement saved the Dutchman from qualifying last.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.sargeant-piastri-and-de-vries-find-reasons-to-be-optimistic-despite-all.2g97SjXJvXiR5NrIY9kUJe.html\">READ MORE: Sargeant, Piastri and De Vries find reasons to be optimistic despite all three rookies dropping out in Q1 in Bahrain</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Nyck de Vries, 19th, 1:32.121</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We would&#8217;ve liked to qualify higher today, but I didn&#8217;t have the tyres in the correct window. The final lap in Q1 was crucial, but unfortunately, I lost the rear. Our long-run performance has been looking more promising than our short-run pace, so that should provide for more performance tomorrow. The midfield is tight and competitive, so we need to make sure we gain some positions. It will be challenge, but we have tonight to evaluate our data.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Yuki Tsunoda, 14th, 1:32.510</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t expect to get into Q2, but getting through was very positive for myself and the team. Of course, I was frustrated we didn&#8217;t have new tyres for Q2, but we knew that was the plan from the beginning. We haven&#8217;t tested the long-runs in these conditions, but we&#8217;ll dig through the data extensively tonight to be able to build the strongest possible car going into tomorrow, especially in terms of finding grip. At the same time, I am happy with my performance today, but ultimately tomorrow is when it counts. We are aiming for points, and we know it won&#8217;t be the easiest race from what we have learnt from testing last week, but anything can happen.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Jody Egginton, Technical Director</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We had a clear picture of what the primary limitations of the car were on Friday night, and it&#8217;s fair to say that the changes made overnight improved the balance of the car in FP3 &amp; qualifying. This is promising, but there is still much to do to get the car to where we want it. Yuki has delivered a good performance, extracting pretty much everything from the car, whilst Nyck has also put on a solid first qualifying. He&#8217;s made good progress, and more importantly, provided excellent feedback on what the car is doing and what he needs from it. As you would expect, we are not satisfied with the performance shown by the AT04 so far, but tomorrow&#8217;s race is another key milestone, and aero developments will be coming through in the next events.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Yuki Tsunoda of Scuderia AlphaTauri and Japan  during qualifying ahead\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Nyck de Vries of Netherlands driving the (21) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan and Scuderia AlphaTauri and Viki Gomez practice\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">3</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Yuki Tsunoda of Scuderia AlphaTauri and Japan  during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

It was a good showing from the American, who did say before the season that qualifying was his strength. As for Albon, he made Q2 but only ran once in that segment, and was fighting a very fidgety car. After running wide, he aborted his lap and didn&#8217;t set a time.</p>\n<p><strong>Logan Sargeant, 16th, 1:31.652</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It's a dream come true to go out and qualify in Formula 1. We had good pace today and the team deserved to have both cars in Q2. A slight mistake in Sector 1 cost me as I struggled to find my brake point with the change of wind at Turn 1. However, we've laid a good foundation for ourselves to build off going forward. I think we had the car in a great window this evening. In terms of balance it was right where I wanted it, I just needed to put it together slightly better.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It's going to be a pretty special feeling when the lights go out tomorrow. I'll try to get off the line clean, have a good first lap and build from there.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Alex Albon, 15th, No time set in Q2</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We had some front wing damage in Qualifying, and we lost one of the flaps, so we didn&#8217;t complete a lap in Q2. It&#8217;s disappointing as, looking at the times in Q2, I really believe we could have made it to Q3.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a bit disappointed after being P9 in Q1 and I feel like we deserved more than where we qualified but I think if you look at where we were this time last year and where we are at this year, apart from Aston Martin, we&#8217;re the team that has made the biggest step forward. I&#8217;m really proud of everyone at the team and at the factory and things are going in the right direction.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We really do come alive when the track becomes cold and I would say our race pace is stronger than our qualifying pace, so let&#8217;s see what happens tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Dave Robson, Head of Vehicle Performance</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;A frustrating result this evening but one that shows good promise. Logan was extremely unlucky not to get into Q2 having set the same lap time as Norris.\nWhilst Alex progressed to Q2 and was in a great position to set a good lap time, he had to abort his flying lap when an adjuster on his front wing failed, causing the flap to drop. Having completed so much running last week without an issue, it is frustrating to have it today in such an important session.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We can take a lot of positives from today as we look to translate the performance into a solid and forward-looking race plan. Both drivers know how to compile a strong race stint at this circuit, and everyone in Bahrain and in Grove are looking forward to helping them make good progress.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Logan Sargeant of United States driving the (2) Williams FW45 Mercedes\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Alexander Albon of Thailand and Williams prepares to drive in the\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Logan Sargeant of United States driving the (2) Williams FW45 Mercedes in the Pitlane during final practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

Qualifying was run entirely on the soft, given the performance gaps between the compounds, with Verstappen beating last year&#8217;s pole time from Charles Leclerc.

Overall, it was quite a good qualifying, we recovered well with the performance. It\u2019s great for the whole Team to have a one-two start tomorrow, and to have Checo up there as well is really promising.

It was really close out there today, look at the competition from Q2 and Q3, if you didn\u2019t get a perfect lap then you were P5. We made some compromises in qualifying for tomorrow\u2019s race and hopefully that will pay off so we can have a very strong race car. I am more comfortable with the car; the rear end of this car is a bit more planted, so I am able to work with it a little better so that\u2019s a positive for me. I think Ferrari will be in the mix for the race, along with Aston Martin and Mercedes. We hadn\u2019t seen this kind of pace from Ferrari until today, so I think they have been hiding quite a bit. If Charles was to do his final run, he would have been in with a shot for pole position. I think managing the tyre degradation will be crucial tomorrow and it will be really important for us to concentrate on our own race.\u201d Christian Horner, Team Principal \u201cGreat start to the season in what turned out to be a very close qualifying. Both drivers managed to navigate their way into Q3 with the two sets of the softer tyres available. To lock out the front row is the best possible start for tomorrow\u2019s race, but, the points are on Sunday, and as we know from last year, it\u2019s important to finish. As I say though, it\u2019s a great start from the drivers and the Team, but plenty of work still to do as we look to convert these excellent grid positions into points tomorrow.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 3 BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Pole position qualifier Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle Red Bull Racing and Second placed qualifier Sergio Perez of Mexico and Oracle Red Bull Racing talk in parc ferme during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

It looked like Ferrari were right in the fight, despite some early dramas as Leclerc lost a couple of pieces of bodywork after locking up on his initial lap at the start of qualifying. But the team opted not to send Leclerc out for a second push lap in Q3, opting instead to save a fresh set of softs for the race itself. Sainz did go out for a second run after a small mistake on his opening effort and improved to ensure Ferrari have two cars on the second row.

Several teams seem to be quite close, which makes things more exciting for drivers and fans, and I think it's good for the sport. In terms of race pace, we could find ourselves a bit on the backfoot, as our competitors looked very strong in that area during free practice.

It\u2019s been a difficult build-up to qualifying for me, not having had a clean day yesterday, but we reacted well today. I lost a bit in sector 2 in a couple of twitchy corners, but apart from that the feeling overall was better. \"Now we\u2019re looking forward to tomorrow. We\u2019ll fight until the very last lap and try to bring home a good result to get the season going.\" Fred Vasseur, Team Principal \"It\u2019s always difficult to have a clear picture going into the very first qualifying of the season, as you come here not knowing where the others are, but in the end we got a good result today. We were P1 in both Q1 and Q2 so it was looking good for the fight for pole, but then we decided with Charles to save one set of new tyres for tomorrow\u2019s race, whereas with Carlos we used another new set since it was such a tight qualifying and a new tyre made the difference. Starting from the second row is actually a positive result considering that we will have the only driver with an extra set of new Soft tyres, so I am more than happy with this first qualifying. For tomorrow, when the points are scored, we need to put everything together and manage degradation. We have carried out some good race simulations, it\u2019s a long season and tomorrow\u2019s race is just the first step.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Carlos Sainz of Spain driving the (55) Ferrari SF-23 on track during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

Last year the team found itself out of Q1 and now we are lining up fifth on the grid. Everyone in the team has done an amazing job and this is a strong baseline to build upon as we start the season. We shall see what tomorrow brings, but we have been competitive in all the sessions and we are starting close to the podium positions. If there is an opportunity there for the taking, then we will look to capitalise on it.\u201d Lance Stroll, 8th, 1:30.836 \u201cI am really happy with today\u2019s result. It shows the progress we have made as a team over the winter and that our hard work is paying off. From eighth we can race well and hopefully bring home some points tomorrow. I have spent the practice sessions doing my best to learn about the car, get up to speed, and find a rhythm as we built up to qualifying. I am really pleased with the performance I put in today and feeling grateful to be here just two weeks after my accident. I cannot wait to go racing tomorrow.\u201d Mike Krack, Team Principal \u201cTo get both cars through to Q3 in fifth and eighth is an excellent outcome from the first qualifying session of the year. I must say a big well done to the whole team \u2013 back at base and here at the track \u2013 for their constant hard work to get us to this point. The goal has been to take a step forward and our performance across today indicates we have done just that. We can race well from those grid positions and target scoring points with both cars. Huge credit to Lance for his performance today, especially given his situation, and having missed all of winter testing. His determination to get back in the car has been very impressive and he has done a super job to qualify in eighth. Fernando, too, delivered a strong performance tonight, with clean and tidy laps to take fifth, building on the speed we have shown during practice.

We don't know if we have the same race pace that we showed last year but I'm hoping we can be in the fight amongst the group behind Red Bull. It's really all going to depend on what our long-run pace is like. I am genuinely happy for Aston Martin. It's amazing to see their progress and the steps that they have taken. I am happy for Fernando as he's been here way longer than me so it's good to have him back in the mix! I'm sure we will have some good races.\" George Russell, 6th, 1:30.340 \"Today was a lot better than we expected, particularly after yesterday. We had a tough Friday; we expected to add a little bit of performance overnight, but we exceeded expectations. The changes we made we thought we might find a tenth, but we found close to five or six tenths, so we need to fully understand why that was. It's positive news but after FP3, we just focused on maximising performance. The car is feeling nice to drive so we are in a much better starting place than we were with the W13. We can now focus on adding global performance rather than problem solving. Tomorrow, we are in a good place to fight for third. Qualifying three tenths behind Ferrari when they have probably been the fastest car on single lap pace is positive. Fernando is probably more of a dark horse than Ferrari.\" Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport \"The gap to the very front isn't ridiculous considering we only ran one new soft tyre at the end of Q3. Nevertheless, it's not where we want to be and not what we had aimed for over the winter. We know what the gap is and what we need to find, or more, to win. Neither driver had a clean lap in the final run. There was probably another tenth-and-a-half still in there but it likely wouldn't have changed much. We maybe could have overtaken Alonso with both cars, but this is where we are. We are super critical of ourselves and what we need to achieve. There is no such thing as a sacred cow in our team, and we look at everything. The whole Team thinks like that, so we just need to get our heads together and work out the next steps from here. But first we race tomorrow - and we will be giving it everything we've got to move forward up the field.\" Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director \"Clearly, we're disappointed to be so far off pole, but we looked much further off yesterday. It's encouraging that the car responded to the overnight changes, and we've managed to improve a few of the issues like the high-speed cornering. Through the morning session the car was behaving quite predictably given the hotter conditions. There was a bit of fine-tuning going into qualifying and early on, it looked like we were in a pretty good place. As the sessions went on the others seemed to be finding a bit more pace. We also only had one set of tyres for the final part of Qualifying so that added up to leaving us with a gap that's bigger than we'd like but one that we'll be working hard to close down. Our straight-line speed looks strong, and our degradation seems to be in a reasonable place; the Red Bulls are out of reach from what we have seen but it would be good if we can get into a race with the Ferraris and Aston Martins.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W14 on track during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t quite feel at one with the car today and that meant we were way below where our true level is. There\u2019s a lot of work ahead of us to continue our understanding of the car and I\u2019m confident we will come back stronger for our next qualifying session. My focus is on tomorrow and I\u2019m really looking forward to the race and giving it my all.\u201d Alan Permane, Sporting Director \u201cOverall, we have mixed feelings after today\u2019s first Qualifying of the season with Esteban in ninth and Pierre in twentieth. In general, that\u2019s not where we aim to be, and we certainly have improvements to make to ensure we\u2019re qualifying in much stronger positions at later races. Pierre is certainly disappointed to be out in Q1. We have a lot to review on his side to understand what happened as clearly the car had much more pace than that. Esteban did a very good job and had three smooth sessions, though, looking at the timesheets, ninth place is probably where we deserve to be today. We\u2019re definitely ready for tomorrow\u2019s race as our high fuel running looked good in pre-season testing and in Free Practice 2 yesterday. Pierre can set his sights forward from the back of the grid as this race tends to have plenty of overtaking.

Nonetheless, it was a solid effort and with Zhou only 0.030s behind his team mate, it bodes well for a very close intra-team fight all season. If those two can keep pushing each other, points should follow. Valtteri Bottas, 12th, 1:31.443 \u201cIt was a straightforward qualifying session for us, and starting from P12 we will be definitely aiming for a place in the points. I\u2019m quite happy about the laps I delivered and it\u2019s good to see how Zhou was able to push me as well: we were just a bit short of Q3, but the midfield is really close and everything can still happen. From what we have seen in testing, we are not bad in race trim, and it will be interesting to see how tyre degradation will affect different cars: it\u2019s quite difficult to predict how the race will shape up, but we\u2019re going to give it our best shot.\u201d Zhou Guanyu, 13th, 1:31.473 \u201cEven from outside of the top 10, I feel we have the potential to gain a few positions during tomorrow\u2019s race: last year we were able to climb up the field, and I see no reason why we can\u2019t repeat what we have done before. It will be a tight fight, once again, and points are definitely the target. Looking at our performance from practice, we are in the mix for the top ten and it will often be a case of who can put everything together on the day: we went really close to it today, but ultimately fell a bit short. Still, there\u2019s everything to play for tomorrow and I\u2019m confident we can do a good job.\u201d Alessandro Alunni Bravi, Team Chief \u201cToday\u2019s result is a good first step and a platform on which we can build on to score points tomorrow.

We expected the midfield to be an incredibly tight affair, and tonight\u2019s result confirms just how close the battle will be. There are minimal gaps between all the cars around us and a single tenth can make the difference between quite a few positions: even though we missed out on Q3, we are still in the mix for the points. Our focus shifts to Sunday now: we need to prepare our best race plan, making sure we find a way to make the most of the good long-run pace we showed in testing and practice.

It\u2019s disappointing as, looking at the times in Q2, I really believe we could have made it to Q3. \u201cI\u2019m a bit disappointed after being P9 in Q1 and I feel like we deserved more than where we qualified but I think if you look at where we were this time last year and where we are at this year, apart from Aston Martin, we\u2019re the team that has made the biggest step forward. I\u2019m really proud of everyone at the team and at the factory and things are going in the right direction. \u201cWe really do come alive when the track becomes cold and I would say our race pace is stronger than our qualifying pace, so let\u2019s see what happens tomorrow.\u201d Dave Robson, Head of Vehicle Performance \u201cA frustrating result this evening but one that shows good promise. Logan was extremely unlucky not to get into Q2 having set the same lap time as Norris. Whilst Alex progressed to Q2 and was in a great position to set a good lap time, he had to abort his flying lap when an adjuster on his front wing failed, causing the flap to drop. Having completed so much running last week without an issue, it is frustrating to have it today in such an important session. \u201cWe can take a lot of positives from today as we look to translate the performance into a solid and forward-looking race plan. Both drivers know how to compile a strong race stint at this circuit, and everyone in Bahrain and in Grove are looking forward to helping them make good progress.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Logan Sargeant of United States driving the (2) Williams FW45 Mercedes in the Pitlane during final practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

In one of the biggest sagas of the summer, both McLaren and Alpine claimed they had the rights to Piastri's services, with the F1 Contract Recognition Board forced to mediate \u2013 eventually ruling in favour of McLaren, meaning the former F3 and F2 champ will be racing in papaya colours alongside Lando Norris this season.\n\nPiastri will drive for McLaren in 2023 after leaving Alpine\n\nPierre Gasly replaces Alonso... and Piastri With Piastri following Alonso out the exit door, Alpine sought to acquire Pierre Gasly\u2019s services from AlphaTauri (and Red Bull) for the 2023 season. A deal being struck meant that there will be two French drivers racing for the French team, with Gasly signing a multi-year contract to partner his childhood adversary Esteban Ocon this season. Nyck de Vries gets a full time race seat at AlphaTauri Gasly's departure created a vacancy at AlphaTauri, and there was one man who was making waves at the perfect time to grab it. Mercedes reserve driver Nyck de Vries had multiple FP1 outings in 2022 for a variety of teams \u2013 and then wowed the paddock with a fine P9 finish in his maiden Grand Prix when he stood in for Williams' Alex Albon at the Italian Grand Prix. The Dutchman was suddenly in demand, and soon sealed a deal to race alongside Yuki Tsunoda at AlphaTauri this year.

The eight-time Grand Prix winner lost his race seat at McLaren to compatriot Piastri, and opted against an immediate return to the grid with another team, instead choosing to take a break from competitive action for this year. That means this season he will be playing backup to former team mate Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez, at a team where he enjoyed plenty of success \u2013 winning seven races during his five-year spell in Milton Keynes.

He will partner his old rival Kevin Magnussen this year, after the American team opted not to extend the contract of Mick Schumacher.\n\nRicciardo returns to Red Bull as a reserve driver five seasons after leaving for Renault\n\nSchumacher takes up reserve role at Mercedes Haas\u2019 decision not to extend Schumacher\u2019s contract meant that the 2020 Formula 2 champion was left without a race seat for the 2023 season. Schumacher, however, will still be seen around the paddock this year, as he performs reserve driver duties at Mercedes, while plotting his route back to a full-time race seat.

The former Williams Academy driver took part in four FP1 sessions \u2013 in Austin, Mexico, Brazil, and Abu Dhabi \u2013 for the Grove outfit in 2022, and he will now become the first American F1 driver since Alexander Rossi in 2015.\n\nSargeant makes the step up to Williams for the 2023 season\n\n-- Team boss changes -- Vasseur replaces Binotto at Ferrari After months of speculation regarding his position, Mattia Binotto put an end to it all when he resigned as Team Principal of Ferrari in November, leaving the Scuderia searching for a replacement. They found that further down the pit lane at Alfa Romeo, with Frenchman Frederic Vassuer given the opportunity to take over the reins at Ferrari. ANALYSIS: How Team Principal Silly Season unfolded at Ferrari, Alfa Romeo and McLaren Sauber appoint Seidl CEO The Sauber Group \u2013 who run the Alfa Romeo F1 team \u2013 then moved swiftly to appoint former McLaren Team Principal Andreas Seidl as their new CEO. Seidl has strong ties to Audi \u2013 who will enter the sport as an engine manufacturer with Sauber in 2026 \u2013 having won the Le Mans 24 Hours three times with Porsche, with both brands owned by the Volkswagen group. Seidl will be assisted in running the team this year by Sauber Group Managing Director Alessandro Alunni Bravi, who has been given the additional role of \u2018Team Representative\u2019 for the 2023 F1 campaign.\n\nSeidl (L) is the new CEO of the Sauber Group while Vasseur (R) leaves Alfa Romeo for Ferrari\n\nMcLaren promote Stella Seidl\u2019s departure meant that McLaren were on the look out for a new leader on the pit wall. However, unlike their rivals, the Woking-based team opted to hire from within, with CEO Zak Brown making the decision to promote Executive Director of Racing Andrea Stella to the role of Team Principal.

After two seasons in charge of the Grove team, it was announced in December that Jost Capito would be leaving his role as Team Principal of Williams \u2013 after a season which saw them finish at the bottom of the championship standings with 8 points. Also leaving Williams alongside Capito was the Technical Director he had brought in, FX Demaison.\n\nJames Vowles leaves Mercedes to take up the Team Principal role at Mercedes",

            "text": "Nicholas Latifi\u2019s Williams seat is one of just two seats without a confirmed driver for the 2023 Formula 1 season. Could a dark horse candidate emerge and take it?\n\nThree more moves were recently confirmed for the 2023 Formula 1 season that had long been expected. Despite having Pierre Gasly under contract for next year, AlphaTauri were willing to let him leave for Alpine, provided they could find a viable replacement, and they did just that.\n\nMoments after Alpine officially confirmed Gasly as the replacement for the Aston Martin-bound Fernando Alonso alongside Esteban Ocon, AlphaTauri confirmed Nyck de Vries as Gasly\u2019s replacement alongside Yuki Tsunoda.\n\nThen earlier this week, Haas confirmed that Nico Hulkenberg is set to return to Formula 1 and replace Mick Schumacher alongside Kevin Magnussen.\n\nThese moves mean that there are 19 drivers confirmed on the 20-car grid for next season, leaving just Nicholas Latifi\u2019s Williams seat open alongside Alexander Albon.\n\nThis seat is guaranteed to see a change, as the team have already confirmed that Latifi will not be returning for a fourth year in 2023.\n\nWilliams junior and Formula 2 driver Logan Sargeant is set to take Latifi\u2019s seat, provided he can secure the necessary FIA Super License points with his finish in the Formula 2 standings.\n\nIt has long looked like Williams were waiting on Sargeant to make their decision, knowing that they weren\u2019t going to beat out Alpine and/or AlphaTauri to secure any of the other top talent on the market.\n\nDe Vries is one example, as he was seen as a potential Williams driver after making his Formula 1 debut with the team in Monza amid Albon\u2019s bout with appendicitis. He finished in ninth place and scored two points. Through the season\u2019s first 16 races, the Grove-based team had managed just four points total.\n\nTwo other options were obviously Daniel Ricciardo, who has lost his seat at McLaren to Alpine reserve driver Oscar Piastri, and Schumacher, who is officially out at Haas. The fact that at least one of these two drivers was likely always going to be available is another reason why Williams could afford to wait on Sargeant.\n\nBut is there a dark horse candidate whom we could be overlooking?\n\nWay back in early June, the plan was for Alpine to loan out Piastri to Williams to compete alongside Albon for 2023, as the Enstone outfit had been under the impression that Alonso was going to be returning for another year.\n\nSo when Alonso announced his move to Aston Martin alongside Lance Stroll as Sebastian Vettel\u2019s replacement, Alpine simply confirmed Piastri as his replacement. But by then, Piastri had already \u2014 legally \u2014 agreed to a contract with McLaren to replace Ricciardo.\n\nThat\u2019s where Alpine Academy and Formula 2 driver Jack Doohan could become part of the mix.\n\nConsidering the fact that Alpine were willing to loan Piastri to Williams to begin with and Williams are the only team left with an open seat for 2023, could they be willing to do the same with Doohan if Sargeant ends up being unable to secure his Super License?\n\nSargeant currently sits in third place in the standings while Doohan sits in a three-way tie for fourth, just nine points behind. Just 12 points blanket the drivers from third to seventh.\n\nSo nothing is guaranteed when it comes to Sargeant achieving the finish needed (either fifth or sixth, depending on his FP1 outing during Abu Dhabi Grand Prix weekend at Yas Marina Circuit) to secure the additional Super License points.
