We had a bit of a dip in form towards the end of last year in race pace and we carried that, let\u2019s say, \u2018difficult moment\u2019 into this year and we are exactly in the turning point, in the point of where we\u2019re trying to turn things around to make the car competitive again and to try and win again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy, there\u2019s another team called Red Bull that has killed everyone, the opposition, in a way, no?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not the only ones suffering it, there\u2019s teams also like Mercedes, that have suffered from their [Red Bull\u2019s] good job.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s down to us to revert it and to try our best to win again.\u201d",

Ryan Pierse // Getty Images\n\n\"In Austria, (Ferrari boss) Frederic Vasseur spoke to Alex Albon about 2025,\" the Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport reports.\n\n\n\nAnother possibility is that Red Bull might see Albon as a candidate to eventually replace Sergio Perez, despite the fact that it was Perez who replaced Albon at Red Bull after 2020.\n\n\n\nPerformance aside, the move to bring back Albon might also have the backing of Red Bull's upper brass, including the energy drink's new CEO, Oliver Mintzlaff.\n\n\n\n\"With every conversation I have with Mintzlaff, the situation becomes more positive and constructive,\" Marko, who initially clashed with Dietrich Mateschitz's successor, told Kronen Zeitung newspaper.\n\nRelated Story Three Saturday Night Races Spice 2024 F1 Calendar\n\nAlbon also has powerful Thai allies in the form of Chalerm Yoovidhya, heir to the late Thai billionaire whose family still controls 51% of the energy drink company. Yoovidhya was present at the recent Austrian GP at the Red Bull Ring.\n\n\n\n\"We are taking note of this increased presence very positively,\" Marko said.\n\n\n\nAnd he admits that could work in Albon's favor.\n\n\n\n\"Albon was always fast and he's in top form at the moment,\" said the 80-year-old Austrian.\n\n\n\nWhen asked if Albon is a candidate to return to Red Bull Racing, Marko smiled: \"We are always in contact with him.\"\n\nF1 British Grand Prix\n\nQualifying Results",

            "text": "There has been intense speculation about Leclerc\u2019s Ferrari future after his and the team\u2019s title challenge in 2022 fell apart.\n\nThe Scuderia\u2019s SF-23 package this year has been running well adrift of Red Bull\u2019s class leading RB19.\n\nDuring the early rounds of the season, Leclerc was linked with Mercedes as the German manufacturer is yet to sign Lewis Hamilton to a new deal alongside George Russell \u2013 talk that was quickly quashed by Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff.\n\nFerrari team principal Fred Vasseur also said back at the Australian Grand Prix in April that he was \u201cnot scared at all\u201d about the possibility of losing Leclerc post-2024 and that it was then \u201cnot the right moment\u201d to start negotiations about a possible extension.\n\nBut outside speculation has continued to mount about Leclerc\u2019s future with Ferrari after his recent qualifying problems in Spain and Canada.\n\nIn Montreal, the Monegasque driver openly criticised his team for its decision not to change to slicks early in the wet Q2 session where he was subsequently knocked out, but afterwards Vasseur insisted his driver had later said \u201cOk, I was wrong\u201d following internal discussions.\n\nAhead of the Austrian GP at the Red Bull Ring this weekend, Autosport asked Leclerc if he had begun talks about extending his new deal following his team-mate Carlos Sainz explaining he wanted his own Ferrari future sorted this winter and Leclerc replied: \u201cSlowly.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting slowly to speak about it, yes.\u201d\n\nCharles Leclerc, Ferrari SF-23 Photo by: Ferrari\n\nBut Leclerc said that unlike Sainz, he does not \u201chave any particular deadlines\u201d for doing a new deal with Ferrari as he feels \u201clike a year-and-a-half is a long way to go\u201d.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s not really on my mind yet,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen I say we slowly started talking about it, it\u2019s just here and there, but nothing special, nothing specific.\u201d\n\nShortly afterwards, Leclerc appeared to row back on his previous comments, saying the discussions he had had with Ferrari were \u201cjust jokes here and there \u2013 nothing formal or specific\u201d.\n\nThen, in response to a subsequent question asking if he would also be keeping his options to possibly move to another team in 2025 open, Leclerc insisted that \u201cI love Ferrari, so I\u2019m happy here\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying that [I want to keep my options open],\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cFerrari has been the team that has helped me to get to where I am. [I\u2019ve] never hidden that I\u2019ve always been extremely happy to be in Ferrari.\n\n\u201cOf course, the team and I are not happy with where we are at the moment, but I think we\u2019re all working in the right direction.\n\n\u201cAnd I am confident that we are working in the right direction. And, again, I love Ferrari, so I\u2019m happy here.\u201d\n\nRegarding media discussion on hypothetical moves to Mercedes or elsewhere in his F1 future, Leclerc acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s probably the first time in my career that I\u2019m in this position\u201d after his promotion from Ferrari junior entering F1 with Sauber in 2018 to the works squad the following year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think [that\u2019s] because nobody wanted me in the past, it\u2019s just because the nature of the contract it\u2019s the first time in my career that I actually get closer to a deal to end in Formula 1,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cAnd all of the other changes I\u2019ve made until now \u2013 basically Sauber to Ferrari was quite straightforward.\n\n\u201cSo, it is a different situation I find myself in in my career. But I don\u2019t mind \u2013 I\u2019m just focusing on driving, I just hope to win as quickly as possible in Ferrari for now and then we will see.\u201d",

The sight of the celebrations at the end of Sunday\u2019s endurance epic, the drivers posting about dreams come true, the headlines generated around the world, it\u2019s a snapshot of what a first Ferrari F1 title in nearly two decades could look and feel like.\n\nIt will inevitably lead to the likes of Leclerc and Carlos Sainz being asked about the potential of racing at Le Mans in future, but also about what\u2019s missing from the Scuderia at the moment as it chases F1 glory. There will be multiple answers to the second question, but in the form of the WEC set-up there are lessons that can be learned, and that\u2019s a good thing.\n\nBudget cap restrictions may have played their part in personnel needing reallocating,but no other team in F1 is competing in the top level of sportscars with its own prototype, and for simply being remotely competitive in both categories, Ferrari should be applauded \u2013 let alone winning the biggest endurance race of them all.",

F1 had long catered to rich older men. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why people want to get to the so-called &#8216;young generation&#8217;,&#8221; longtime F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone once said. &#8220;Most of these kids haven&#8217;t got any money. I&#8217;d rather get to the 70-year-old guy who&#8217;s got plenty of cash.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\tLiberty took a more egalitarian approach as it looked to raise F1&#8217;s profile in the U.S. and broaden the sport&#8217;s appeal. Drive to Survive opened F1 to a demographic that was both younger and more female, with women representing 40% of the viewing audience of the Netflix series. The Miami Grand Prix was added in 2022, and the inaugural Las Vegas race this fall is highly anticipated. The three U.S. races, including Austin, are more than any other country. Corporate America opened its eyes to the groundswell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\t&#8220;U.S. companies are generally the best at spending money in sports marketing, but they always looked at F1 as a European marketing initiative, which had its limitations,&#8221; Jefferson Slack, head of the commercial operations at Aston Martin, said in a phone interview. &#8220;Now they're not, and so they're piling in in a good way, which I think is driving a lot of the underlying values in the sport.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\tLawrence Stroll bought the Force India team in 2018 for $135 million and ultimately rebranded it as Aston Martin&#8212;only the 2020 acquisition of Williams for $180 million was a more recent control sale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\tBefore he invested, the Canadian billionaire was confident a spending cap was finally coming to F1. Stroll has poured money into building out the physical infrastructure of the team with a new factory and wind tunnel. Headcount has doubled to 800 employees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\tThe spending has produced results on and off the track. Fernando Alonso sits third in the driver standings, while the Aston Martin team is also third behind Red Bull and Mercedes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\tThe Aston Martin name resonates with marketers&#8212;thank you, James Bond. Sponsorship revenue has increased 1,000% since Stroll bought the team; it is expected to top $220 million this year led by Cognizant and Aramco. Aston Martin ranks fifth in Sportico&#8217;s valuations at $1.14 billion on revenue of nearly $250 million last year.</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\tF1 teams generated $300 million on average in 2022&#8212;only 10% below the NBA average&#8212;but their valuations significantly lag those in basketball and American football because profitability is much worse, even with the $140 million cost cap last year. Driver salaries, travel, marketing, legal and other costs are excluded from the cap. Aston Martin had an estimated cumulative operating loss of roughly $100 million over the past two years with its spending spree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\tThe result is F1 teams are valued at five times revenue on average, while NBA teams are at nine and climbing based on recent transactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\tThe profit picture is slowly improving under the cost caps. McLaren lost $137 million in 2018 but is expected to turn a profit this year. Mercedes turned the biggest operating profit last year at $114 million, but the only other teams to generate more than $10 million in income were Ferrari and Alpine, by Sportico&#8217;s estimates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\tTeams are pushing the limits on the cost cap. The FIA punished Red Bull last year for violations and the motorsport governing body is reviewing current team accounts from 2022, with any punishments expected later this year. F1 skeptics question whether teams will ever generate significant profits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\tThe cap was expected to level the playing field&#8212;or track, as it may&#8212;over time, with every team a contender in theory to start the season, as in the NFL. But there is a school of thought that the cap will prevent the bottom of the grid from ever catching up to the billions of dollars already invested in performance by the top teams, which gives them institutional advantages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\tAn alternative play to investing in individual teams is banking on Liberty&#8217;s operation of F1, which has been a home run so far. Liberty launched a tracking stock when it bought the race series, and the compounded annual rate of return is 23% through March, versus 6% for the S&amp;P Media Index and 10% for the S&amp;P 500.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\tLast year, F1 generated $2.6 billion in revenue, up 20%, and it is expected to increase 27% this year, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. Formula 1&#8217;s current enterprise value is $18.6 billion, including debt, and 20% higher than the combined value of the 10 teams. The stock trades at 7.2 times 2022 revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\t&#8220;One of the things that we at F1 with Liberty's help have been trying to do is build a mentality that I'll credit the NFL for, which is one league, that we benefit when everybody benefits,&#8221; Maffei said. \"Teams compete very hard on Sunday, but on Monday, we need to think about growing the entire ecosystem. It was critical that we have healthy teams so that we could have a healthy league.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"piano-related-story\"></p></div>",

I\u2019d rather get to the 70-year-old guy who\u2019s got plenty of cash.\u201d\n\nLiberty took a more egalitarian approach as it looked to raise F1\u2019s profile in the U.S. and broaden the sport\u2019s appeal. Drive to Survive opened F1 to a demographic that was both younger and more female, with women representing 40% of the viewing audience of the Netflix series. The Miami Grand Prix was added in 2022, and the inaugural Las Vegas race this fall is highly anticipated. The three U.S. races, including Austin, are more than any other country. Corporate America opened its eyes to the groundswell.\n\n\u201cU.S. companies are generally the best at spending money in sports marketing, but they always looked at F1 as a European marketing initiative, which had its limitations,\u201d Jefferson Slack, head of the commercial operations at Aston Martin, said in a phone interview. \u201cNow they're not, and so they're piling in in a good way, which I think is driving a lot of the underlying values in the sport.\u201d\n\nLawrence Stroll bought the Force India team in 2018 for $135 million and ultimately rebranded it as Aston Martin\u2014only the 2020 acquisition of Williams for $180 million was a more recent control sale.\n\nBefore he invested, the Canadian billionaire was confident a spending cap was finally coming to F1. Stroll has poured money into building out the physical infrastructure of the team with a new factory and wind tunnel. Headcount has doubled to 800 employees.\n\nThe spending has produced results on and off the track. Fernando Alonso sits third in the driver standings, while the Aston Martin team is also third behind Red Bull and Mercedes.\n\nThe Aston Martin name resonates with marketers\u2014thank you, James Bond. Sponsorship revenue has increased 1,000% since Stroll bought the team; it is expected to top $220 million this year led by Cognizant and Aramco. Aston Martin ranks fifth in Sportico\u2019s valuations at $1.14 billion on revenue of nearly $250 million last year.\n\nF1 teams generated $300 million on average in 2022\u2014only 10% below the NBA average\u2014but their valuations significantly lag those in basketball and American football because profitability is much worse, even with the $140 million cost cap last year. Driver salaries, travel, marketing, legal and other costs are excluded from the cap. Aston Martin had an estimated cumulative operating loss of roughly $100 million over the past two years with its spending spree.\n\nThe result is F1 teams are valued at five times revenue on average, while NBA teams are at nine and climbing based on recent transactions.\n\nThe profit picture is slowly improving under the cost caps. McLaren lost $137 million in 2018 but is expected to turn a profit this year. Mercedes turned the biggest operating profit last year at $114 million, but the only other teams to generate more than $10 million in income were Ferrari and Alpine, by Sportico\u2019s estimates.\n\nTeams are pushing the limits on the cost cap. The FIA punished Red Bull last year for violations and the motorsport governing body is reviewing current team accounts from 2022, with any punishments expected later this year. F1 skeptics question whether teams will ever generate significant profits.\n\nThe cap was expected to level the playing field\u2014or track, as it may\u2014over time, with every team a contender in theory to start the season, as in the NFL. But there is a school of thought that the cap will prevent the bottom of the grid from ever catching up to the billions of dollars already invested in performance by the top teams, which gives them institutional advantages.\n\nAn alternative play to investing in individual teams is banking on Liberty\u2019s operation of F1, which has been a home run so far. Liberty launched a tracking stock when it bought the race series, and the compounded annual rate of return is 23% through March, versus 6% for the S&P Media Index and 10% for the S&P 500.\n\nLast year, F1 generated $2.6 billion in revenue, up 20%, and it is expected to increase 27% this year, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Formula 1\u2019s current enterprise value is $18.6 billion, including debt, and 20% higher than the combined value of the 10 teams. The stock trades at 7.2 times 2022 revenue.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that we at F1 with Liberty's help have been trying to do is build a mentality that I'll credit the NFL for, which is one league, that we benefit when everybody benefits,\u201d Maffei said. \"Teams compete very hard on Sunday, but on Monday, we need to think about growing the entire ecosystem. It was critical that we have healthy teams so that we could have a healthy league.\u201d",

            "text": "Shubham Sangodkar\n\nSunday 9 July 2023 11:57 - Updated: 12:06\n\nAs the development war for the second best car in Formula 1 continues, Ferrari have brought a Red Bull-inspired beam wing concept to Silverstone which made their top speed as competitive as Red Bull themselves.\n\nTheir FP2 long runs and short runs looked competitive, and they clearly emerged as the second best team from Friday ahead of Mercedes, Aston Martin and McLaren. In fact, it looks like they might have closed the gap to Red Bull more than anyone expected. Don\u2019t take my word for it though, let's look at some data.\n\nFP2 Data: Race Trim\n\nThe long runs help to gauge the actual performance of the car, as these runs are normally done with DRS off. As such, they also provide a clean baseline as to what the real drag of the car is.\n\nThere are two main straights at Silverstone. The first one is the Wellington straight, which depends on your exit from the twisty section in Sector 1, and the second is the Hanger straight after the high-speed chicane Becketts. We will focus on the Hanger straight, as it gives a better idea about the top speed since it's less exit-dependent.\n\nComparing the Red Bull and Ferrari data, we can clearly see the supremacy of the the championship leaders around the high-speed sections of Copse, Maggots and Becketts \u2013 they're just in another league through this section with the fuel in the car.\n\nHowever, looking at the top speed data for the Hanger straight, we see that both Carlos Sainz Jr. and Max Verstappen clocked 301 km/h at the end of the straight, indicating a fundamental drag improvement of the car with DRS off.\n\nFP2 Data: Quali Trim\n\nThe short runs are done with DRS on in qualifying trim to gauge the balance of the car at low fuel and to optimise the battery deployment over the entire lap.\n\nIf we look at the telemetry plots of Sainz and Verstappen, again we see that both of them have a similar top speed of 325 km/h as compared to the rest of the field, who were around 320-322 km/h.

So it was very, very exciting. And I think the last time I went to see a race as a spectator was a very, very long time ago too.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The question for a Leclerc appearance at Le Mans is less a matter of &#8216;if&#8217; and more &#8216;when&#8217; it could happen.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With more and more races in Formula 1, it starts to become more and more difficult to fit another race in another category where you need to do testing, etc,&#8221; Leclerc admitted.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If the calendar lets me do it, why not? But at the moment, it looks difficult.&#8221;</p>\n\n<h3>THE RACE SAYS</h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-171385\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/the-race-com.appspot.com/1/2023/06/XPB_1212778_HiRes.jpg\" alt=\"Motor Racing Fia World Endurance Championship Wec Le Mans 24 Hours Race Le Mans, France\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\"></p>\n<p>It&#8217;d be great to see more F1 drivers appear at Le Mans eventually, and quite a lot do, but it&#8217;s a shame that it&#8217;s generally a postscript to their &#8216;main&#8217; career.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a good thing, for the most part. One of the great things about sportscar racing and especially the Le Mans challenge is it&#8217;s a different skillset, and at the same time extends the peak of a driver. It&#8217;s cool to see drivers who are in their late 30s or even in their early 40s continue to have success in races like Le Mans. Speed counts, but so does experience, and consistency, and intelligence. The driver who does the qualifying lap isn&#8217;t always the driver who then stars in the 3am in the middle of the race!</p>\n<p>But it would be amazing to see more drivers willing and able to dovetail a crack at Le Mans with F1 as Nico Hulkenberg and Fernando Alonso did in the 2010s. It&#8217;s immensely difficult, but doable.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-171380\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/the-race-com.appspot.com/1/2023/06/XPB_992440_HiRes-2.jpg\" alt=\"Motor Racing Le Mans 24 Hours Le Mans, France\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\"></p>\n<p>Leclerc wants to race there and you can bet he would love to do it with Ferrari if he can. Well, right now he has the option of doing that. This is a five-year hypercar project, for now, but we don&#8217;t know how Ferrari&#8217;s commitment may change. It might be five years and then never again or not again for another half century.

            "text": "Charles Leclerc has reiterated his desire to compete in the Le Mans 24 Hours and would be keen to dovetail the great endurance race with his Formula 1 career.\n\nLeclerc attended the French classic for the first time last weekend and watched his employer Ferrari win on its first top-class appearance at Le Mans in 50 years.\n\nThe five-time F1 grand prix winner spectated until the early hours of the morning, claiming he slept for \u201clike four hours\u201d overnight as he embraced the Le Mans experience \u2013 and has made it clear would relish the chance to go back as a driver.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible race,\u201d said Leclerc. \u201cAnd of course, I would love to participate one day. I don\u2019t know when, but I would love to.\n\n\u201cIt was the first time for me attending the race. Obviously it couldn\u2019t end up better with a Ferrari winning. But just the whole event is crazy.\n\nWinners and losers from Le Mans\u2019 2023 Hypercar thriller Read more\n\n\u201cBy night, the first six hours were crazy with the weather too, rain, no rain. So it was very, very exciting. And I think the last time I went to see a race as a spectator was a very, very long time ago too.\u201d\n\nThe question for a Leclerc appearance at Le Mans is less a matter of \u2018if\u2019 and more \u2018when\u2019 it could happen.\n\n\u201cWith more and more races in Formula 1, it starts to become more and more difficult to fit another race in another category where you need to do testing, etc,\u201d Leclerc admitted.\n\n\u201cIf the calendar lets me do it, why not? But at the moment, it looks difficult.\u201d\n\nTHE RACE SAYS\n\nIt\u2019d be great to see more F1 drivers appear at Le Mans eventually, and quite a lot do, but it\u2019s a shame that it\u2019s generally a postscript to their \u2018main\u2019 career.\n\nThat\u2019s a good thing, for the most part. One of the great things about sportscar racing and especially the Le Mans challenge is it\u2019s a different skillset, and at the same time extends the peak of a driver. It\u2019s cool to see drivers who are in their late 30s or even in their early 40s continue to have success in races like Le Mans. Speed counts, but so does experience, and consistency, and intelligence. The driver who does the qualifying lap isn\u2019t always the driver who then stars in the 3am in the middle of the race!\n\nBut it would be amazing to see more drivers willing and able to dovetail a crack at Le Mans with F1 as Nico Hulkenberg and Fernando Alonso did in the 2010s. It\u2019s immensely difficult, but doable.\n\nLeclerc wants to race there and you can bet he would love to do it with Ferrari if he can. Well, right now he has the option of doing that. This is a five-year hypercar project, for now, but we don\u2019t know how Ferrari\u2019s commitment may change. It might be five years and then never again or not again for another half century. Who knows when there will ever be a chance to see a top-line, peak Ferrari F1 driver race for the brand at Le Mans too?\n\nIf Leclerc really wants to do it, and he\u2019s lucky enough that the race itself doesn\u2019t clash with the F1 calendar, then everyone around him should move heaven and earth to make it happen.\n\nGiovinazzi\u2019s post-F1 redemption arc recalls prospect he once was Read more\n\nIf it comes later, with a different project, a lesser project, it would still be a great experience for him. But for racing fans in general a spectacle like Le Mans is only enhanced by the participation of quality, popular drivers.\n\nFor that reason alone, there should be every effort made from both camps \u2013 F1 and the World Endurance Championship \u2013 to make crossovers more feasible. If not for Leclerc then for any driver who shares his ambition and curiosity in the future.\n\nF1 is pushing for a consistent schedule of 24 races for the foreseeable future and although it is a priority for F1 and WEC organisers to keep grands prix and Le Mans separate, Leclerc is right to point out that other commitments in the build-up to Le Mans are trickier to plan around.\n\nFor instance, while Le Mans did not clash with an F1 race this year, the preceding WEC round at Spa was on the same weekend as Azerbaijan \u2013 and more importantly, the Le Mans test day took place on the weekend of the Spanish Grand Prix.\n\nThat\u2019s why it is most common to see ex-F1 drivers compete in the race, often alongside a full sportscar racing programme, once their grand prix career ends.\n\nFerrari\u2019s winning line-up this year included ex-F1 driver Antonio Giovinazzi, while Toyota pair Sebastien Buemi and Brendon Hartley (both ex-Toro Rosso drivers in F1) won in 2022.\n\nBack at its best or contrived? Our Le Mans 24 Hours verdict Read more\n\nIn fact, the last six winning cars have featured ex-F1 drivers \u2013 Kamui Kobayashi was a winner in 2021, while Buemi and Hartley won alongside another ex-F1 driver Kazuki Nakajima in 2020.\n\nThat win with Hartley actually completed a hat-trick of consecutive Le Mans wins for Buemi and Nakajima, as they were joined by Alonso for their victories in 2018 and 2019.\n\nActive F1 drivers contesting Le Mans, let alone winning it, is a rarer sight.

            "article_html": "<div><p>The 2023 British Grand Prix delivered the drama as Red Bull's Max Verstappen took his sixth race victory in succession.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>The Dutchman claimed top spot at this race for the first time in his career as his team made it 11 wins in a row - a joint record in the sport alongside McLaren.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>From the off he was put under heavy pressure though as Lando Norris gained the lead of the Grand Prix off the line much to the delight of the Silverstone capacity crowd. The home favourite then held out for a number of laps before Verstappen ultimately retook the lead and took the chequered flag.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>Norris himself equalled his best ever result by coming home in P2, whilst Lewis Hamilton rounded out the podium places after he benefitted from a late safety car stoppage. That was Hamilton's 14th podium finish at the British Grand Prix, the most of any driver at any track in the sport's history and it also made it two British drivers on the podium at Silverstone for the first time since 1999.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>Australian rookie and Norris' McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri finished in P4, his best race result to date as he continues to impress during his debut F1 campaign.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>George Russell, Sergio Perez, Fernando Alonso, Alex Albon, Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz all finished in the points as Silverstone delivered its usual excitement.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>MORE:&#160;<a href=\"https://www.sportingnews.com/uk/formula-1/news/f1-british-grand-prix-2023-predictions-odds-betting-tips/bbax6pf1sftgoq7vc98nore6\">F1 British Grand Prix predictions, odds, betting tips, best bets for 2023 race at Silverstone</a></strong></p>\n\n<h2>F1 2023 British Grand Prix results</h2>\n\n\n\n\n\t<strong>Position</strong>\n\t<strong>Driver</strong>\n\t<strong>Team</strong>\n\t<strong>Points</strong>\n\n\n\t<strong>1</strong>\n\tMax Verstappen\n\tRed Bull\n\t26\n\n\n\t<strong>2</strong>\n\tLando Norris\n\tMcLaren\n\t18\n\n\n\t<strong>3</strong>\n\tLewis Hamilton\n\tMercedes\n\t15\n\n\n\t<strong>4</strong>\n\tOscar Piastri\n\tMcLaren\n\t12\n\n\n\t<strong>5</strong>\n\tGeorge Russell\n\tMercedes\n\t10\n\n\n\t<strong>6</strong>\n\tSergio Perez\n\tRed Bull\n\t8\n\n\n\t<strong>7</strong>\n\tFernando Alonso\n\tAston Martin\n\t6\n\n\n\t<strong>8</strong>\n\tAlex Albon\n\tWilliams\n\t5\n\n\n\t<strong>9</strong>\n\tCharles Leclerc\n\tFerrari\n\t2\n\n\n\t<strong>10</strong>\n\tCarlos Sainz\n\tFerrari\n\t1\n\n\n\t<strong>11</strong>\n\tLogan Sargeant\n\tWilliams\n\t-\n\n\n\t<strong>12</strong>\n\tValtteri Bottas\n\tAlfa Romeo\n\t-\n\n\n\t<strong>13</strong>\n\tNico Hulkenberg\n\tHaas\n\t-\n\n\n\t<strong>14</strong>\n\tLance Stroll\n\tAston Martin\n\t-\n\n\n\t<b>15</b>\n\tZhou Guanyu\n\tAlfa Romeo\n\t-\n\n\n\t<b>16</b>\n\tYuki Tsunoda\n\tAlphaTauri\n\t-\n\n\n\t<b>17</b>\n\tNyck De Vries\n\tAlphaTauri\n\t-\n\n\n\t<b>DNF</b>\n\tPierre Gasly&#160;\n\tAlpine\n\t-\n\n\n\t<b>DNF</b>\n\tKevin Magnussen\n\tHaas\n\t-\n\n\n\t<b>DNF</b>\n\tEsteban Ocon\n\tAlpine\n\t-\n\n\n\n\n<h2>F1 British Grand Prix 2023 live updates, highlights: As it happens</h2>\n\n<p><strong>CHEQUERED FLAG:</strong>&#160;<strong>MAX VERSTAPPEN WINS THE 2023 BRITISH GRAND PRIX!!&#160;</strong>It's a sixth straight victory for the Red Bull driver who continues to close in on a third World Drivers' Championship title. British favourites Lando Norris and Lewis Hamilton round out the podium places.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 50:</strong>&#160;Two laps to go then and Verstappen is causing to a sixth straight victory with the added bonus of claiming the fastest lap. Norris is looking good for P2 whilst Hamilton looks likely to claim the final podium spot.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 48:</strong> Replays show that Stroll crashed into Gasly causing his damage. Not a neat move from the Canadian at all.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 46:</strong>&#160;In what could prove to be absolutely crucial, Norris breaks the DRS gap to Hamilton and he hunts down a P2 finish. Hamilton's used soft tyres seem to be struggling a bit now, could Piastri challenge him near the end of this race?&#160;</p>\n\n<p>Gasly is out of this race. It's a double DNF for Alpine at Silverstone!&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 44:</strong>&#160;It's a simply perfect move from Perez on Sainz. He produces the switch back and gets through. It goes from bad to even worse for Sainz on the same lap as both Albon and Leclerc pass him as well!&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 42:</strong>&#160;It's still Norris from Hamilton behind Verstappen in the battle for P2. The veteran is piling the pressure on now though, as too is his teammate Russell just behind in his fight to overtake Piastri.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 40:&#160;</strong>It's yet more stunning defence from Norris who blocks Hamilton perfectly. The crowd are absolutely loving this. DRS is now activated.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 39: </strong>We're back under green flag conditions and away we go! Verstappen gets away quickly but Norris and Hamilton are having a battle for the ages. The Mercedes man tries it round the outside down the back straight but Norris is having none of it.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>SAFETY CAR:</strong>&#160;The camera cuts to the back straight and Magnussen's Haas car is on fire. It's a huge engine problem for the Danish driver! That could have come at the perfect time for Verstappen and Norris who will pit and save plenty of time. Race on!</p>\n\n<p>Hamilton is promoted up to P3 on used soft tyres at the expense of Piastri, Norris chooses the hards. Very interesting selections going on here.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 32:</strong>&#160;Russell overtakes Leclerc round the outside of Luffield. That was a lovely move and the British driver gives a hefty round of applause for his good work. Gasly pits which promotes Piastri up to P5.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>Still no pits for Verstappen and Norris..&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 30:</strong>&#160;The flurry of pit stops begin, starting with Russell and crucially he rejoins behind Leclerc which he won't be happy with.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>Piastri responds and it's a quick stop from the McLaren team. He comes back out well ahead of Leclerc.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 27:</strong>&#160;Ferrari must have heard me.. Sainz pits for his own set of hard tyres. Expect the Mercedes duo, amongst others, to respond shortly.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 26:</strong>&#160;The top order are seriously pushing their first set of tyres here as they wait to see if any rain will fall. Only Leclerc has pit from the top order, he gets past Stroll to jump into P11.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 23:</strong>&#160;Verstappen's lead in now up to 5.5 seconds. It's his to lose from here.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 21:</strong>&#160;Despite starting on soft tyres, Russell is still out there for now. A number of others have pit but he continues for the time being.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>Looking at how dark the skies are, expect rain sometime soon..&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 19:</strong>&#160;Leclerc pits! Under heavy pressure from Russell behind, the Ferrari man boxes for a set of hard tyres. That leaves their options open in terms of going to the end of this race if the weather allows.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 17:</strong>&#160;After his stunning P3 qualification finish yesterday, Piastri is putting together a lovely race performance here. Leclerc behind in P4 is now over four seconds adrift as the McLaren pair look to save their tyres for a while.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 15</strong>: Perez gets past Stroll to grab P11 as his recovery drive gets underway. The two Aston Martin's are struggling out there today.&#160;</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">LAP 12/52<br>\n<br>\nPerez sparkles his way past Stroll to move into P11, up five places from his starting slot<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BritishGP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BritishGP</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/F1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#F1</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/yJkfrTFVyY\">pic.twitter.com/yJkfrTFVyY</a></p>\n&#8212; Formula 1 (@F1) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/F1/status/1678047460344856576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 9, 2023</a></blockquote>\n \n\n<p><strong>Lap 13:</strong>&#160;We've now got the classic situation of some teams saying rain is guaranteed whilst others are claiming that it'll miss the track. We'll see..</p>\n\n<p>Russell would benefit more than anyone else out there as he's the only driver in the top ten who started this race on soft tyres rather than mediums.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 11:</strong>&#160;Early reports of rain down at the Luffield corner. That could make this race even more interesting!&#160;</p>\n\n<p>Ocon becomes the first driver to retire from this race.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 9:</strong>&#160;Norris has just dropped out of Verstappen's DRS zone which could leave him susceptible to his teammate behind. Leclerc will also look to close the 3.5 second gap behind too.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 7:</strong>&#160;There's some stunning battles going on here. Verstappen and Norris followed by Piastri out front, Leclerc and Russell just behind and then old rivals Alonso and Hamilton for P7. This is scintillating stuff!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 5:</strong>&#160;Verstappen gets past Norris and retakes the lead of the British Grand Prix!! The pressure had been building on the Brit but he remains close behind the Flying Dutchman. Piastri currently still occupies P3 ahead of Leclerc and Russell.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lap 3:</strong>&#160;It's still Norris who leads here at Silverstone and Verstappen will get the DRS benefit soon. That could be crucial in the battle between the pair.&#160;</p>\n\n \n \n\n<p>It's less than ideal for Hamilton who lost a place on the opening lap whilst Russell jumped Sainz.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>LIGHTS OUT:</strong>&#160;It's away we go at the Silverstone and Norris leads the British Grand Prix!!! It's a stunning start for the Brit in his McLaren and the crowd goes absolutely wild. The Dutchman is now under pressure from Piastri but he holds off the Australian rookie for now.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong>2 minutes to lights out:</strong>&#160;We're off for the formation lap ahead of the 2023 British Grand Prix.</p>\n\n<p><strong>15 minutes to lights out:</strong>&#160;The drivers are now heading to the front of the grid for the national anthem.

            "text": "The 2023 British Grand Prix delivered the drama as Red Bull's Max Verstappen took his sixth race victory in succession.\n\nThe Dutchman claimed top spot at this race for the first time in his career as his team made it 11 wins in a row - a joint record in the sport alongside McLaren.\n\nFrom the off he was put under heavy pressure though as Lando Norris gained the lead of the Grand Prix off the line much to the delight of the Silverstone capacity crowd. The home favourite then held out for a number of laps before Verstappen ultimately retook the lead and took the chequered flag.\n\nNorris himself equalled his best ever result by coming home in P2, whilst Lewis Hamilton rounded out the podium places after he benefitted from a late safety car stoppage. That was Hamilton's 14th podium finish at the British Grand Prix, the most of any driver at any track in the sport's history and it also made it two British drivers on the podium at Silverstone for the first time since 1999.\n\nAustralian rookie and Norris' McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri finished in P4, his best race result to date as he continues to impress during his debut F1 campaign.\n\nGeorge Russell, Sergio Perez, Fernando Alonso, Alex Albon, Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz all finished in the points as Silverstone delivered its usual excitement.\n\nMORE: F1 British Grand Prix predictions, odds, betting tips, best bets for 2023 race at Silverstone\n\nF1 2023 British Grand Prix results\n\nPosition Driver Team Points 1 Max Verstappen Red Bull 26 2 Lando Norris McLaren 18 3 Lewis Hamilton Mercedes 15 4 Oscar Piastri McLaren 12 5 George Russell Mercedes 10 6 Sergio Perez Red Bull 8 7 Fernando Alonso Aston Martin 6 8 Alex Albon Williams 5 9 Charles Leclerc Ferrari 2 10 Carlos Sainz Ferrari 1 11 Logan Sargeant Williams - 12 Valtteri Bottas Alfa Romeo - 13 Nico Hulkenberg Haas - 14 Lance Stroll Aston Martin - 15 Zhou Guanyu Alfa Romeo - 16 Yuki Tsunoda AlphaTauri - 17 Nyck De Vries AlphaTauri - DNF Pierre Gasly Alpine - DNF Kevin Magnussen Haas - DNF Esteban Ocon Alpine -\n\nF1 British Grand Prix 2023 live updates, highlights: As it happens\n\nCHEQUERED FLAG: MAX VERSTAPPEN WINS THE 2023 BRITISH GRAND PRIX!! It's a sixth straight victory for the Red Bull driver who continues to close in on a third World Drivers' Championship title. British favourites Lando Norris and Lewis Hamilton round out the podium places.\n\nLap 50: Two laps to go then and Verstappen is causing to a sixth straight victory with the added bonus of claiming the fastest lap. Norris is looking good for P2 whilst Hamilton looks likely to claim the final podium spot.\n\nLap 48: Replays show that Stroll crashed into Gasly causing his damage. Not a neat move from the Canadian at all.\n\nLap 46: In what could prove to be absolutely crucial, Norris breaks the DRS gap to Hamilton and he hunts down a P2 finish. Hamilton's used soft tyres seem to be struggling a bit now, could Piastri challenge him near the end of this race?\n\nGasly is out of this race. It's a double DNF for Alpine at Silverstone!\n\nLap 44: It's a simply perfect move from Perez on Sainz. He produces the switch back and gets through. It goes from bad to even worse for Sainz on the same lap as both Albon and Leclerc pass him as well!\n\nLap 42: It's still Norris from Hamilton behind Verstappen in the battle for P2. The veteran is piling the pressure on now though, as too is his teammate Russell just behind in his fight to overtake Piastri.\n\nLap 40: It's yet more stunning defence from Norris who blocks Hamilton perfectly. The crowd are absolutely loving this. DRS is now activated.\n\nLap 39: We're back under green flag conditions and away we go! Verstappen gets away quickly but Norris and Hamilton are having a battle for the ages. The Mercedes man tries it round the outside down the back straight but Norris is having none of it.\n\nSAFETY CAR: The camera cuts to the back straight and Magnussen's Haas car is on fire. It's a huge engine problem for the Danish driver! That could have come at the perfect time for Verstappen and Norris who will pit and save plenty of time. Race on!\n\nHamilton is promoted up to P3 on used soft tyres at the expense of Piastri, Norris chooses the hards. Very interesting selections going on here.\n\nLap 32: Russell overtakes Leclerc round the outside of Luffield. That was a lovely move and the British driver gives a hefty round of applause for his good work. Gasly pits which promotes Piastri up to P5.\n\nStill no pits for Verstappen and Norris..\n\nLap 30: The flurry of pit stops begin, starting with Russell and crucially he rejoins behind Leclerc which he won't be happy with.\n\nPiastri responds and it's a quick stop from the McLaren team. He comes back out well ahead of Leclerc.\n\nLap 27: Ferrari must have heard me.. Sainz pits for his own set of hard tyres. Expect the Mercedes duo, amongst others, to respond shortly.\n\nLap 26: The top order are seriously pushing their first set of tyres here as they wait to see if any rain will fall. Only Leclerc has pit from the top order, he gets past Stroll to jump into P11.\n\nLap 23: Verstappen's lead in now up to 5.5 seconds. It's his to lose from here.\n\nLap 21: Despite starting on soft tyres, Russell is still out there for now. A number of others have pit but he continues for the time being.\n\nLooking at how dark the skies are, expect rain sometime soon..\n\nLap 19: Leclerc pits! Under heavy pressure from Russell behind, the Ferrari man boxes for a set of hard tyres. That leaves their options open in terms of going to the end of this race if the weather allows.\n\nLap 17: After his stunning P3 qualification finish yesterday, Piastri is putting together a lovely race performance here. Leclerc behind in P4 is now over four seconds adrift as the McLaren pair look to save their tyres for a while.\n\nLap 15: Perez gets past Stroll to grab P11 as his recovery drive gets underway. The two Aston Martin's are struggling out there today.\n\nLAP 12/52\n\n\n\nPerez sparkles his way past Stroll to move into P11, up five places from his starting slot#BritishGP #F1 pic.twitter.com/yJkfrTFVyY \u2014 Formula 1 (@F1) July 9, 2023\n\nLap 13: We've now got the classic situation of some teams saying rain is guaranteed whilst others are claiming that it'll miss the track. We'll see..\n\nRussell would benefit more than anyone else out there as he's the only driver in the top ten who started this race on soft tyres rather than mediums.\n\nLap 11: Early reports of rain down at the Luffield corner. That could make this race even more interesting!\n\nOcon becomes the first driver to retire from this race.\n\nLap 9: Norris has just dropped out of Verstappen's DRS zone which could leave him susceptible to his teammate behind. Leclerc will also look to close the 3.5 second gap behind too.\n\nLap 7: There's some stunning battles going on here. Verstappen and Norris followed by Piastri out front, Leclerc and Russell just behind and then old rivals Alonso and Hamilton for P7. This is scintillating stuff!\n\nLap 5: Verstappen gets past Norris and retakes the lead of the British Grand Prix!! The pressure had been building on the Brit but he remains close behind the Flying Dutchman. Piastri currently still occupies P3 ahead of Leclerc and Russell.\n\nLap 3: It's still Norris who leads here at Silverstone and Verstappen will get the DRS benefit soon. That could be crucial in the battle between the pair.\n\nIt's less than ideal for Hamilton who lost a place on the opening lap whilst Russell jumped Sainz.\n\nLIGHTS OUT: It's away we go at the Silverstone and Norris leads the British Grand Prix!!! It's a stunning start for the Brit in his McLaren and the crowd goes absolutely wild. The Dutchman is now under pressure from Piastri but he holds off the Australian rookie for now.\n\n2 minutes to lights out: We're off for the formation lap ahead of the 2023 British Grand Prix.\n\n15 minutes to lights out: The drivers are now heading to the front of the grid for the national anthem.

Charles Leclerc, while speaking to the media post the qualifying session, revealed that he is aiming for a second-place finish at Silverstone.</p>\n<p class=\"ad-declare-explicit\"></p>\n\n<blockquote>\"The goal for tomorrow is second place. We know that Mercedes is strong in long runs. There are question marks on McLaren.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The car was second-fastest during the qualifying session yesterday, as both drivers placed themselves right behind the Red Bull of Max Verstappen. However, a surprise performance from McLaren, as mentioned previously, shifted them down.

Team orders went to and fro for the drivers as the qualifying got more and more intense.\n\nOne instance was when Leclerc and other drivers had lined up for their hotlaps, as Sainz overtook his teammate to start the lap first. The former complained about it on the radio in a rather sarcastic tone.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"Nice Carlos, nice. Good overtake in last corner.\"\n\nHere is the video of the incident that Formula 1 uploaded later.\n\nLikewise, when Carlos Sainz, who went out of the garage first, was asked to let Charles Leclerc through for the lap, letting him go earlier. Although Sainz gave him the space, respecting the team's orders, he did mention to his engineer that it was unfair given the fact that Leclerc was in a safer place for qualifying compared to him.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"It's a bit unfair what you're asking me to do there, sacrifice my tyre temperature. But anyway, whatever. Also, I am P4 and he's P3, I am more at risk.\"\n\nBoth drivers did not face many issues during the qualifying, however. Charles Leclerc qualified P4, followed by Sainz at P5, right behind the McLarens, who qualified astonishingly well.\n\nCharles Leclerc aiming for a P2 finish at Silverstone\n\nFerrari has been aiming for second place this season since Red Bull's domination flourished over the grid. However, that quite hasn't been achieved, as the team has been on the podium only twice.\n\nUpgrades have been brought on the car that has helped them get more competitive and perhaps challenge the Red Bull of Max Verstappen, but that still remains a little difficult. Charles Leclerc, while speaking to the media post the qualifying session, revealed that he is aiming for a second-place finish at Silverstone.\n\n\"The goal for tomorrow is second place. We know that Mercedes is strong in long runs. There are question marks on McLaren.\"\n\nThe car was second-fastest during the qualifying session yesterday, as both drivers placed themselves right behind the Red Bull of Max Verstappen. However, a surprise performance from McLaren, as mentioned previously, shifted them down. Even Charles Leclerc remarked that those cars will be the ones to target during the race.\n\nAt the same time, Mercedes could be making a return to the front of the grid with their race pace after qualifying behind the Ferraris.\n\nPoll : 0 votes",

But the car was a rocket ship in Q2 and Q3 and it felt like I put a pretty good lap together.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a massive result for the team as well. To have both of us up here is a mega result and we have got to try and stay there for tomorrow.\u201d\n\nFormer world champion Jenson Button was full of praise for Piastri, saying he\u2019s driving with great confidence despite his newness to the sport.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he feels any pressure on his shoulders,\u201d he said on Sky Sports.\n\n\u201cHe had a good start to his year and the team can see his pace, so he doesn\u2019t feel the pressure so much at the moment.\n\n\u201cYou can see it in his confidence and driving and that\u2019s what a driver needs when they are new to the sport.\u201d\n\nSky Sports\u2019 Sam Johnston wrote: \u201cFor Piastri, who had to wait until this weekend to get his chance to use the upgrades, it was a performance that confirmed the special talent that the sport has been expecting from the Australian since his controversial move to McLaren last summer.\u201d\n\nMcLaren claimed their first front row start at their home British Grand Prix since 2008 through Norris with his teammate Australian rookie Oscar Piastri taking third behind him ahead of both Ferraris.\n\n\u201cThis is a team without a podium at Silverstone for 13 years,\u201d Sky Sports F1 analyst David Croft said.\n\n\u201cThis is a team that has put their cars second and third on the grid for tomorrow\u2019s British GP.\n\n\u201cThey have got professor Brian Cox as their guest today but that is a superstellar stratospheric, out of this universe performance in Qualifying.\u201d\n\nFormer world champion Jenson Button said on Sky Sports the result was a \u201cmassive shock\u201d. \u201cYou look at the times yesterday they didn\u2019t seem that competitive,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut every session in qualifying there were there, both cars very quick and both of them are up in the top three.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s so close as well. Two and a half tenths to Max which we might expect but the top seven is under half a second.\u201d\n\nPiastri in the wet of practice before qualifying got underway. Source: Getty Images\n\nVerstappen added that the changing conditions had been a challenge \u201cespecially in Q1 and Q2 and there were a few little damp spots so we had to be a bit careful in Q3.\n\n\u201cOf course, you push close to the limit, but obviously we have a quick car so we didn\u2019t need to go to 100 per cent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a very big gap today, but for us it has been a great day and I am looking forward to the race already.\u201d\n\nVerstappen\u2019s pole was his fifth in succession, his seventh of the season and the 27th of his career as he leads Red Bull\u2019s bid for a record-equalling 11th consecutive race victory, drawing level with McLaren\u2019s 1988 achievement.\n\nPiastri was third fastest ahead of the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz and the Mercedes of George Russell and seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton.\n\nAs Verstappen celebrated, his Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez and nearest championship rival, who trails him by 81 points in the drivers\u2019 title race, suffered a fifth early exit this season, this time from Q1.\n\nWatch the Formula 1 British Grand Prix 2023 live and ad-break free in racing on Kayo Sports on Monday, 10 July, at 12:00am AEST.

Pretty insane! My last lap was a good lap.\n\n\u201cI could hear Zak (team boss, Zak Brown) on the radio on the last lap.

Ninth is Fernando Alonso\u2019s equal worst qualifying position and will give him his outright worst grid spot for 2023.\n\nHe\u2019s not just back behind the factory Mercedes team, he\u2019s also behind the superb Alex Albon too, and we\u2019ve learnt from so many races that the Thai driver is a ferocious defender.\n\n\u201cIt was not a good day obviously,\u201d Alonso told Sky Sports. \u201cNothing we can do now. Let\u2019s hope for a better race tomorrow and to score some good points.\n\n\u201cIt seems like we have to have to be on a defensive strategy this weekend.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first substandard weekend Aston Martin has had this year, but it certainly feels like the team has lost a little bit of the initiative it burst from the blocks with. Just a tiny bit of air has escaped the balloon \u2014 certainly if McLaren has made a genuine jump forward.\n\nIt\u2019s come as Ferrari, Mercedes and now McLaren have all brought big upgrades.\n\n\u201cSome of our competition really improved the car and brought a lot of new parts. That\u2019s one reason,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cThe second reason is track specific.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t perform in Barcelona, Austria and Silverstone. All three of them are a little bit similar in terms of track characteristics.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT?\n\nPre-race coverage starts at 10:30pm Sunday, with lights out for the British Grand Prix at midnight Monday morning.\n\n",

            "article_html": "<div><p>Formula 1 returns to Silverstone to celebrate 70 years since its first World Championship race this weekend. The circuit has hosted many a grand prix thriller through the years &#8212;&#8230;</p><p>The country&#8217;s leading motor sport event is likely to be an irresistible target for Just Stop Oil activists, who <a href=\"https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/database/races/2022-british-grand-prix/\">invaded the circuit in 2022</a>, and have already disrupted Wimbledon and the World Snooker Championship this year. &#8220;There is possibly quite a high chance of something happening this weekend,&#8221; said Williams&#8217; <a href=\"https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/database/drivers/alexander-albon\">Alex Albon</a> ahead of the race.</p>\n<p>Silverstone has recruited 100 extra marshals this weekend, partly to deal with the threat, but the difficulties of securing the circuit are obvious, with a capacity crowd expected on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Last year&#8217;s protest was far from the first time that individuals have risked their lives alongside F1 cars, although the motivations and actions vary considerably. Scroll down for a rundown of previous grand prix track invasions.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><strong>2022 British Grand Prix track invasion</strong></h3>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The protesters at the start of the GP. So crazy to see cars going by, so lucky we had the red flag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/f1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#f1</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BritishGP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BritishGP</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BritishGrandPrix?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BritishGrandPrix</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BritishGrandPrix2022?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BritishGrandPrix2022</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SilverstoneGP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SilverstoneGP</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/gVNq2LCVbT\">pic.twitter.com/gVNq2LCVbT</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; F1YEZ &#127937; (@F1YEZ_official) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/F1YEZ_official/status/1543643256998723584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 3, 2022</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Last year saw the most recent example of a track invasion at the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. Six climate protestors made their way on to the Wellington Straight during the opening lap of the race and sat down on the track, hoping to disrupt the start.</p>\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/articles/single-seaters/f1/huge-zhou-shunt-brings-out-red-flag-at-british-gp-on-first-lap/\">Zhou Guanyu&#8217;s enormous crash</a> into Turn 1 brought out a safety car which slowed the grid before they reached the protestors, allowing marshals to drag the protestors off track in time. The alternative &#8212; of protestors on track as cars accelerated to 200mph &#8212; could have been disastrous.</p>\n<p>The Just Stop Oil group has disrupted several high-profile events this year and Silverstone is anticipating a stunt at this year&#8217;s race.The circuit&#8217;s managing director Stuart Pringle has confirmed that there are extra plans in place to deter intruders.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><strong>2015 Chinese Grand Prix- FP2 track invasion</strong></h3>\n<p>Perhaps the most bizarre example of a track invasion occurred during the second practice session of the <a href=\"https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/articles/single-seaters/f1/2015-chinese-gp-report/\">Chinese Grand Prix in 2015</a>. A local fan ran across the pit straight before jumping over the barrier into the pitlane and approaching the <a href=\"https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/database/teams/ferrari\">Ferrari</a> garage. Reports say that he entered the garage waving his grandstand ticket, believing that he had paid for a go in an F1 car and that the Ferrari was his pick of the bunch. He was promptly detained by security and was unsurprisingly denied a test drive in his dream Ferrari.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><strong>2015 Singapore Grand Prix track invasion</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img height=\"450\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Sebastian Vettel in 2015 SIngapore GP\" src=\"\">\n\n\n\n<img height=\"450\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Sebastian Vettel in 2015 SIngapore GP\" src=\"https://motorsportmagazine.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Sebastian-Vettel-in-2015-SIngapore-GP-800x450.jpg\">\n\n\n \n\n<p>2015 saw not one but two incidents of people making their way on to the track. After the the incident in Shanghai, another spectator decided to take a wander along the edge of the track during the <a href=\"https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/articles/single-seaters/f1/2015-singapore-gp-report/\">Singapore Grand Prix later that year</a>. Yogvatim Pravin Dhokia jumped over a barrier on the approach to turn 13 before running across the track in front of Sebastian Vettel whose Ferrari was barrelling towards him at 180 mph.</p>\n<p>Dhokia made it across uninjured before walking further along the Marina Bay track and finding a gap in the fence and making his exit. His excursion brought out a safety car and Dhokia was promptly arrested and charged for disrupting the event.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><strong>2004 Spanish Grand Prix track invasion</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"video-embed\"></p>\n<p>Not all track invaders take their cause quite so seriously, as was the case with serial sports disruptor &#8216;Jimmy Jump&#8217; who ran onto the circuit during the formation lap for the 2004 Spanish Grand Prix. Jimmy, real name Jaume Marquet i Cot, made a habit of disrupting sporting events in the early 2000s, including tennis matches and even the 2010 World Cup final. His unwanted appearance on the Catalunya circuit was swiftly ended by the trackside marshals allowing the race to start uninterrupted.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><strong>2003 British Grand Prix track invasion</strong></h3>\n<p>One of the best-remembered F1 track invasions came in 2003, with that year&#8217;s British Grand Prix being disrupted by the laicised priest Neil Horan. Horan managed to enter onto Silverstone&#8217;s Hangar straight, dressed in a kilt and adorned in a religious banner. Unlike Sehli three years earlier, Horan actively ran into the path of oncoming cars as they approached at over 200 mph, forcing drivers to take avoiding action. He was tackled by marshal Stephen Green who dragged him off the track and out of harm&#8217;s way.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><strong>2000 German Grand Prix track invasion</strong></h3>\n<p>Many of the track invasions of the past two decades have occurred as a form of protest, with one of the earliest examples coming at the <a href=\"https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/database/circuits/hockenheim/\">Hockenheimring</a> during the <a href=\"https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/database/races/2000-german-grand-prix/\">2000 German Grand Prix</a>. Robert Sehli, a disgruntled ex-Mercedes employee, took to the track mid-race in protest of his sacking. Wearing a raincoat brandished with anti-Mercedes slogans, Sehli walked across and along the circuit, waving to the crowd and mostly staying out the way of the oncoming cars.</p>\n<p>A safety car was deployed and Sehli was taken away and later fined. However, he would go on to win a court case over his dismissal from Mercedes and would gain sympathy from then head of Mercedes motor sport, Nobert Haug, who described Sehli&#8217;s dismissal as &#8220;scandalous&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><strong>1992 British Grand Prix track invasion</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img height=\"450\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Mansell fans at 1992 British Grand Prix\" src=\"\">\n\n\n\n<img height=\"450\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Mansell fans at 1992 British Grand Prix\" src=\"https://motorsportmagazine.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mansell-fans-at-1992-Briotish-Grand-Prix-800x450.jpg\">\n\n\n \n\n<p>During the height of &#8216;<a href=\"https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/articles/single-seaters/f1/mexican-wave-carried-me-victory-nigel-recalls-mansell-mania-silverstone/\">Mansell-mania</a>&#8217; and after another dominant victory from the Brummie driver to claim his <a href=\"https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/database/races/1992-british-grand-prix/\">third and final British Grand Prix win</a>, hundreds of fans stormed the track to get closer to their home hero. The images of <a href=\"https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/database/drivers/nigel-mansell\">Mansell&#8217;s</a> victorious FW14 being swamped by his adoring fans are some of the most memorable to come from Silverstone but the jubilation nearly turned to tragedy.</p>\n<p>As the other drivers swung around Woodcote to cross the line, the unexpected sea of invading fans forced some drivers into taking avoiding action. <a href=\"https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/database/drivers/damon-hill\">Damon Hill</a> was amongst them, making his race debut for <a href=\"https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/database/teams/brabham\">Brabham</a>, and remembers the perilous end to the Grand Prix: &#8220;They saw Nigel cross the line and thought &#8216;we&#8217;re going to celebrate early&#8217;. And I saw this guy run out onto the track, right in front of my car.&#8221; Fortunately everyone escaped uninjured and in years since, tighter rules and security measures were installed to prevent this kind of mass invasion from happening again.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><strong>1987 British Grand Prix</strong></h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/database/races/1987-british-grand-prix/\">1987 British Grand Prix</a> goes down as a classic thanks to the memorable battle between the Williams pair of Nigel Mansell and <a href=\"https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/database/drivers/nelson-piquet\">Nelson Piquet</a>. The home hero would go on to overtake Piquet for the lead and eventual victory with a brilliant and brave dive up the inside into Stowe corner.</p>\n<p>Mansell would finish the race to secure his first win on home soil sending the patriotic English fans into rapture as hundreds of fans burst through the fencing and on to the track to swamp Nigel who had crawled to a stop after running out of fuel.

The circuit has hosted many a grand prix thriller through the years \u2014\u2026\n\nThe country\u2019s leading motor sport event is likely to be an irresistible target for Just Stop Oil activists, who invaded the circuit in 2022, and have already disrupted Wimbledon and the World Snooker Championship this year. \u201cThere is possibly quite a high chance of something happening this weekend,\u201d said Williams\u2019 Alex Albon ahead of the race.\n\nSilverstone has recruited 100 extra marshals this weekend, partly to deal with the threat, but the difficulties of securing the circuit are obvious, with a capacity crowd expected on Sunday.\n\nLast year\u2019s protest was far from the first time that individuals have risked their lives alongside F1 cars, although the motivations and actions vary considerably. Scroll down for a rundown of previous grand prix track invasions.\n\n2022 British Grand Prix track invasion\n\nThe protesters at the start of the GP. So crazy to see cars going by, so lucky we had the red flag #f1 #BritishGP #BritishGrandPrix #BritishGrandPrix2022 #SilverstoneGP pic.twitter.com/gVNq2LCVbT \u2014 F1YEZ \ud83c\udfc1 (@F1YEZ_official) July 3, 2022\n\nLast year saw the most recent example of a track invasion at the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. Six climate protestors made their way on to the Wellington Straight during the opening lap of the race and sat down on the track, hoping to disrupt the start.\n\nHowever, Zhou Guanyu\u2019s enormous crash into Turn 1 brought out a safety car which slowed the grid before they reached the protestors, allowing marshals to drag the protestors off track in time. The alternative \u2014 of protestors on track as cars accelerated to 200mph \u2014 could have been disastrous.\n\nThe Just Stop Oil group has disrupted several high-profile events this year and Silverstone is anticipating a stunt at this year\u2019s race.The circuit\u2019s managing director Stuart Pringle has confirmed that there are extra plans in place to deter intruders.\n\n2015 Chinese Grand Prix- FP2 track invasion\n\nPerhaps the most bizarre example of a track invasion occurred during the second practice session of the Chinese Grand Prix in 2015. A local fan ran across the pit straight before jumping over the barrier into the pitlane and approaching the Ferrari garage. Reports say that he entered the garage waving his grandstand ticket, believing that he had paid for a go in an F1 car and that the Ferrari was his pick of the bunch. He was promptly detained by security and was unsurprisingly denied a test drive in his dream Ferrari.\n\n2015 Singapore Grand Prix track invasion\n\n2015 saw not one but two incidents of people making their way on to the track. After the the incident in Shanghai, another spectator decided to take a wander along the edge of the track during the Singapore Grand Prix later that year. Yogvatim Pravin Dhokia jumped over a barrier on the approach to turn 13 before running across the track in front of Sebastian Vettel whose Ferrari was barrelling towards him at 180 mph.\n\nDhokia made it across uninjured before walking further along the Marina Bay track and finding a gap in the fence and making his exit. His excursion brought out a safety car and Dhokia was promptly arrested and charged for disrupting the event.\n\n2004 Spanish Grand Prix track invasion\n\nNot all track invaders take their cause quite so seriously, as was the case with serial sports disruptor \u2018Jimmy Jump\u2019 who ran onto the circuit during the formation lap for the 2004 Spanish Grand Prix. Jimmy, real name Jaume Marquet i Cot, made a habit of disrupting sporting events in the early 2000s, including tennis matches and even the 2010 World Cup final. His unwanted appearance on the Catalunya circuit was swiftly ended by the trackside marshals allowing the race to start uninterrupted.\n\n2003 British Grand Prix track invasion\n\nOne of the best-remembered F1 track invasions came in 2003, with that year\u2019s British Grand Prix being disrupted by the laicised priest Neil Horan. Horan managed to enter onto Silverstone\u2019s Hangar straight, dressed in a kilt and adorned in a religious banner. Unlike Sehli three years earlier, Horan actively ran into the path of oncoming cars as they approached at over 200 mph, forcing drivers to take avoiding action. He was tackled by marshal Stephen Green who dragged him off the track and out of harm\u2019s way.\n\n2000 German Grand Prix track invasion\n\nMany of the track invasions of the past two decades have occurred as a form of protest, with one of the earliest examples coming at the Hockenheimring during the 2000 German Grand Prix. Robert Sehli, a disgruntled ex-Mercedes employee, took to the track mid-race in protest of his sacking. Wearing a raincoat brandished with anti-Mercedes slogans, Sehli walked across and along the circuit, waving to the crowd and mostly staying out the way of the oncoming cars.\n\nA safety car was deployed and Sehli was taken away and later fined. However, he would go on to win a court case over his dismissal from Mercedes and would gain sympathy from then head of Mercedes motor sport, Nobert Haug, who described Sehli\u2019s dismissal as \u201cscandalous\u201d.\n\n1992 British Grand Prix track invasion\n\nDuring the height of \u2018Mansell-mania\u2019 and after another dominant victory from the Brummie driver to claim his third and final British Grand Prix win, hundreds of fans stormed the track to get closer to their home hero. The images of Mansell\u2019s victorious FW14 being swamped by his adoring fans are some of the most memorable to come from Silverstone but the jubilation nearly turned to tragedy.\n\nAs the other drivers swung around Woodcote to cross the line, the unexpected sea of invading fans forced some drivers into taking avoiding action. Damon Hill was amongst them, making his race debut for Brabham, and remembers the perilous end to the Grand Prix: \u201cThey saw Nigel cross the line and thought \u2018we\u2019re going to celebrate early\u2019. And I saw this guy run out onto the track, right in front of my car.\u201d Fortunately everyone escaped uninjured and in years since, tighter rules and security measures were installed to prevent this kind of mass invasion from happening again.\n\n1987 British Grand Prix\n\nThe 1987 British Grand Prix goes down as a classic thanks to the memorable battle between the Williams pair of Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet. The home hero would go on to overtake Piquet for the lead and eventual victory with a brilliant and brave dive up the inside into Stowe corner.\n\nMansell would finish the race to secure his first win on home soil sending the patriotic English fans into rapture as hundreds of fans burst through the fencing and on to the track to swamp Nigel who had crawled to a stop after running out of fuel. However, this would not be the last time that a Mansell victory at Silverstone would lead to an invasion of hundred ecstatic fans on the track.",

            "article_html": "<div><p>At this point last year, <a href=\"https://www.motorsport.com/driver/charles-leclerc/109611/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Charles Leclerc</a> had two wins under his belt to lead <a href=\"https://www.motorsport.com/team/ferrari/3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ferrari</a>&#8217;s blossoming title challenge, its most credible since 2018. Twelve months on, he has only finished one race of three to call it the &#8220;worst-ever start of the season&#8221;. Meanwhile, a distant sixth in Saudi Arabia left team-mate <a href=\"https://www.motorsport.com/driver/carlos-sainz/15916/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Carlos Sainz</a> convinced that major car changes, rather than minor set-up tweaks, were now essential.&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>All told, Ferrari sits just fourth in the table while its 2022 rival Red Bull maintains a perfect win record. Yet new team boss Fred Vasseur cuts a much more optimistic figure. &#8220;We are [heading] in the right direction,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The mood in the team is more than good.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This positive sentiment comes despite him dismissing the prospect of Maranello designing a &#8216;B-spec&#8217; car for later this term. Since there is no silver bullet on the horizon certain to revive fortunes then, why is he this upbeat?&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>First, it should be acknowledged that both drivers and Vasseur might be guilty of overegging the pudding. Leclerc delivered his soundbite shortly after a contact-induced spin into the gravel on the opening lap of the Australian Grand Prix. Talking in the heat of the moment, it&#8217;s understandable if he held a particularly bleak outlook. Vasseur, meanwhile, might not want to tank morale or upset the Ferrari board this soon into his tenure so would be inclined to be a little more sanguine.&#160;</p>\n<p>It is also easy to pick fault with Vasseur citing the first three venues of Bahrain (abrasive asphalt), Saudi (dominated by straight-line performance) and Australia (heavily disrupted by red flags) as all having been anomalous. He says: &#8220;We need to understand that three events, it&#8217;s not the complete panel of the tracks&#8221;, and adds that fast Baku is also unconventional so even after four rounds, the true competitive order might not be clear. Only when the season settles down at more conventional circuits will Ferrari&#8217;s downforce-dominated car concept flex its muscles.&#160;&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><img src=\"//cdn-2.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0oOE3o70/s8/the-retired-car-of-charles-lec-1.jpg\" alt=\"The retired car of Charles Leclerc, Ferrari SF-23\">\n<p class=\"title\">The retired car of Charles Leclerc, Ferrari SF-23</p>\n<p class=\"photographer\">Photo by: Lionel Ng / <a href=\"https://www.motorsportimages.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Motorsport Images</a></p>\n<p>However, the problem with this argument is that to cast aside four tracks is to write off getting on for a quarter of the season. Plus, the team won at two of the venues last year and might have added a third in Azerbaijan had Leclerc&#8217;s engine not detonated. Finally, Red Bull&#8217;s clean sweep in this time proves a car can be suited to a variety of circumstances. But the SF-23 isn&#8217;t.&#160;</p>\n<p>It becomes easier to validate Vasseur&#8217;s optimism when reviewing a weekend down under that might be chalked as a missed opportunity. Tighter Melbourne should have better suited the Scuderia&#8217;s strengths over the previous round in Jeddah. But qualifying proved disappointing once again as Sainz chalked fifth with Leclerc a row behind in seventh.&#160;&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>However, some of their half-second deficit to polesitter <a href=\"https://www.motorsport.com/driver/max-verstappen/17529/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Max Verstappen</a> can be attributed to poor management from the pitwall. The Ferraris badly handled traffic on their preparation laps to allow tyre temperatures to drop and stymy their first sectors. A possible front-row start for one driver was lost, reckons Vasseur.&#160;</p>\n<p>While that marks poor execution, the fiddly final sector in Melbourne does indeed pave the way for cars to trip over one another. At other tracks, Ferrari should sort it better to be more in the mix. And refining trackside operations is a theoretically simpler task than upgrading a fundamentally subpar car. Hence, it&#8217;s not all doom and gloom.&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>Arguably, events 24 hours later also proved deceptive. Leclerc was eliminated from the race before completing a single sector. Sainz, meanwhile, cut through the red-flag disruption to occupy a sound fourth place when he crossed the line behind the safety car. A final classification of 12th&#160;was owed to the five-second penalty for punting <a href=\"https://www.motorsport.com/driver/fernando-alonso/489/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fernando Alonso</a> at the first corner, a decision which Ferrari has requested a right of review from the FIA.&#160;&#160;</p>\n<p>Frustration with the stewards aside, Sainz was swiftly forced into a drive of damage limitation after pitting immediately prior to the first stoppage. The looming red flag significantly compromised strategy. But as part of his recovery, race pace was comparable to <a href=\"https://www.motorsport.com/driver/lewis-hamilton/1278/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lewis Hamilton</a> and Fernando Alonso - within 0.2s per lap, while having the measure of <a href=\"https://www.motorsport.com/driver/lance-stroll/20950/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lance Stroll</a>.&#160;&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><img src=\"//cdn-3.motorsport.com/images/mgl/63vxzglY/s8/frederic-vasseur-team-principa-1.jpg\" alt=\"Frederic Vasseur, Team Principal and General Manager, Scuderia Ferrari\">\n<p class=\"title\">Frederic Vasseur, Team Principal and General Manager, Scuderia Ferrari</p>\n<p class=\"photographer\">Photo by: Ferrari</p>\n<p>Vasseur explains: &#8220;We took a direction a bit different in terms of development for Australia. It paid off. The feeling was strange after because we were very frustrated. Quali, we are not far away to do a good job and for different reasons we didn't deliver. In the race, the pace was OK for me. We were a bit unlucky on the safety car red flag and we had to do an extra pitstop. But after this, [Sainz] was able to come back, overtake a couple of cars to push on the tyres.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n<p>Once Sainz had calmed down after his punishment from Race Control, Vasseur reckoned he was similarly reassured: &#8220;He took also the positive of the weekend, considering that even if we didn't score points for different reasons, that we did a real step forward in terms of performance and we have still 20 races to go. We have to look about the future. He had a good reaction. He was with us for the simulator [last week] and with a good fighting spirit.&#8221;&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>When it comes to looking to the future, Vasseur promises Ferrari fans won&#8217;t have to wait long. While there will be no &#8216;B-spec&#8217; - a decision driven by the cost cap, aerodynamic restrictions and a belief there is plenty more to come from the current guise - a rapid stream of more minor updates are in the pipeline.&#160;&#160;</p>\n<p>These won&#8217;t be introduced for Baku, when many rivals will debut new parts after the four-week break ends with a race much closer to their European headquarters to save on freight. Additionally, Ferrari reckons it already has an optimised aero configuration for Azerbaijan. Plus, the adoption of a second qualifying session for the first sprint event makes the round less attractive for upgrades. There&#8217;s heightened risk of crashing when the revise schedule adds an extra competitive element, and fewer practice sessions leave less time to correlate the impact of the new components.&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>Instead, fresh parts will arrive for each of the Miami, Imola and Barcelona rounds. And these are being delivered ahead of time as Ferrari insists it has been quick to react to its tepid start. It has tweaked the development path to place an emphasis on resolving car balance and the update originally penned for Spain will now arrive in time for the first visit to Italy, for example.&#160;&#160;</p>\n<p>While the upgrade programme favours evolution over revolution, Vasseur confirms Ferrari will still be aggressive: &#8220;We will continue to update this one and we'll try to update massively&#8230;&#160;We have the feeling and I hope that we are right, and we are going in the right direction, that we have still tons of room for improvement on the car.&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>&#8220;It means that as long as we are still able to develop the car to get points, and the aero to get a better balance to get a better stability, it makes sense to push in this direction.\"&#160;</p>\n<p>There is a limit to Vasseur&#8217;s positivity. He refrains from committing to a goal of trumping Red Bull, <a href=\"https://www.motorsport.com/team/mercedes/5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mercedes</a> and Aston Martin. Rather, he wants his team to be insular.

            "text": "At this point last year, Charles Leclerc had two wins under his belt to lead Ferrari\u2019s blossoming title challenge, its most credible since 2018. Twelve months on, he has only finished one race of three to call it the \u201cworst-ever start of the season\u201d. Meanwhile, a distant sixth in Saudi Arabia left team-mate Carlos Sainz convinced that major car changes, rather than minor set-up tweaks, were now essential.\n\nAll told, Ferrari sits just fourth in the table while its 2022 rival Red Bull maintains a perfect win record. Yet new team boss Fred Vasseur cuts a much more optimistic figure. \u201cWe are [heading] in the right direction,\u201d he says. \u201cThe mood in the team is more than good.\u201d\n\nThis positive sentiment comes despite him dismissing the prospect of Maranello designing a \u2018B-spec\u2019 car for later this term. Since there is no silver bullet on the horizon certain to revive fortunes then, why is he this upbeat?\n\nFirst, it should be acknowledged that both drivers and Vasseur might be guilty of overegging the pudding. Leclerc delivered his soundbite shortly after a contact-induced spin into the gravel on the opening lap of the Australian Grand Prix. Talking in the heat of the moment, it\u2019s understandable if he held a particularly bleak outlook. Vasseur, meanwhile, might not want to tank morale or upset the Ferrari board this soon into his tenure so would be inclined to be a little more sanguine.\n\nIt is also easy to pick fault with Vasseur citing the first three venues of Bahrain (abrasive asphalt), Saudi (dominated by straight-line performance) and Australia (heavily disrupted by red flags) as all having been anomalous. He says: \u201cWe need to understand that three events, it\u2019s not the complete panel of the tracks\u201d, and adds that fast Baku is also unconventional so even after four rounds, the true competitive order might not be clear. Only when the season settles down at more conventional circuits will Ferrari\u2019s downforce-dominated car concept flex its muscles.\n\nThe retired car of Charles Leclerc, Ferrari SF-23 Photo by: Lionel Ng / Motorsport Images\n\nHowever, the problem with this argument is that to cast aside four tracks is to write off getting on for a quarter of the season. Plus, the team won at two of the venues last year and might have added a third in Azerbaijan had Leclerc\u2019s engine not detonated. Finally, Red Bull\u2019s clean sweep in this time proves a car can be suited to a variety of circumstances. But the SF-23 isn\u2019t.\n\nIt becomes easier to validate Vasseur\u2019s optimism when reviewing a weekend down under that might be chalked as a missed opportunity. Tighter Melbourne should have better suited the Scuderia\u2019s strengths over the previous round in Jeddah. But qualifying proved disappointing once again as Sainz chalked fifth with Leclerc a row behind in seventh.\n\nHowever, some of their half-second deficit to polesitter Max Verstappen can be attributed to poor management from the pitwall. The Ferraris badly handled traffic on their preparation laps to allow tyre temperatures to drop and stymy their first sectors. A possible front-row start for one driver was lost, reckons Vasseur.\n\nWhile that marks poor execution, the fiddly final sector in Melbourne does indeed pave the way for cars to trip over one another. At other tracks, Ferrari should sort it better to be more in the mix. And refining trackside operations is a theoretically simpler task than upgrading a fundamentally subpar car. Hence, it\u2019s not all doom and gloom.\n\nArguably, events 24 hours later also proved deceptive. Leclerc was eliminated from the race before completing a single sector. Sainz, meanwhile, cut through the red-flag disruption to occupy a sound fourth place when he crossed the line behind the safety car. A final classification of 12th was owed to the five-second penalty for punting Fernando Alonso at the first corner, a decision which Ferrari has requested a right of review from the FIA.\n\nFrustration with the stewards aside, Sainz was swiftly forced into a drive of damage limitation after pitting immediately prior to the first stoppage. The looming red flag significantly compromised strategy. But as part of his recovery, race pace was comparable to Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso - within 0.2s per lap, while having the measure of Lance Stroll.\n\nFrederic Vasseur, Team Principal and General Manager, Scuderia Ferrari Photo by: Ferrari\n\nVasseur explains: \u201cWe took a direction a bit different in terms of development for Australia. It paid off. The feeling was strange after because we were very frustrated. Quali, we are not far away to do a good job and for different reasons we didn't deliver. In the race, the pace was OK for me. We were a bit unlucky on the safety car red flag and we had to do an extra pitstop. But after this, [Sainz] was able to come back, overtake a couple of cars to push on the tyres.\u201d\n\nOnce Sainz had calmed down after his punishment from Race Control, Vasseur reckoned he was similarly reassured: \u201cHe took also the positive of the weekend, considering that even if we didn't score points for different reasons, that we did a real step forward in terms of performance and we have still 20 races to go. We have to look about the future. He had a good reaction. He was with us for the simulator [last week] and with a good fighting spirit.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to looking to the future, Vasseur promises Ferrari fans won\u2019t have to wait long. While there will be no \u2018B-spec\u2019 - a decision driven by the cost cap, aerodynamic restrictions and a belief there is plenty more to come from the current guise - a rapid stream of more minor updates are in the pipeline.\n\nThese won\u2019t be introduced for Baku, when many rivals will debut new parts after the four-week break ends with a race much closer to their European headquarters to save on freight. Additionally, Ferrari reckons it already has an optimised aero configuration for Azerbaijan. Plus, the adoption of a second qualifying session for the first sprint event makes the round less attractive for upgrades. There\u2019s heightened risk of crashing when the revise schedule adds an extra competitive element, and fewer practice sessions leave less time to correlate the impact of the new components.\n\nInstead, fresh parts will arrive for each of the Miami, Imola and Barcelona rounds. And these are being delivered ahead of time as Ferrari insists it has been quick to react to its tepid start. It has tweaked the development path to place an emphasis on resolving car balance and the update originally penned for Spain will now arrive in time for the first visit to Italy, for example.\n\nWhile the upgrade programme favours evolution over revolution, Vasseur confirms Ferrari will still be aggressive: \u201cWe will continue to update this one and we'll try to update massively\u2026 We have the feeling and I hope that we are right, and we are going in the right direction, that we have still tons of room for improvement on the car.\n\n\u201cIt means that as long as we are still able to develop the car to get points, and the aero to get a better balance to get a better stability, it makes sense to push in this direction.\"\n\nThere is a limit to Vasseur\u2019s positivity. He refrains from committing to a goal of trumping Red Bull, Mercedes and Aston Martin. Rather, he wants his team to be insular. Ferrari has underperformed and needs to first of all focus on getting the most from its car, nailing strategy and preventing further unreliability (even if these are shortfalls carried over straight from 2022). But, crucially, Vasseur says he has seen enough potential. This is what underlines his and the squad\u2019s upbeat tone.\n\n\u201cThe mood in the team is incredibly good for the level of results that we have,\u201d insists Vasseur. \u201cEverybody is very motivated, very focused. The drivers, they are very supportive with us. The relationship with John [Elkann, chairman] or with Benedetto [Vigna, CEO], trust me that it's also very positive. For sure, we don't have the results that we are expecting. But we are all working together to improve the situation.\u201d\n\nCharles Leclerc, Ferrari SF-23 Photo by: Ferrari",

            "text": "The Italian squad has endured its worst start to a Formula 1 season since 2009, when it failed to score a single point in the first three races of the campaign.\n\nIts lack of performance compared to pace-setter Red Bull prompted Sainz to suggest at the Australian Grand Prix that it was in need of a direction change.\n\n\"At the moment the Red Bull is superior everywhere,\" said Sainz. \"It's superior in quali, in races, in straightline speed.\n\n\"They are superior in medium/low-speed corners, they are superior with tyre management, superior over the kerbs and bumps. It just shows that we clearly need to change something.\n\n\"We need to go and check something very different from where we are now. I think the extremely good performance at the start of last season made us, I think, keep pushing with this concept, with this project of car.\n\n\"But I think we realise now that Red Bull has a clear advantage everywhere and that we need to start looking to our right and to our left.\"\n\nBut while there have been rumours in recent weeks that Ferrari was ready to embark on radical changes, including a shift of sidepod concept, such a move has been dismissed by team principal Fred Vasseur.\n\nInstead, Vasseur says the team's plan is for three stages of upgrades over the next few months that he hopes will be enough to make a difference.\n\nCharles Leclerc, Ferrari SF-23 Photo by: Ferrari\n\nAsked by Motorsport.com if a change of concept was coming, Vasseur said: \"No, I don't think so.\n\n\"We have a flow of updates that will come, not for Baku, because we have the aero package for the level of downforce, and with the sprint race it is not the easiest one, but for Miami, Imola, not Monaco, and Barcelona. At each race, we'll have an update on the car.\n\n\"We are sticking to the plan. We have made some adjustments in terms of balance and behaviour, and it was much better in Melbourne, and we'll continue in this direction.\n\n\"It's not a B-car if that is what you want to say. We won't come with something completely different. We will continue to update this one and we'll try to update massively.\"\n\nVasseur explained that the restrictions teams faced with both F1's cost cap and wind tunnel hours meant that changing concepts at this stage of the season was too tough a task.\n\n\"To do a new project during the season, to start from scratch, to do a new car with the cost cap, but also considering the restriction of the wind tunnel time, I don't want to say that it's impossible, but it's very difficult.\n\n\"Also, on our side, we have the feeling, and I hope that we are right, that we are going in the right direction, that we have still tons of room for improvement on the car.\n\n\"It means that as long as we are still able to develop the car to get [downforce] points, and the aero to get a better balance, to get a better stability and so, I think it makes sense to push in this direction.\"\n\nFerrari's preferred response to its difficult start to 2023 is to speed up the introduction of planned upgrades, rather than do something different with its car and start from scratch.\n\nVasseur added: \"You have always a plan of development before the season, and then you have to react due to the circumstances, due to the competitiveness of the car, and due to the behaviour of the car.

            "text": "The lack of overtaking on the track could benefit a few teams, Ferrari foremost among them\n\nFerrari has done a good job in qualifying sessions this season, even if things have gone sideways during the races at times. (Marco Bello/REUTERS)\n\nThe narrow Circuit de Monaco course is unlike any other track on the F1 calendar.\n\nOvertaking is harder at the 94-year-old track than it is anywhere else, as drivers simply don't have room to get past one another. The Monaco Grand Prix is a great test of driver skill, as there's far less space to maneuver, but it is not a fan favorite.\n\nIn 2003, Juan Pablo Montoya won a version of the event that didn't include a single overtake \u2014 one of just three F1 races since 1950 to share that dubious distinction. Two years ago, the only driver to get past another was Mick Schumacher, who stole a position from his own teammate on the first lap of the race.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT\n\nBecause getting past opponents at this race is so difficult, qualifying well is absolutely crucial. Since 1950, only 10 drivers have been able to win without qualifying in the top three. Teams that know how to orchestrate a quick pit stop are also in a good spot, as strong execution in the pit lane is one of the most reliable ways to jump opponents in a race in which overtakes are at a premium.\n\nAs a result, teams that set themselves up well on the starting grid and don't waste time with their stops have a chance to excel in Monaco.\n\nOutside of Red Bull, which remain in its own league, the team that fits that description the best this season is Ferrari. But there are some caveats to that statement.\n\nDisastrous strategy errors cost the Prancing Horses a win at this circuit in 2022, despite qualifying first and second. No team has been more adept at getting in its own way over the past couple of years, and Ferrari can be tough to trust.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFerrari's top driver \u2014 and hometown hero \u2014 Charles Leclerc has also been snakebitten at this track, finishing just once in four attempts at the F1 level in his home country. He even snatched defeat from the jaws of victory in Monaco as an F2 driver in 2017 due to a mechanical failure.\n\nThat said, Ferrari profiles as the team most likely to beat expectations Sunday. That's largely because the Italian squad has been significantly better in qualifying than on the track thus far in 2023.\n\nPutting aside the Azerbaijan GP sprint race, the positions Ferrari has held on the starting grid this season have been worth 113 points, and they've earned 67 from their finishing positions. The team with the second-biggest drop-off between their starts and finishes is Alpine \u2014 and that's a difference of just 14 points.\n\nIn most contexts, it's tough to interpret that information as good news for Ferrari, but the team is at its best in qualifying, which is what matters most in Monaco.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFerrari has also been efficient in the pit lane. The team has made the fastest pit stop in three of the five races this season. Looking at their most direct competition, Mercedes and Aston Martin, they've had a clear edge.\n\nBelow are the three second-tier teams' average stop times for each race in seconds \u2014 with the exception of the Australian Grand Prix, in which multiple restarts prevented regular pit activity.\n\nVia Formula1.com\n\nFerrari got the better of both of its top rivals in three of these four races and has demonstrated a significant edge over Aston Martin in particular. While an indefensible double stop cost them dearly last year, this time around, their acumen in the pit lane could be a weapon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo other team has the same combination of fast qualifying times and quick pit stops to make them as obvious a candidate to pop Sunday as Ferrari, but there are a couple worth monitoring.\n\nAlpine can't claim strong pit-stop performance, but both Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly have produced top-10 qualifying results in three of their five races this season.

You can&#8217;t start the season saying you&#8217;re happy with P2, it would be a lack of ambition.</p><img alt=\"formula 1 testing in abu dhabi day one\" title=\"Formula 1 Testing in Abu Dhabi - Day One\" width=\"4038\" height=\"2693\" src=\"https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/charles-leclerc-of-monaco-driving-the-ferrari-f1-75-on-news-photo-1674825615.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.847xh;0,0.0416xh&amp;resize=980:*\" class=\"css-0 exi4f7p0\"><p class=\"css-9t4b5 e1xqj1sx1\">Charles Leclerc finished second in the 2022 Formula 1 Drivers&#8217; Championship, but that doesn&#8217;t mean he&#8217;s necessarily the No. 1 driver at Ferrari going into this season.</p><p class=\"css-1vlouno e6iqukd2\">Bryn Lennon</p><p class=\"css-1b9ytva e6iqukd0\">//</p><p class=\"css-1vlouno e6iqukd1\">Getty Images</p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">&#8220;I&#8217;m really convinced that at Ferrari&#8212;and for sure my experience is limited to the last two weeks&#8212;but we have everything to win.

On one side it produced a rapid car, particularly in qualifying, and finished second in both championships, re-establishing itself as a front-runner after a couple of years in the wilderness.</p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">On the other hand, it frequently faltered on race day&#8212;through strategic misses, reliability problems and driver blunders&#8212;and mis-stepped in the development battle against its rivals. </p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">Vasseur asserted that it would be &#8220;arrogant&#8221; of him to enact immediate changes without a full understanding of the team but that his approach is that &#8220;we always have to do a better job tomorrow than today. If you say &#8216;okay today the team is in a good shape, you are dead&#8217;; you always need to have the mindset of &#8216;okay where we can improve here, (what about) this area&#8217;, and it is a no-end process.&#8221;</p><img alt=\"f1 grand prix of abu dhabi\" title=\"F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sergio-perez-of-mexico-and-oracle-red-bull-racing-and-news-photo-1674825772.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.847xh;0,0.0364xh&amp;resize=980:*\" class=\"css-0 exi4f7p0\"><p class=\"css-9t4b5 e1xqj1sx1\">Carlos Sainz, right, who finished fifth in the F1 Drivers&#8217; Standings last season, will be given every opportunity to be the No. 1 at Ferrari this year.</p><p class=\"css-1vlouno e6iqukd2\">Rudy Carezzevoli</p><p class=\"css-1b9ytva e6iqukd0\">//</p><p class=\"css-1vlouno e6iqukd1\">Getty Images</p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">The strategic team has come under pressure externally and Vasseur outlined that the structure will be evaluated rather than targeting specific individuals&#8212;a tacit admission that there are weaknesses that require a remedy. </p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">&#8220;When you are talking about strategy (teams), or aerodynamic (teams), or another topic, you have to avoid being focused on the top of the pyramid,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Very often, when you are speaking about strategy, it is a matter of organization rather than just the guy on the pit wall. </p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to understand exactly what&#8217;s happened on every single mistake of last year: if it is a matter of a decision, if it is a matter of organization, a matter of communication. Very often on the pit wall the bigger issue is the communication than the individuals, maybe too many people are discussing the same thing and the car will be on the next lap!

            "text": "Frederic Vasseur was appointed team principal at Ferrari for 2023, joining from the Sauber-owned Alfa Romeo squad, to replace Mattia Binotto.\n\nFerrari was the early leader in the championship last season before falling on hard times and going winless over the final 11 races of the season.\n\nFerrari\u2019s 2023 Formula 1 car will be unveiled on February 14.\n\nFerrari has to set high ambitions and aim for its first Formula 1 title in 15 years, according to its new team principal Frederic Vasseur.\n\nFerrari last won the Constructors\u2019 Championship in 2008, with its most recent Drivers\u2019 crown coming in 2007, and last year it finished a distant second to Red Bull Racing.\n\nVasseur was appointed for 2023, joining from the Sauber-owned Alfa Romeo squad, to replace Mattia Binotto, who tendered his resignation after four years in charge.\n\nVasseur, speaking during his first press conference as Ferrari\u2019s team principal, outlined that \u201cwhen you are in a top team, you can\u2019t have another target other than to win. You can\u2019t start the season saying you\u2019re happy with P2, it would be a lack of ambition.\n\nCharles Leclerc finished second in the 2022 Formula 1 Drivers\u2019 Championship, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s necessarily the No. 1 driver at Ferrari going into this season. Bryn Lennon // Getty Images\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really convinced that at Ferrari\u2014and for sure my experience is limited to the last two weeks\u2014but we have everything to win. We have to put everything together to do a good job but we have everything to be able to win.\u201d\n\nVasseur has taken up the reins at a team that had a puzzling 2022 season. On one side it produced a rapid car, particularly in qualifying, and finished second in both championships, re-establishing itself as a front-runner after a couple of years in the wilderness.\n\nOn the other hand, it frequently faltered on race day\u2014through strategic misses, reliability problems and driver blunders\u2014and mis-stepped in the development battle against its rivals.\n\nVasseur asserted that it would be \u201carrogant\u201d of him to enact immediate changes without a full understanding of the team but that his approach is that \u201cwe always have to do a better job tomorrow than today. If you say \u2018okay today the team is in a good shape, you are dead\u2019; you always need to have the mindset of \u2018okay where we can improve here, (what about) this area\u2019, and it is a no-end process.\u201d\n\nCarlos Sainz, right, who finished fifth in the F1 Drivers\u2019 Standings last season, will be given every opportunity to be the No. 1 at Ferrari this year. Rudy Carezzevoli // Getty Images\n\nThe strategic team has come under pressure externally and Vasseur outlined that the structure will be evaluated rather than targeting specific individuals\u2014a tacit admission that there are weaknesses that require a remedy.\n\n\u201cWhen you are talking about strategy (teams), or aerodynamic (teams), or another topic, you have to avoid being focused on the top of the pyramid,\u201d he said. \u201cVery often, when you are speaking about strategy, it is a matter of organization rather than just the guy on the pit wall.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to understand exactly what\u2019s happened on every single mistake of last year: if it is a matter of a decision, if it is a matter of organization, a matter of communication. Very often on the pit wall the bigger issue is the communication than the individuals, maybe too many people are discussing the same thing and the car will be on the next lap! You need a clear flow of discussion between the good people\u2014it\u2019s work in progress.\u201d\n\nRelated Story Meet Ferrari's New F1 Team Principal\n\nVasseur added that reliability gains on Ferrari\u2019s 2023-spec power unit, a main target for improvement, \u201clooks okay\u201d but that the gains will not be fully known until the car hits the track in Bahrain.\n\nFerrari will enter 2023 with an unchanged driver lineup of last year\u2019s runner-up Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz.

Ferrari, Vasseur emphasized, will operate a policy of equality for as long as it makes sense.\n\n\u201cI think it is the same everywhere in that we have two very good drivers that they are able to do the job,\u201d Vasseur explained. \u201cWe will have the capacity to provide them exactly the same car, the same structure, the same support.\n\n\u201cWhat is clear the target is to win with Ferrari...\"\n\n\u201cWhat is clear the target is to win with Ferrari, and for Ferrari, there will be no number one and number two, but if at one stage we have to take action I will take action\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter if it is for one or the other, but if at one stage of the season I have to do something I will do it.\u201d\n\nMore F1 News\n\n\u2022 Ferrari\u2019s 2023 Formula 1 car will be unveiled on February 14 during a busy week of launches that is also set to include McLaren, Aston Martin, Mercedes and Alpine.\n\n\u2022 Haas is set to kick-start launch season when it presents its 2023 livery on Tuesday (January 31).\n\n\u2022 Preseason testing will take place in Bahrain across February 23-25 before the 23-event season commences in the country on March 5.\n\n\u2022 Betting organization Stake has joined Alfa Romeo as its new title partner, with PKN Orlen switching to AlphaTauri as principal partner.",

It has been difficult, but I think that will make me only stronger in the future.\n\n\"I know that we need to count only on ourselves. That is the most important lesson of the season.\"\n\nBut at the very time when Binotto needed to count on Ferrari, and for chairman John Elkann and CEO Benedetto Vigna to give him the full support he needed, he was let down.\n\nCharles Leclerc, Ferrari, Mattia Binotto, Team Principal, Ferrari Photo by: Ferrari\n\nThere was a clear opportunity for Ferrari to suggest that he bring in someone senior alongside him to ease him of any responsibilities that were a distraction, and drill down deep in addressing the team's weak spots. This would have been understandable and a positive step for 2023.\n\nUltimately though, without the backing from above, Binotto knew his days were numbered and the decision was made to offer his resignation. Ferrari must now find a replacement.\n\nBut whoever Ferrari gets in as Binotto's successor is going to inherit a bit of a poisoned chalice, as there will be no excuses for anything less than dominating F1 next year.\n\nVigna recently remarked in an interview with CNBC that he was not willing to accept finishing runner-up.\n\n\"I said it after the last quarter, I am not satisfied with second place because second is first of the losers,\" he told the broadcaster.\n\n\"We have made some progress. I'm happy with the progress we've made. I'm not happy with second place. I think the team has what it takes to improve over time.\"\n\nThis effectively means that it is win or bust for next year, which puts a ridiculous amount of pressure on a new team boss to get their feet under the desk and pull instant results out of the hat.\n\nIt is something that, when going up against the might of Red Bull and Mercedes in the cost cap era, is simply not going to happen.\n\nAnd if that instant winning form isn't there, then there is a risk of extra criticism, destabilising forces infecting the team, and then the prospect of a rampant blame culture forcing heads to roll to appease the doubters.\n\nHistory repeating\n\nFerrari's most successful era of modern times came when Jean Todt successfully kept Ferrari's racing team separated from the external politics and criticism that can drag it down.\n\nAnd even when Ferrari lost drivers' championships it could have won in 1997 and 1998, there was no knee-jerk reaction to change the management.\n\nMattia Binotto, Team Principal, Ferrari Photo by: Ferrari\n\nThings were progressing and it was just a question of giving it time to evolve and make the next step \u2013 as happened when it began a run of success that would last until the mid-2000s.\n\nBinotto never shied away from the fact that getting Ferrari back to the front of F1 was a long-term project and was not going to happen overnight \u2013 and that is a story that rang true as much under the Todt era as it does now.\n\nIf anything, Ferrari's strong start to 2022 distorted the progress, as it far exceeded expectations and the trajectory they were on.\n\nThings were also skewed by Red Bull underperforming in the first phase of the season with an overweight car. As Binotto rightly pointed out, trimming weight to find performance over the campaign is a much easier job than delivering the aero gains that Ferrari needed - so Red Bull was always on a better glide slope during the year.\n\nAs Ferrari hunts for a new team boss who knows that anything less than victory against Red Bull and Mercedes in 2023 will be viewed as a failure, Maranello is at risk of putting Binotto's replacement in an impossible position.\n\nUnrealistic expectations to not finish second will prompt extreme reactions and further change, which then can trigger even more problems in the future, and the cycle repeats.\n\nIt is something Ferrari was guilty of in the past, and it's now very much opened up the risk of it becoming its biggest weakness in the future.",

He hasn&#8217;t been dispatched on an immediate gardening leave, which sometimes happens straight away when a key player puts his hand up and says I&#8217;m off.</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>Indeed, Vasseur is adamant that he&#8217;s happy to see Mekies get a chance to join the exclusive club of team principals, while admitting that as yet there&#8217;s no agreement on the precise details and timing of his departure.</p>\n   <img src=\"//cdn-5.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6AEoRG16/s1000/laurent-mekies-racing-director-1.jpg\" alt=\"Laurent Mekies, Racing Director, Ferrari  Press Conference \"> \n<p class=\"title\">Laurent Mekies, Racing Director, Ferrari Press Conference</p>\n<p class=\"photographer\">Photo by: FIA Pool</p>\n<p>\"First of all, I think it's a mega opportunity for Laurent,&#8221; he says. &#8220;And I'm considering also that I have a good relationship with him, and I won't block Laurent for sure.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Then if you speak about timeline, I think that Toro Rosso [sic] was probably a bit aggressive on the press release, and we have a long-term contract with Laurent. And we'll have to discuss about details.\"</p>\n<p>Vasseur confirms that there&#8217;s no decision yet on how long Mekies will remain on frontline duty with Ferrari.</p>\n<p>\"This will depend on the condition of the change. For sure as I said before, we have a long-term contract with him and we'll have to find the best for Ferrari, and depending on when he will leave the company, and when he will move to Toro Rosso, we will decide the end of the collaboration.</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>&#8220;But I'm not scared about this, because we will do it properly, and the relationship is very positive.\"</p>\n<p>So when did Mekies tell his boss that he wanted to leave?</p>\n<p>\"This is the relationship between Laurent and myself, and I won't disclose details,&#8221; says Vasseur.&#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But we had a very open discussion on this, because I've known Laurent for 30 years. And I think that it's very difficult to refuse this kind of proposal for him. And he was very open on the discussion.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can perfectly put myself in Laurent&#8217;s position. And I think it's quite impossible to refuse when you are in this business to become a team principal.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Now I'm there to protect the interests of Ferrari. And it's Ferrari first and it will be always Ferrari first, and it means that we'll have to discuss about the conditions of this.\"</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p>   <img src=\"//cdn-5.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6D1QPVO0/s1000/carlos-sainz-ferrari-sf-23-cha-1.jpg\" alt=\"Carlos Sainz, Ferrari SF-23, Charles Leclerc, Ferrari SF-23\"> \n<p class=\"title\">Carlos Sainz, Ferrari SF-23, Charles Leclerc, Ferrari SF-23</p>\n<p class=\"photographer\">Photo by: Ferrari</p>\n<p>Vasseur is also convinced that Mekies will do a good job. Between his first spell at Toro Rosso and his move to Ferrari in 2018, the 45-year-old worked for the FIA as safety director and deputy race director, and has thus seen the sport from a very different angle. At Maranello he had a complete overview of all aspects of the team.</p>\n<p>\"If you are looking for a team principal in F1 you don't have so long a list of people knowing F1, the FIA and so on,&#8221; says Vasseur. &#8220;You have a list of five or 10 people in the group.</p>\n<p>\"I think he has a very, very wide understanding of the business, coming from race engineer to the FIA. And for sure, in this kind of job, you are looking for someone with a complete understanding of the business. And I think he will do a good job.\"</p>\n<p>One intriguing aspect is that many saw Mekies as a future Ferrari team principal, having held the deputy role.</p>\n<p>Indeed, until Vasseur got the nod he could have been a potential successor for Mattia Binotto. So, could he have become frustrated after missing out?</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>\"I think for this you have to ask to Laurent,&#8221; said Vasseur. &#8220;But it's true that if you want to become the team principal of an F1 team, you have 10 jobs in the world. It's not that you can find it everywhere.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It means that if it was the personal goal of Laurent, I can perfectly understand this. You have to be ambitious, Laurent is as an ambitious person, and I think he did a very good job for Ferrari. And I can understand the motivation and the expectation points.&#8221;</p>\n   <img src=\"//cdn-2.motorsport.com/images/mgl/68yNZdB0/s1000/carlos-sainz-ferrari-sf-23-yuk-1.jpg\" alt=\"Carlos Sainz, Ferrari SF-23, Yuki Tsunoda, AlphaTauri AT04\"> \n<p class=\"title\">Carlos Sainz, Ferrari SF-23, Yuki Tsunoda, AlphaTauri AT04</p>\n<p class=\"photographer\">Photo by: Lionel Ng / <a href=\"https://www.motorsportimages.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Motorsport Images</a></p>\n<p>So what's next for Ferrari? Mekies covered a lot of ground at Maranello, and latterly as sporting director one of his main jobs was liaising with the FIA. Vasseur says it&#8217;s too early to say how he will be replaced, and by whom.</p>\n<p>He adds that the team in any case has been hiring key people, but not yet told the world about it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;He is sporting director, so the hole is quite large. And it will be part of the reorganisation of the company. You know that we are in a long process and it's taking time, but we are recruiting a lot outside, and you will have names quite soon.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But it will be part of the reorganisation, and we could split the job into two different positions as some other teams are doing, and this is part of restructuring.\"</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>His friend&#8217;s impending departure is obviously a personal blow for Vasseur, but he insists that the team will work around it.</p>\n<p>\"To lose one person in 1600 it's not a drama,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The power of the team is always more important and the power of the group than the individuals. We have to keep this in mind, that the most important is the group.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The group is there. We are recruiting massively &#8211; we are not communicating, but we are recruiting massively. And we will do step-by-step because you can't put an organisation in place in two weeks, you know perfectly the system of the recruitment in F1, it's quite long and painful.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are working on it. But don't expect that one day you will have a new organisation. It will be step-by-step, and we are putting something in place.\"</p>\n   <img src=\"//cdn-4.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0ZRKRPb0/s1000/frederic-vasseur-team-principa-1.jpg\" alt=\"Frederic Vasseur, Team Principal and General Manager, Scuderia Ferrari \"> \n<p class=\"title\">Frederic Vasseur, Team Principal and General Manager, Scuderia Ferrari</p>\n<p class=\"photographer\">Photo by: Simon Galloway / <a href=\"https://www.motorsportimages.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Motorsport Images</a></p>\n<p>With senior engineer David Sanchez having recently left ahead of a move to <a href=\"https://www.motorsport.com/team/mclaren/10/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McLaren</a> in 2024, it&#8217;s starting to look like an exodus of key players, but Vasseur says that it&#8217;s just normal F1 business.</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>He reiterates that there&#8217;s a bigger picture as he tries to make the team into a winning machine once more.</p>\n<p>\"In every single team you have to build up your own group and to build up something.</p>\n<p>\"Now we have to be clear that we are speaking, and it's absolutely not against Laurent and the skills of Laurent and so on, but we are speaking about two people in a group of more than 1000 people.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For sure individuals are important, but it's nothing compared to the group. And we have to build up something on the group, not on individuals.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And okay, Laurent decided to move, and as I said before, I'm fully respectful with the decision of Laurent, because I think it's an opportunity for anyone. But this mid-term won't impact the development of Ferrari.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When you have over 1000 employees, and you have a turnover of 6-7%, it means that we have 100 people a year leaving the company and joining the company.

He hasn\u2019t been dispatched on an immediate gardening leave, which sometimes happens straight away when a key player puts his hand up and says I\u2019m off.\n\nIndeed, Vasseur is adamant that he\u2019s happy to see Mekies get a chance to join the exclusive club of team principals, while admitting that as yet there\u2019s no agreement on the precise details and timing of his departure.\n\nLaurent Mekies, Racing Director, Ferrari Press Conference Photo by: FIA Pool\n\n\"First of all, I think it's a mega opportunity for Laurent,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I'm considering also that I have a good relationship with him, and I won't block Laurent for sure.\n\n\u201cThen if you speak about timeline, I think that Toro Rosso [sic] was probably a bit aggressive on the press release, and we have a long-term contract with Laurent. And we'll have to discuss about details.\"\n\nVasseur confirms that there\u2019s no decision yet on how long Mekies will remain on frontline duty with Ferrari.\n\n\"This will depend on the condition of the change. For sure as I said before, we have a long-term contract with him and we'll have to find the best for Ferrari, and depending on when he will leave the company, and when he will move to Toro Rosso, we will decide the end of the collaboration.\n\n\u201cBut I'm not scared about this, because we will do it properly, and the relationship is very positive.\"\n\nSo when did Mekies tell his boss that he wanted to leave?\n\n\"This is the relationship between Laurent and myself, and I won't disclose details,\u201d says Vasseur.\n\n\u201cBut we had a very open discussion on this, because I've known Laurent for 30 years. And I think that it's very difficult to refuse this kind of proposal for him. And he was very open on the discussion.\n\n\u201cI can perfectly put myself in Laurent\u2019s position. And I think it's quite impossible to refuse when you are in this business to become a team principal.\n\n\u201cNow I'm there to protect the interests of Ferrari. And it's Ferrari first and it will be always Ferrari first, and it means that we'll have to discuss about the conditions of this.\"\n\nCarlos Sainz, Ferrari SF-23, Charles Leclerc, Ferrari SF-23 Photo by: Ferrari\n\nVasseur is also convinced that Mekies will do a good job. Between his first spell at Toro Rosso and his move to Ferrari in 2018, the 45-year-old worked for the FIA as safety director and deputy race director, and has thus seen the sport from a very different angle. At Maranello he had a complete overview of all aspects of the team.\n\n\"If you are looking for a team principal in F1 you don't have so long a list of people knowing F1, the FIA and so on,\u201d says Vasseur. \u201cYou have a list of five or 10 people in the group.\n\n\"I think he has a very, very wide understanding of the business, coming from race engineer to the FIA. And for sure, in this kind of job, you are looking for someone with a complete understanding of the business. And I think he will do a good job.\"\n\nOne intriguing aspect is that many saw Mekies as a future Ferrari team principal, having held the deputy role.\n\nIndeed, until Vasseur got the nod he could have been a potential successor for Mattia Binotto. So, could he have become frustrated after missing out?\n\n\"I think for this you have to ask to Laurent,\u201d said Vasseur. \u201cBut it's true that if you want to become the team principal of an F1 team, you have 10 jobs in the world. It's not that you can find it everywhere.\n\n\u201cIt means that if it was the personal goal of Laurent, I can perfectly understand this. You have to be ambitious, Laurent is as an ambitious person, and I think he did a very good job for Ferrari. And I can understand the motivation and the expectation points.\u201d\n\nCarlos Sainz, Ferrari SF-23, Yuki Tsunoda, AlphaTauri AT04 Photo by: Lionel Ng / Motorsport Images\n\nSo what's next for Ferrari? Mekies covered a lot of ground at Maranello, and latterly as sporting director one of his main jobs was liaising with the FIA. Vasseur says it\u2019s too early to say how he will be replaced, and by whom.\n\nHe adds that the team in any case has been hiring key people, but not yet told the world about it.\n\n\u201cHe is sporting director, so the hole is quite large. And it will be part of the reorganisation of the company. You know that we are in a long process and it's taking time, but we are recruiting a lot outside, and you will have names quite soon.\n\n\u201cBut it will be part of the reorganisation, and we could split the job into two different positions as some other teams are doing, and this is part of restructuring.\"\n\nHis friend\u2019s impending departure is obviously a personal blow for Vasseur, but he insists that the team will work around it.\n\n\"To lose one person in 1600 it's not a drama,\u201d he says. \u201cThe power of the team is always more important and the power of the group than the individuals. We have to keep this in mind, that the most important is the group.\n\n\u201cThe group is there. We are recruiting massively \u2013 we are not communicating, but we are recruiting massively. And we will do step-by-step because you can't put an organisation in place in two weeks, you know perfectly the system of the recruitment in F1, it's quite long and painful.\n\n\u201cWe are working on it. But don't expect that one day you will have a new organisation. It will be step-by-step, and we are putting something in place.\"\n\nFrederic Vasseur, Team Principal and General Manager, Scuderia Ferrari Photo by: Simon Galloway / Motorsport Images\n\nWith senior engineer David Sanchez having recently left ahead of a move to McLaren in 2024, it\u2019s starting to look like an exodus of key players, but Vasseur says that it\u2019s just normal F1 business.\n\nHe reiterates that there\u2019s a bigger picture as he tries to make the team into a winning machine once more.\n\n\"In every single team you have to build up your own group and to build up something.\n\n\"Now we have to be clear that we are speaking, and it's absolutely not against Laurent and the skills of Laurent and so on, but we are speaking about two people in a group of more than 1000 people.\n\n\u201cFor sure individuals are important, but it's nothing compared to the group. And we have to build up something on the group, not on individuals.\n\n\u201cAnd okay, Laurent decided to move, and as I said before, I'm fully respectful with the decision of Laurent, because I think it's an opportunity for anyone. But this mid-term won't impact the development of Ferrari.\n\n\u201cWhen you have over 1000 employees, and you have a turnover of 6-7%, it means that we have 100 people a year leaving the company and joining the company. Sometimes from a staff point of view you [the media] pay attention to one or two.\n\n\u201cWe have 100 people a year joining the company, coming half from the other teams, half from the other business.\n\n\"It means that sometimes you are paying a lot of attention to names. But it's not this which is driving the performance.\u201d\n\nThe Ferrari team Photo by: Mark Sutton / Motorsport Images",
