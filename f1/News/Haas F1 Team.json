            "article_html": "<div><h3>Red Bull</h3>\n<p>It was a mixed day at Red Bull, for while Max Verstappen charged to yet another pole position &#8211; his fifth in a row and seventh of the season so far &#8211; team mate Sergio Perez dropped out in Q1 to continue his painful qualifying run. The Mexican later gained a position after Valtteri Bottas was disqualified. It means Verstappen is likely to be fighting the McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri by himself during Sunday&#8217;s Grand Prix.</p>\n<p><strong>Max Verstappen, 1st, 1:26.720</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was quite a crazy qualifying, very hectic and slippery in some places. I had a little &#8216;inchident&#8217; in the pit lane, I understeered as I turned and the car just went straight - I think there was quite a bit of damage. That aside, very happy. Equally, I&#8217;m very happy for McLaren, you could see how excited everyone was in that garage, they&#8217;ve worked so hard, it&#8217;s also great for the British fans too.\nI&#8217;m expecting the Ferraris and Mercedes to be more competitive during the race. As for us, we know that we have a good race car and I&#8217;m already looking forward to it. I don&#8217;t mind if it&#8217;s wet tomorrow, in FP3 we were very fast in the wet so I don&#8217;t think we need to worry.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Sergio Perez, 15th, 1:29.968</strong></p>\n<p>\"Today was quite disappointing. The red flag lasted a lot longer than we initially thought it would so we lost some heat on the tyres and couldn&#8217;t get enough temperature back into them. We also struggled with the weather. The changing conditions made things a lot trickier, so we ended up having a poor qualifying. We had a good session yesterday so, for now, we need to look forward to tomorrow and just aim to get any many points as possible. It&#8217;s going to be difficult to come through the field but we will try our very best.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Christian Horner, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>\"A mixed bag from qualifying today. The weather was about as British as it gets; raining while sunny. This complicated things for us slightly but it looks like the race will be dryer so we won&#8217;t have to flip flop between inters and slicks as we have done today. The change in conditions means we won&#8217;t be able to take a lot of the data from practice with us but we will certainly take the pole from qualifying.</p>\n<p>\"It was another great performance from Max, his 5th pole in a row. Conversely, another tough quali for Checo but remaining confident for a good run tomorrow with plenty to race for.\"</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"NORTHAMPTON, ENGLAND - JULY 08: Pole position qualifier Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        Pole went to Verstappen and Red Bull in a wet-dry qualifying at Silverstone\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <h3>Mercedes</h3>\n<p>Mercedes had a quiet start to their British Grand Prix weekend, and while qualifying brought an improvement, George Russell and Lewis Hamilton (after a wild spin in Q1) had to settle for sixth and seventh on the grid. Starting just behind the Ferraris, there could be quite a battle between the red and black cars on race day.</p>\n<p><strong>Lewis Hamilton, 7th, 1:27.211</strong></p>\n<p>\"We weren&#8217;t quite quick enough today unfortunately. The conditions were tricky out there but there was still an element of fun to it, as we tried to get on top of the tyres. There were some moments where it looked like we had the potential to challenge further forward, but then we fell back a little. We seem to struggle on the single lap more than we do on the race pace, so we will see what we can do tomorrow. If we can progress forward, then that would be amazing. Hopefully we can put some pressure on the cars ahead and get into a battle with them.\"</p>\n<p><strong>George Russell, 6th, 1:27.155</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was an exciting session; I really enjoy these conditions. I&#8217;m always confident that I can do a good job and put the laps in when needed. It was stressful at times, but I felt comfortable with our pace in Q1 and Q2. My last lap in Q3 was strong, but it was frustrating to see how close we were to being a couple of positions further forward. I was a little bit disappointed not to achieve this but we&#8217;re in a decent place for tomorrow. The Team did a good job of improving the car overnight and I&#8217;m excited to see what we can do in the Grand Prix. We believe we have stronger race pace than on the single lap, so I&#8217;m confident that we can move forward.</p>\n<p>\"Once again, the energy from the fans today has been amazing. You really feel the support from the stands and it&#8217;s incredible to see how they are backing the Team and us as drivers. It&#8217;s a special weekend and we can hopefully do a good job tomorrow and challenge for the podium.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Toto Wolff, Team Principal and CEO</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was an interesting session today, with the gap between P2 and P7 only a few tenths. We were more competitive than we thought we might be in terms of lap time, and the gap to the front-row is small. That is not an excuse though and P6 and P7 are the positions we are in. The question for us now is how much pace differential you need in order to overtake. There are several cars ahead of us but we&#8217;re hopeful we can make some good progress.</p>\n<p>\"Whilst it&#8217;s frustrating in one sense, it's also encouraging to see the lap time gains that others have found, including McLaren recently. It&#8217;s a good example of how you can add performance during the season. We&#8217;ve been able to do so ourselves and we&#8217;re focused on continuing to do that. This will help us compete on both Saturday and Sunday, and ultimately close the gap to the front.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director</strong></p>\n<p>\"Qualifying wasn&#8217;t an easy session; there were a few bands of rain coming through that kept us on our toes. In those conditions, it&#8217;s easy to get a car knocked out along the way but we have both well in the top 10. It&#8217;s frustrating to be on the wrong side of a tight bunch today, but the gap to pole is a big improvement on Friday.</p>\n<p>\"Our long run pace looked good yesterday, so we&#8217;re hoping to be able to push forward. We also haven&#8217;t made any changes to the car that should hurt that race pace. We&#8217;d prefer to be starting further up as it would certainly help our chances of getting on the podium, but there are still opportunities on strategy that will allow us to offset. Whether McLaren have the race pace to match their qualifying speed will influence the strategy significantly. It&#8217;s going to be an interesting Grand Prix as there could be plenty of cars in the battle for the podium.\"</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"NORTHAMPTON, ENGLAND - JULY 08: George Russell of Great Britain driving the (63) Mercedes AMG\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        Mercedes finished behind Verstappen&#8217;s Red Bull, the McLarens and the Ferraris\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <h3>Aston Martin</h3>\n<p>After dropping down the order in Austria, it was more of the same for Aston Martin during qualifying at Silverstone, with Fernando Alonso making it through to Q3 and placing ninth, while Lance Stroll dropped out in Q2 en route to 12th, having been involved in a squabble for track position with Alpine rival Esteban Ocon.</p>\n<p><strong>Fernando Alonso, 9th, 1:27.659</strong></p>\n<p>\"It's not the Qualifying we wanted in what was a challenging session in drying conditions. There is still a long race ahead of us tomorrow and our Sunday pace is normally a strong point of this car.</p>\n<p>\"We still achieved another Q3 result, but we need to keep understanding our car at different circuits. The weather tomorrow may also be changeable, as it was today, so we need to remain focused and see what we can do in race conditions.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Lance Stroll, 12th, 1:28.935</strong></p>\n<p>\"I think more was possible in Qualifying today. The red flag forced us to run a third set of tyres in Q1, which meant we didn&#8217;t have a new set in Q2 and that put us on the back foot in comparison to others.</p>\n<p>\"It's a long race tomorrow and the AMR23 is feeling good, so I'll be doing my best to fight through the pack and put on a good show for the home fans.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Mike Krack, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>\"One of the most challenging Qualifying sessions of the year so far with a drying track, the constant threat of rain, and a red flag just before the end of Q1.</p>\n<p>\"Overall we missed the absolute pace to be fighting for the top positions today so we need to review things, understand where we can find more performance, and take those learnings going forward. We will try to come back stronger tomorrow in front of the passionate British fans who will be out in force.\"</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"NORTHAMPTON, ENGLAND - JULY 08: Fernando Alonso of Spain driving the (14) Aston Martin AMR23\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        Alonso led the Aston Martin charge but could do no more than ninth\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <h3>Ferrari</h3>\n<p>Ferrari ended the first day of practice hot on the heels of Red Bull, with Carlos Sainz only marginally slower than Max Verstappen. But the mixed qualifying session yielded only fourth and fifth, with McLaren pair Norris and Piastri making the most of the tricky conditions to slot ahead of the SF-23s &#8211; Charles Leclerc bouncing back from missing FP2 with a technical problem to edge out Sainz.</p>\n<p><strong>Charles Leclerc, 4th, 1:27.136</strong></p>\n<p>\"A pretty good qualifying, considering that I struggled a bit in the last few races in mixed conditions on slick tyres. I felt good today, because it seems that the hard work I&#8217;ve put in to improve this has paid off. I didn&#8217;t put the perfect lap together in Q3 as I lost grip in turn 15, so a front row position was not possible today.</p>\n<p>\"It&#8217;s nice to see McLaren be so quick and I expect an exciting race tomorrow with all of us so close together. We don&#8217;t have any race trim data on my side because I missed out on FP2, but we maximised every session since then and are in a decent starting position, so everything is possible tomorrow.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Carlos Sainz, 5th, 1:27.148</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was not a bad Saturday overall after a very challenging Quali. The field was very tight and the conditions were changing all the time, so to produce a solid session like we did was not easy.</p>\n<p>\"Tomorrow we can expect a nice battle with the cars around us so I expect an intense race. We&#8217;ll give absolutely everything to bring home a good result.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Vasseur, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>\"All three parts of qualifying were very exciting for the fans and spectators. It was good for Formula 1, good for the show. For our part, it was a bit so-so, even if we are in front of our direct competitors. But there was room to do better as Charles made a slight mistake in turn 15 which affected his lap time. What is important is that we are not far off the pace.</p>\n<p>\"We are still trying to be more consistent with regard to tyre degradation and we saw at the last two races, at very different tracks, that we have made a good step with this. Silverstone is a more demanding circuit in this regard and on paper, it did not look as though it would suit us, but we have been competitive and we can try and move up the order tomorrow. It&#8217;s hard to know what to expect from the weather: it changes every hour and the race lasts two hours! But we are very motivated.\"</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"NORTHAMPTON, ENGLAND - JULY 08: Sparks fly behind Charles Leclerc of Monaco driving the (16)\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        Leclerc finished ahead of Sainz despite missing FP2 with technical trouble\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <h3>Alpine</h3>\n<p>Like Aston Martin, Alpine got one car into Q3 and saw the other eliminated in Q2. With Ocon hindered by that aforementioned incident involving the green machine of Stroll, it was Pierre Gasly who finished as the fastest of the Enstone drivers, rounding out the top 10 in the pole position shootout.</p>\n<p><strong>Esteban Ocon, 13th, 1:28.956</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a frustrating day and a missed opportunity for us in Qualifying. It&#8217;s always disappointing not to make Q3, especially as we had the pace to do so. The conditions were not easy but we had been managing it very well. In Q2, it was not an ideal start to my final push lap as I braked on the wet side of the track alongside Lance [Stroll] and then spent my lap behind Charles [Leclerc], which cost us time. There are plenty of things for us to review from today, however, I&#8217;m feeling ready to make up some ground in tomorrow&#8217;s race.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Pierre Gasly, 10th, 1:27.689</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;That was a very challenging Qualifying to manage with the varying conditions. That said, when it is like that it&#8217;s often very exciting on-track and it certainly was enjoyable at the wheel. While I&#8217;m pleased to be in Q3 again, I&#8217;m disappointed we weren&#8217;t able to qualify any higher up than tenth place. We know the areas where we are lacking performance and we have to keep pushing hard as a team to find improvements to our package. Tomorrow, we will give it our all. The start of the race is going to be critical to make up some places and I&#8217;m confident we can come away with points on the board.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Alan Permane, Sporting Director</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all disappointed with today&#8217;s Qualifying performance as the minimum target, as always for us, is to have both cars well inside Q3. The weather and conditions proved tricky and it was all about being on track at the right time. We managed that well on both sides of the garage to advance through Q1 where all drivers found significant lap time improvement after the first red flag. Esteban did not progress further than Q2 while Pierre was able to reach Q3. There was probably a small amount of lap time left on the table for Pierre in a very tight session. We have a lot of work ahead of us if we&#8217;re to have both cars inside the top ten tomorrow. It&#8217;s usually a long, tough race here and we have every confidence that we can have a strong afternoon.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"NORTHAMPTON, ENGLAND - JULY 07: Pierre Gasly of Alpine and France  during practice ahead of the F1\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        Alpine were on the fringes of the top 10 positions during qualifying\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <h3>McLaren</h3>\n<p>After a tough start to the season, McLaren appeared to take a significant step forward with major updates on Lando Norris&#8217; car in Austria. With the new parts fitted to both the Briton and Oscar Piastri&#8217;s chrome-liveried machines this weekend at Silverstone, they doubled down on that performance with a stunning run to second and third in qualifying, launching into contention in the mixed conditions that they have excelled in in recent times.</p>\n<p><strong>Lando Norris, 2nd, 1:26.961</strong></p>\n<p>\"That was close! Two-tenths to P1 in Q3, is pretty insane. My last lap was a good lap. I could hear Zak on the radio on the in-lap, which is the best thing ever. I&#8217;m grateful. For us to achieve second and third is pretty amazing for the whole team, with all the hard work that we've been putting in, especially to do it here in Silverstone. To do that with the chrome livery at our home race, for the team, for myself, is amazing. Big thanks to the whole crowd here, they&#8217;re amazing. It's been a very special day for us. I look forward to tomorrow.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Oscar Piastri, 3rd, 1:27.092</strong></p>\n<p>\"I&#8217;m very, very, very happy. I mean, what a qualifying session. The car was a rocket ship in Q2 and Q3, I feel like I put a pretty good lap together. It&#8217;s a massive result for the team and the hard work that&#8217;s gone into bringing upgrades to the car. To have both of us up here is a mega result. Now we've just got to try and stay there for tomorrow. We know that will be a challenge, but we&#8217;re looking forward to it.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Andrea Stella, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>\"It&#8217;s great to see two McLarens up towards the top of the qualifying standings here at Silverstone. P2 and P3 has been achieved in tricky conditions today: the team had to be switched-on to get us through the first two sessions. We could then capitalise on that with strong laps from Lando and Oscar in Q3. A big positive is that we could confirm the progress we saw in Austria and the further upgrades we brought here. For that, I have to thank everyone at the factory and here trackside for their hard work, commitment and dedication. We have an incredible team, and we should enjoy today and use this as extra motivation going forward. We now focus on preparing for the race and look forward to tomorrow. We are realistic for the race as we know we have quick cars around us, but we will give our best in tomorrow&#8217;s British Grand Prix.\"</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"NORTHAMPTON, ENGLAND - JULY 08: Second placed qualifier Lando Norris of Great Britain and McLaren\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        It was a brilliant day at Silverstone for McLaren duo Norris and Piastri\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <h3>Haas</h3>\n<p>Haas came close to getting a car into Q3 with Nico Hulkenberg&#8217;s run to 11th, but that was the limit for the team on an otherwise challenging day. Indeed, Kevin Magnussen wound up 20th and last after his VF-23 ground to a halt and brought out the red flags in Q1, leaving him with a lonely walk back to the pits. He will start 19th thanks to Bottas' disqualification.</p>\n<p><strong>Nico Hulkenberg, 11th, 1:28.896</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was tricky obviously with the damp and wet patches, it&#8217;s quite sketchy, and it can go wrong but it didn&#8217;t. I think it was a good qualifying and I feel like I squeezed everything out of it. It was close with Alpine but not having DRS actually hurt us quite a bit. I think we&#8217;re a bit more &#8216;draggy&#8217; and have more downforce than other cars, so missing DRS wasn&#8217;t ideal for us.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Magnussen, 19th, 1:32.378</strong></p>\n<p>\"It just doesn&#8217;t seem to be my year this one so far, but this is where you show experience, stay cool and keep fighting. Everything switched off in the car, I had no power steering, nothing, I don&#8217;t know what it was in Q1. Until that point it felt good compared to the rest of the weekend, I was on a decent lap to improve there &#8211; on the one I stopped. There was still time on the clock so I don&#8217;t know if that would have been the last one.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Guenther Steiner, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>\"Due to the changing conditions, it was very difficult to read into FP3. We did what we wanted to do but we took no conclusions from it because of the variable conditions, between the weather, track surface, and everything else. We knew that though and we tried a few things, and they went well. We just missed out on Q3 in qualifying, just by a bit, as Nico was very close behind a car in the very fast sector and obviously that&#8217;s not good, especially with our car. With Kevin, we had an issue with the oil system, we lost all the oil, but hopefully the engine isn&#8217;t damaged.\"</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"NORTHAMPTON, ENGLAND - JULY 08: Kevin Magnussen of Denmark and Haas F1 climbs from his car after\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        Magnussen triggered a red flag when he stopped out on track in Q1\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <h3>Alfa Romeo</h3>\n<p>Alfa Romeo pair Valtteri Bottas and Zhou Guanyu were encouraged by the early signs from the upgrade package the team unleashed this weekend, but they had little to celebrate after qualifying. Bottas placed 11th in Q1, but could not participate in Q2 after he parked up at the side of the track, leaving him 15th. He was later disqualified from qualified after his car couldn't provide a fuel sample, leaving him 20th. Zhou, meanwhile, could do no more than 18th on the damp track surface but was elevated a position thanks to his team mate's disqualification.</p>\n<p><strong>Valtteri Bottas, 20th, 1:29.798</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s results are very disappointing, as it seemed we actually had a real chance to make it into the top ten. I started to lose power on the final inlap, and then the engine stopped. We eventually figured out it was a technical issue with fuel in the car, and we are already working to address that and make sure it doesn&#8217;t happen again. Sadly, this means we&#8217;ll be starting at the back of the grid in the race, which is not where we would have deserved to be looking at our pace. Still, tomorrow will be a long day and, as always, the weather could add one more element of unpredictability: the car felt better than yesterday, and we have slightly better pace compared to previous events, so our aim will be to make the most out of it and fight as hard as we can through the field.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Zhou Guanyu, 17th, 1:30.123</strong></p>\n<p>\"I think we had the potential to improve our performance this weekend, but unfortunately, today has been quite tricky for our team and we couldn&#8217;t maximise our chances. I had no running time during the final practice session because of a technical issue that the team promptly investigated and addressed, allowing me to get back on track ahead of qualifying. There, too, my running chances were limited, and I struggled with finding enough grip, eventually getting only one timed lap which wasn&#8217;t enough to make it through to Q2. We are of course disappointed not to have had an actual shot at moving forward, but our main aim now will be to regroup and come prepared ahead of tomorrow.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Alessandro Alunni Bravi, Team Representative</strong></p>\n<p>\"We are undoubtedly disappointed, as we felt more than on previous days that we had the potential to do well. With Valtteri we showed we were comfortably into Q2, but a technical issue related to fuel forced him to stop, and to pull out of qualifying. Unfortunately, the problem meant we weren&#8217;t able to submit the required fuel sample to the scrutineers, which lead to Valtteri being disqualified from the session. It&#8217;s a pity as he had been doing an excellent job, and we are sorry to see his chances of a good qualifying session seriously damaged. For Zhou, it has been more difficult: he completely sat out of FP3 because of a car issue, and then wasn&#8217;t able to move into Q2. It is in moments like these that the team needs to regroup and stick together, and push each other to further improve; we must aim to execute a better weekend. Tomorrow will be challenging, but we are not letting our heads down after today&#8217;s result: we&#8217;ll be ready to do our job, and carry out a good race to allow us to recover the ground we have lost.\"</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"NORTHAMPTON, ENGLAND - JULY 08: Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        Bottas was another to suffer a qualifying stoppage, parking up at the side of the track in Q2\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <h3>Williams</h3>\n<p>Williams showed plenty of promise on Friday and, while they moved to play down their expectations, Alex Albon converted it to take a fine eighth in qualifying &#8211; surviving an early scare in Q1 when the conditions were at their most precarious. Logan Sargeant could not join him in Q3 after seeing two of his lap times deleted during the Q2 phase for exceeding track limits.</p>\n<p><strong>Logan Sargeant, 14th, 1:29.031</strong></p>\n<p>\"For me, the first goal of this weekend was to get into Q2, and I achieved that. It was a tricky session all in all. We can&#8217;t catch a break from mixed conditions at the moment. We knew it was going to be a lot closer coming into qualifying than we saw in practice. It&#8217;s a shame that I didn&#8217;t have a new set of tyres at the end of Q2 as I think that probably cost us the chance of transferring to Q3. At the end of the day, the car was in a good place and we&#8217;re making steps in the right direction. I&#8217;m happy with the steps that I&#8217;m making this weekend. I still have plenty of steps to take which is clear to me. As long as I&#8217;m moving in the right direction that&#8217;s the positive part and we can build off that to have a good race tomorrow. It won&#8217;t be easy starting 14th with a lot of quick cars around us but we&#8217;ll do our best.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Alex Albon, 8th, 1:27.530</strong></p>\n<p>\"It&#8217;s been an amazing weekend but it&#8217;s funny when you finish in Q3, with P8 and you&#8217;re disappointed.We have to be realistic but it&#8217;s been great so far. In Qualifying, the session was going quite smoothly but, as the track dried out, corner speeds picked up and track evolution came in. We started to get quite a bit of degradation through the lap, even front deg, so we need to go away and understand that but, by the time I got to Q3, I was struggling a little bit with those combined factors. We&#8217;ve been really on top of it since the start of the weekend and I got into rhythm very quickly and adapted well to the changes, so we really hit the ground running. I think we ended up where we expected to be but I think if you told us we&#8217;d be here at the beginning of the weekend, we wouldn&#8217;t believe you.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Dave Robson, Head of Vehicle Performance</strong></p>\n<p>\"Today was exceptionally difficult with mixed and varying conditions throughout the day. We timed the run on Soft tyres well in FP3; whilst this allowed us to learn quite a lot about the car, it gave us a position on the timesheet that flattered our true pace. However, both drivers were still happy with the car balance and comfortable going into qualifying.</p>\n<p>\"Qualifying was a rollercoaster with both Alex and Logan struggling to get a representative lap done around the showers in Q1. The red flag allowed us to reset and both showed excellent pace and composure to deliver very good laps under pressure. Q2 was much calmer for Alex and he was very quick in comfortably making Q3. Logan found the conditions a little more difficult and had to do his final lap on a more used set from Q1, which cost him the couple of tenths that he needed to progress. Alex was very strong on the used Soft at the beginning of Q3 but couldn&#8217;t quite find the final bit of grip as the track dried. Nonetheless, it was a potentially very difficult qualifying session and we dealt with it well and have both cars in a useful position for the Grand Prix tomorrow as a result.\"</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"NORTHAMPTON, ENGLAND - JULY 08: Alexander Albon of Thailand and Williams prepares to drive in the\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        Albon gave the home fans even more to cheer about with his qualifying display\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <h3>AlphaTauri</h3>\n<p>AlphaTauri were the only team to lose both cars in Q1 at Silverstone, with Yuki Tsunoda winding up 17th and Nyck de Vries placing 19th, ahead of only the sidelined Magnussen. Both moved up a place thanks to Bottas' disqualification but it leaves the Italian team &#8211; now last in the constructors&#8217; standings &#8211; with plenty of work to do if they are to claim points on Sunday.</p>\n<p><strong>Nyck de Vries, 18th, 1:30.513</strong></p>\n<p>\"I ended up very close to Q2 again, it&#8217;s frustrating and a shame, but I&#8217;m happy with my performance. Track evolution was high and almost fully dry in the end, but the team did a good job with the strategy. We tried many different things with the new upgrade, and compared to yesterday, the car felt better. I feel more support in the places I need, especially in the low-speed corners, and more rotation in the high-speed corners, which we were aiming for. There is room for improvement, but we&#8217;re still trying to understand the car&#8217;s behaviour more. I reset myself and do whatever I can tomorrow to extract as much performance from the car and finish as high as possible.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Yuki Tsunoda, 16th, 1:30.025</strong></p>\n<p>\"Today&#8217;s qualifying was a very tricky session, with changing conditions as the rain was coming. We did a decent lap at the beginning of qualifying, but towards the end, when it became a one-lap shootout, my tyres were very cold. I didn&#8217;t have the confidence and temperature to push and attack as required, making a mistake in the last corner where I out braked myself and went deep, losing a lot of time there. During the session, we were more competitive and in the mix, so I feel our final lap wasn&#8217;t entirely representative. In these changing conditions, we maybe didn&#8217;t put it together when it mattered. We did some long runs in practice, but it&#8217;s certainly not going to be easy tomorrow. A big part of the track is high-speed, so it&#8217;s difficult to overtake and follow, so a little rain is welcome because it might bring some opportunities.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Jonathan Eddolls, Chief Race Engineer</strong></p>\n<p>\"The run programme for both cars in Q1 was smooth, with the right tyres fitted, the right sequence of push and cool laps being adopted, and the timing to box for a new set sensible. However, the red flag disrupted things and unfortunately, the final runs were not good enough. Frustratingly, Yuki was very close to making the cut for Q2, but due to a snap during brake entry, he lost a little time during turn 16. Nyck was further away with his final run, so we need to look into the data to understand what happened. Our starting positions make things more difficult for the race, but we&#8217;ll be fully focused on being ready to take any opportunities which allow us to move forwards with both cars tomorrow.\"</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"NORTHAMPTON, ENGLAND - JULY 08: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        AlphaTauri suffered a double Q1 exit with Tsunoda and De Vries\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <h3>Pirelli</h3>\n<p><strong>Mario Isola, Motorsport Director</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was a busy, exciting and interesting day, as is often the case when track conditions keep changing rapidly. In the last free practice session, we saw drivers mainly doing laps with a low fuel load: the few who tried to gather data on tyre behaviour over a longer distance, running with more fuel on board, did not have much time to do so as the rain arrived. But this did allow them to learn more about the intermediate tyre and to calculate the crossover time to slicks (112%) on a demanding track like Silverstone and from the comments we have received from the teams and drivers, everything seems to be in line with expectations, both in terms of warm-up and car balance.</p>\n<p>\"Track conditions improved rapidly throughout qualifying as it gradually dried out, with the order changing constantly right up to the chequered flag. Everyone used the Soft tyres and the C3 proved to have excellent warm-up, even though air and track temperatures were considerably lower than yesterday&#8217;s, also considering that drivers chose to wait several minutes for the green light, sitting in the fast lane in the pits, therefore without the benefit of the blankets.</p>\n<p>\"Tomorrow&#8217;s race should be run in the dry, although the forecast here is traditionally a bit haphazard. In terms of strategy, the C3 presents itself more and more as a viable choice and so a two-stop is probably the quickest option. That means we can expect to see different choices between the teams leading to more excitement and uncertainty.\"</p>\n\n    </div>",
            "text": "Red Bull It was a mixed day at Red Bull, for while Max Verstappen charged to yet another pole position \u2013 his fifth in a row and seventh of the season so far \u2013 team mate Sergio Perez dropped out in Q1 to continue his painful qualifying run. The Mexican later gained a position after Valtteri Bottas was disqualified. It means Verstappen is likely to be fighting the McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri by himself during Sunday\u2019s Grand Prix. Max Verstappen, 1st, 1:26.720 \"It was quite a crazy qualifying, very hectic and slippery in some places. I had a little \u2018inchident\u2019 in the pit lane, I understeered as I turned and the car just went straight - I think there was quite a bit of damage. That aside, very happy. Equally, I\u2019m very happy for McLaren, you could see how excited everyone was in that garage, they\u2019ve worked so hard, it\u2019s also great for the British fans too. I\u2019m expecting the Ferraris and Mercedes to be more competitive during the race. As for us, we know that we have a good race car and I\u2019m already looking forward to it. I don\u2019t mind if it\u2019s wet tomorrow, in FP3 we were very fast in the wet so I don\u2019t think we need to worry.\" Sergio Perez, 15th, 1:29.968 \"Today was quite disappointing. The red flag lasted a lot longer than we initially thought it would so we lost some heat on the tyres and couldn\u2019t get enough temperature back into them. We also struggled with the weather. The changing conditions made things a lot trickier, so we ended up having a poor qualifying. We had a good session yesterday so, for now, we need to look forward to tomorrow and just aim to get any many points as possible. It\u2019s going to be difficult to come through the field but we will try our very best.\" Christian Horner, Team Principal \"A mixed bag from qualifying today. The weather was about as British as it gets; raining while sunny. This complicated things for us slightly but it looks like the race will be dryer so we won\u2019t have to flip flop between inters and slicks as we have done today. The change in conditions means we won\u2019t be able to take a lot of the data from practice with us but we will certainly take the pole from qualifying. \"It was another great performance from Max, his 5th pole in a row. Conversely, another tough quali for Checo but remaining confident for a good run tomorrow with plenty to race for.\"\n\nPole went to Verstappen and Red Bull in a wet-dry qualifying at Silverstone\n\nMercedes Mercedes had a quiet start to their British Grand Prix weekend, and while qualifying brought an improvement, George Russell and Lewis Hamilton (after a wild spin in Q1) had to settle for sixth and seventh on the grid. Starting just behind the Ferraris, there could be quite a battle between the red and black cars on race day. Lewis Hamilton, 7th, 1:27.211 \"We weren\u2019t quite quick enough today unfortunately. The conditions were tricky out there but there was still an element of fun to it, as we tried to get on top of the tyres. There were some moments where it looked like we had the potential to challenge further forward, but then we fell back a little. We seem to struggle on the single lap more than we do on the race pace, so we will see what we can do tomorrow. If we can progress forward, then that would be amazing. Hopefully we can put some pressure on the cars ahead and get into a battle with them.\" George Russell, 6th, 1:27.155 \"It was an exciting session; I really enjoy these conditions. I\u2019m always confident that I can do a good job and put the laps in when needed. It was stressful at times, but I felt comfortable with our pace in Q1 and Q2. My last lap in Q3 was strong, but it was frustrating to see how close we were to being a couple of positions further forward. I was a little bit disappointed not to achieve this but we\u2019re in a decent place for tomorrow. The Team did a good job of improving the car overnight and I\u2019m excited to see what we can do in the Grand Prix. We believe we have stronger race pace than on the single lap, so I\u2019m confident that we can move forward. \"Once again, the energy from the fans today has been amazing. You really feel the support from the stands and it\u2019s incredible to see how they are backing the Team and us as drivers. It\u2019s a special weekend and we can hopefully do a good job tomorrow and challenge for the podium.\" Toto Wolff, Team Principal and CEO \"It was an interesting session today, with the gap between P2 and P7 only a few tenths. We were more competitive than we thought we might be in terms of lap time, and the gap to the front-row is small. That is not an excuse though and P6 and P7 are the positions we are in. The question for us now is how much pace differential you need in order to overtake. There are several cars ahead of us but we\u2019re hopeful we can make some good progress. \"Whilst it\u2019s frustrating in one sense, it's also encouraging to see the lap time gains that others have found, including McLaren recently. It\u2019s a good example of how you can add performance during the season. We\u2019ve been able to do so ourselves and we\u2019re focused on continuing to do that. This will help us compete on both Saturday and Sunday, and ultimately close the gap to the front.\" Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director \"Qualifying wasn\u2019t an easy session; there were a few bands of rain coming through that kept us on our toes. In those conditions, it\u2019s easy to get a car knocked out along the way but we have both well in the top 10. It\u2019s frustrating to be on the wrong side of a tight bunch today, but the gap to pole is a big improvement on Friday. \"Our long run pace looked good yesterday, so we\u2019re hoping to be able to push forward. We also haven\u2019t made any changes to the car that should hurt that race pace. We\u2019d prefer to be starting further up as it would certainly help our chances of getting on the podium, but there are still opportunities on strategy that will allow us to offset. Whether McLaren have the race pace to match their qualifying speed will influence the strategy significantly. It\u2019s going to be an interesting Grand Prix as there could be plenty of cars in the battle for the podium.\"\n\nMercedes finished behind Verstappen\u2019s Red Bull, the McLarens and the Ferraris\n\nAston Martin After dropping down the order in Austria, it was more of the same for Aston Martin during qualifying at Silverstone, with Fernando Alonso making it through to Q3 and placing ninth, while Lance Stroll dropped out in Q2 en route to 12th, having been involved in a squabble for track position with Alpine rival Esteban Ocon. Fernando Alonso, 9th, 1:27.659 \"It's not the Qualifying we wanted in what was a challenging session in drying conditions. There is still a long race ahead of us tomorrow and our Sunday pace is normally a strong point of this car. \"We still achieved another Q3 result, but we need to keep understanding our car at different circuits. The weather tomorrow may also be changeable, as it was today, so we need to remain focused and see what we can do in race conditions.\" Lance Stroll, 12th, 1:28.935 \"I think more was possible in Qualifying today. The red flag forced us to run a third set of tyres in Q1, which meant we didn\u2019t have a new set in Q2 and that put us on the back foot in comparison to others. \"It's a long race tomorrow and the AMR23 is feeling good, so I'll be doing my best to fight through the pack and put on a good show for the home fans.\" Mike Krack, Team Principal \"One of the most challenging Qualifying sessions of the year so far with a drying track, the constant threat of rain, and a red flag just before the end of Q1. \"Overall we missed the absolute pace to be fighting for the top positions today so we need to review things, understand where we can find more performance, and take those learnings going forward. We will try to come back stronger tomorrow in front of the passionate British fans who will be out in force.\"\n\nAlonso led the Aston Martin charge but could do no more than ninth\n\nFerrari Ferrari ended the first day of practice hot on the heels of Red Bull, with Carlos Sainz only marginally slower than Max Verstappen. But the mixed qualifying session yielded only fourth and fifth, with McLaren pair Norris and Piastri making the most of the tricky conditions to slot ahead of the SF-23s \u2013 Charles Leclerc bouncing back from missing FP2 with a technical problem to edge out Sainz. Charles Leclerc, 4th, 1:27.136 \"A pretty good qualifying, considering that I struggled a bit in the last few races in mixed conditions on slick tyres. I felt good today, because it seems that the hard work I\u2019ve put in to improve this has paid off. I didn\u2019t put the perfect lap together in Q3 as I lost grip in turn 15, so a front row position was not possible today. \"It\u2019s nice to see McLaren be so quick and I expect an exciting race tomorrow with all of us so close together. We don\u2019t have any race trim data on my side because I missed out on FP2, but we maximised every session since then and are in a decent starting position, so everything is possible tomorrow.\" Carlos Sainz, 5th, 1:27.148 \"It was not a bad Saturday overall after a very challenging Quali. The field was very tight and the conditions were changing all the time, so to produce a solid session like we did was not easy. \"Tomorrow we can expect a nice battle with the cars around us so I expect an intense race. We\u2019ll give absolutely everything to bring home a good result.\" Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Vasseur, Team Principal \"All three parts of qualifying were very exciting for the fans and spectators. It was good for Formula 1, good for the show. For our part, it was a bit so-so, even if we are in front of our direct competitors. But there was room to do better as Charles made a slight mistake in turn 15 which affected his lap time. What is important is that we are not far off the pace. \"We are still trying to be more consistent with regard to tyre degradation and we saw at the last two races, at very different tracks, that we have made a good step with this. Silverstone is a more demanding circuit in this regard and on paper, it did not look as though it would suit us, but we have been competitive and we can try and move up the order tomorrow. It\u2019s hard to know what to expect from the weather: it changes every hour and the race lasts two hours! But we are very motivated.\"\n\nLeclerc finished ahead of Sainz despite missing FP2 with technical trouble\n\nAlpine Like Aston Martin, Alpine got one car into Q3 and saw the other eliminated in Q2. With Ocon hindered by that aforementioned incident involving the green machine of Stroll, it was Pierre Gasly who finished as the fastest of the Enstone drivers, rounding out the top 10 in the pole position shootout. Esteban Ocon, 13th, 1:28.956 \u201cIt\u2019s been a frustrating day and a missed opportunity for us in Qualifying. It\u2019s always disappointing not to make Q3, especially as we had the pace to do so. The conditions were not easy but we had been managing it very well. In Q2, it was not an ideal start to my final push lap as I braked on the wet side of the track alongside Lance [Stroll] and then spent my lap behind Charles [Leclerc], which cost us time. There are plenty of things for us to review from today, however, I\u2019m feeling ready to make up some ground in tomorrow\u2019s race.\u201d Pierre Gasly, 10th, 1:27.689 \u201cThat was a very challenging Qualifying to manage with the varying conditions. That said, when it is like that it\u2019s often very exciting on-track and it certainly was enjoyable at the wheel. While I\u2019m pleased to be in Q3 again, I\u2019m disappointed we weren\u2019t able to qualify any higher up than tenth place. We know the areas where we are lacking performance and we have to keep pushing hard as a team to find improvements to our package. Tomorrow, we will give it our all. The start of the race is going to be critical to make up some places and I\u2019m confident we can come away with points on the board.\u201d Alan Permane, Sporting Director \u201cWe\u2019re all disappointed with today\u2019s Qualifying performance as the minimum target, as always for us, is to have both cars well inside Q3. The weather and conditions proved tricky and it was all about being on track at the right time. We managed that well on both sides of the garage to advance through Q1 where all drivers found significant lap time improvement after the first red flag. Esteban did not progress further than Q2 while Pierre was able to reach Q3. There was probably a small amount of lap time left on the table for Pierre in a very tight session. We have a lot of work ahead of us if we\u2019re to have both cars inside the top ten tomorrow. It\u2019s usually a long, tough race here and we have every confidence that we can have a strong afternoon.\u201d\n\nAlpine were on the fringes of the top 10 positions during qualifying\n\nMcLaren After a tough start to the season, McLaren appeared to take a significant step forward with major updates on Lando Norris\u2019 car in Austria. With the new parts fitted to both the Briton and Oscar Piastri\u2019s chrome-liveried machines this weekend at Silverstone, they doubled down on that performance with a stunning run to second and third in qualifying, launching into contention in the mixed conditions that they have excelled in in recent times. Lando Norris, 2nd, 1:26.961 \"That was close! Two-tenths to P1 in Q3, is pretty insane. My last lap was a good lap. I could hear Zak on the radio on the in-lap, which is the best thing ever. I\u2019m grateful. For us to achieve second and third is pretty amazing for the whole team, with all the hard work that we've been putting in, especially to do it here in Silverstone. To do that with the chrome livery at our home race, for the team, for myself, is amazing. Big thanks to the whole crowd here, they\u2019re amazing. It's been a very special day for us. I look forward to tomorrow.\" Oscar Piastri, 3rd, 1:27.092 \"I\u2019m very, very, very happy. I mean, what a qualifying session. The car was a rocket ship in Q2 and Q3, I feel like I put a pretty good lap together. It\u2019s a massive result for the team and the hard work that\u2019s gone into bringing upgrades to the car. To have both of us up here is a mega result. Now we've just got to try and stay there for tomorrow. We know that will be a challenge, but we\u2019re looking forward to it.\" Andrea Stella, Team Principal \"It\u2019s great to see two McLarens up towards the top of the qualifying standings here at Silverstone. P2 and P3 has been achieved in tricky conditions today: the team had to be switched-on to get us through the first two sessions. We could then capitalise on that with strong laps from Lando and Oscar in Q3. A big positive is that we could confirm the progress we saw in Austria and the further upgrades we brought here. For that, I have to thank everyone at the factory and here trackside for their hard work, commitment and dedication. We have an incredible team, and we should enjoy today and use this as extra motivation going forward. We now focus on preparing for the race and look forward to tomorrow. We are realistic for the race as we know we have quick cars around us, but we will give our best in tomorrow\u2019s British Grand Prix.\"\n\nIt was a brilliant day at Silverstone for McLaren duo Norris and Piastri\n\nHaas Haas came close to getting a car into Q3 with Nico Hulkenberg\u2019s run to 11th, but that was the limit for the team on an otherwise challenging day. Indeed, Kevin Magnussen wound up 20th and last after his VF-23 ground to a halt and brought out the red flags in Q1, leaving him with a lonely walk back to the pits. He will start 19th thanks to Bottas' disqualification. Nico Hulkenberg, 11th, 1:28.896 \"It was tricky obviously with the damp and wet patches, it\u2019s quite sketchy, and it can go wrong but it didn\u2019t. I think it was a good qualifying and I feel like I squeezed everything out of it. It was close with Alpine but not having DRS actually hurt us quite a bit. I think we\u2019re a bit more \u2018draggy\u2019 and have more downforce than other cars, so missing DRS wasn\u2019t ideal for us.\" Kevin Magnussen, 19th, 1:32.378 \"It just doesn\u2019t seem to be my year this one so far, but this is where you show experience, stay cool and keep fighting. Everything switched off in the car, I had no power steering, nothing, I don\u2019t know what it was in Q1. Until that point it felt good compared to the rest of the weekend, I was on a decent lap to improve there \u2013 on the one I stopped. There was still time on the clock so I don\u2019t know if that would have been the last one.\" Guenther Steiner, Team Principal \"Due to the changing conditions, it was very difficult to read into FP3. We did what we wanted to do but we took no conclusions from it because of the variable conditions, between the weather, track surface, and everything else. We knew that though and we tried a few things, and they went well. We just missed out on Q3 in qualifying, just by a bit, as Nico was very close behind a car in the very fast sector and obviously that\u2019s not good, especially with our car. With Kevin, we had an issue with the oil system, we lost all the oil, but hopefully the engine isn\u2019t damaged.\"\n\nMagnussen triggered a red flag when he stopped out on track in Q1\n\nAlfa Romeo Alfa Romeo pair Valtteri Bottas and Zhou Guanyu were encouraged by the early signs from the upgrade package the team unleashed this weekend, but they had little to celebrate after qualifying. Bottas placed 11th in Q1, but could not participate in Q2 after he parked up at the side of the track, leaving him 15th. He was later disqualified from qualified after his car couldn't provide a fuel sample, leaving him 20th. Zhou, meanwhile, could do no more than 18th on the damp track surface but was elevated a position thanks to his team mate's disqualification. Valtteri Bottas, 20th, 1:29.798 \u201cToday\u2019s results are very disappointing, as it seemed we actually had a real chance to make it into the top ten. I started to lose power on the final inlap, and then the engine stopped. We eventually figured out it was a technical issue with fuel in the car, and we are already working to address that and make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. Sadly, this means we\u2019ll be starting at the back of the grid in the race, which is not where we would have deserved to be looking at our pace. Still, tomorrow will be a long day and, as always, the weather could add one more element of unpredictability: the car felt better than yesterday, and we have slightly better pace compared to previous events, so our aim will be to make the most out of it and fight as hard as we can through the field.\u201d Zhou Guanyu, 17th, 1:30.123 \"I think we had the potential to improve our performance this weekend, but unfortunately, today has been quite tricky for our team and we couldn\u2019t maximise our chances. I had no running time during the final practice session because of a technical issue that the team promptly investigated and addressed, allowing me to get back on track ahead of qualifying. There, too, my running chances were limited, and I struggled with finding enough grip, eventually getting only one timed lap which wasn\u2019t enough to make it through to Q2. We are of course disappointed not to have had an actual shot at moving forward, but our main aim now will be to regroup and come prepared ahead of tomorrow.\" Alessandro Alunni Bravi, Team Representative \"We are undoubtedly disappointed, as we felt more than on previous days that we had the potential to do well. With Valtteri we showed we were comfortably into Q2, but a technical issue related to fuel forced him to stop, and to pull out of qualifying. Unfortunately, the problem meant we weren\u2019t able to submit the required fuel sample to the scrutineers, which lead to Valtteri being disqualified from the session. It\u2019s a pity as he had been doing an excellent job, and we are sorry to see his chances of a good qualifying session seriously damaged. For Zhou, it has been more difficult: he completely sat out of FP3 because of a car issue, and then wasn\u2019t able to move into Q2. It is in moments like these that the team needs to regroup and stick together, and push each other to further improve; we must aim to execute a better weekend. Tomorrow will be challenging, but we are not letting our heads down after today\u2019s result: we\u2019ll be ready to do our job, and carry out a good race to allow us to recover the ground we have lost.\"\n\nBottas was another to suffer a qualifying stoppage, parking up at the side of the track in Q2\n\nWilliams Williams showed plenty of promise on Friday and, while they moved to play down their expectations, Alex Albon converted it to take a fine eighth in qualifying \u2013 surviving an early scare in Q1 when the conditions were at their most precarious. Logan Sargeant could not join him in Q3 after seeing two of his lap times deleted during the Q2 phase for exceeding track limits. Logan Sargeant, 14th, 1:29.031 \"For me, the first goal of this weekend was to get into Q2, and I achieved that. It was a tricky session all in all. We can\u2019t catch a break from mixed conditions at the moment. We knew it was going to be a lot closer coming into qualifying than we saw in practice. It\u2019s a shame that I didn\u2019t have a new set of tyres at the end of Q2 as I think that probably cost us the chance of transferring to Q3. At the end of the day, the car was in a good place and we\u2019re making steps in the right direction. I\u2019m happy with the steps that I\u2019m making this weekend. I still have plenty of steps to take which is clear to me. As long as I\u2019m moving in the right direction that\u2019s the positive part and we can build off that to have a good race tomorrow. It won\u2019t be easy starting 14th with a lot of quick cars around us but we\u2019ll do our best.\u201d Alex Albon, 8th, 1:27.530 \"It\u2019s been an amazing weekend but it\u2019s funny when you finish in Q3, with P8 and you\u2019re disappointed.We have to be realistic but it\u2019s been great so far. In Qualifying, the session was going quite smoothly but, as the track dried out, corner speeds picked up and track evolution came in. We started to get quite a bit of degradation through the lap, even front deg, so we need to go away and understand that but, by the time I got to Q3, I was struggling a little bit with those combined factors. We\u2019ve been really on top of it since the start of the weekend and I got into rhythm very quickly and adapted well to the changes, so we really hit the ground running. I think we ended up where we expected to be but I think if you told us we\u2019d be here at the beginning of the weekend, we wouldn\u2019t believe you.\" Dave Robson, Head of Vehicle Performance \"Today was exceptionally difficult with mixed and varying conditions throughout the day. We timed the run on Soft tyres well in FP3; whilst this allowed us to learn quite a lot about the car, it gave us a position on the timesheet that flattered our true pace. However, both drivers were still happy with the car balance and comfortable going into qualifying. \"Qualifying was a rollercoaster with both Alex and Logan struggling to get a representative lap done around the showers in Q1. The red flag allowed us to reset and both showed excellent pace and composure to deliver very good laps under pressure. Q2 was much calmer for Alex and he was very quick in comfortably making Q3. Logan found the conditions a little more difficult and had to do his final lap on a more used set from Q1, which cost him the couple of tenths that he needed to progress. Alex was very strong on the used Soft at the beginning of Q3 but couldn\u2019t quite find the final bit of grip as the track dried. Nonetheless, it was a potentially very difficult qualifying session and we dealt with it well and have both cars in a useful position for the Grand Prix tomorrow as a result.\"\n\nAlbon gave the home fans even more to cheer about with his qualifying display\n\nAlphaTauri AlphaTauri were the only team to lose both cars in Q1 at Silverstone, with Yuki Tsunoda winding up 17th and Nyck de Vries placing 19th, ahead of only the sidelined Magnussen. Both moved up a place thanks to Bottas' disqualification but it leaves the Italian team \u2013 now last in the constructors\u2019 standings \u2013 with plenty of work to do if they are to claim points on Sunday. Nyck de Vries, 18th, 1:30.513 \"I ended up very close to Q2 again, it\u2019s frustrating and a shame, but I\u2019m happy with my performance. Track evolution was high and almost fully dry in the end, but the team did a good job with the strategy. We tried many different things with the new upgrade, and compared to yesterday, the car felt better. I feel more support in the places I need, especially in the low-speed corners, and more rotation in the high-speed corners, which we were aiming for. There is room for improvement, but we\u2019re still trying to understand the car\u2019s behaviour more. I reset myself and do whatever I can tomorrow to extract as much performance from the car and finish as high as possible.\" Yuki Tsunoda, 16th, 1:30.025 \"Today\u2019s qualifying was a very tricky session, with changing conditions as the rain was coming. We did a decent lap at the beginning of qualifying, but towards the end, when it became a one-lap shootout, my tyres were very cold. I didn\u2019t have the confidence and temperature to push and attack as required, making a mistake in the last corner where I out braked myself and went deep, losing a lot of time there. During the session, we were more competitive and in the mix, so I feel our final lap wasn\u2019t entirely representative. In these changing conditions, we maybe didn\u2019t put it together when it mattered. We did some long runs in practice, but it\u2019s certainly not going to be easy tomorrow. A big part of the track is high-speed, so it\u2019s difficult to overtake and follow, so a little rain is welcome because it might bring some opportunities.\" Jonathan Eddolls, Chief Race Engineer \"The run programme for both cars in Q1 was smooth, with the right tyres fitted, the right sequence of push and cool laps being adopted, and the timing to box for a new set sensible. However, the red flag disrupted things and unfortunately, the final runs were not good enough. Frustratingly, Yuki was very close to making the cut for Q2, but due to a snap during brake entry, he lost a little time during turn 16. Nyck was further away with his final run, so we need to look into the data to understand what happened. Our starting positions make things more difficult for the race, but we\u2019ll be fully focused on being ready to take any opportunities which allow us to move forwards with both cars tomorrow.\"\n\nAlphaTauri suffered a double Q1 exit with Tsunoda and De Vries",

Eight of the 10 participating entrants &#8211; including MoneyGram Haas F1 Team &#8211; have either their headquarters or satellite operations in Britain, with many in close proximity to Silverstone.

It\u2019s extra track time, which is always valuable now as it\u2019s very limited this season with Sprints and almost no pre-season testing, so I\u2019m looking forward to sharing the day with Kev.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2023 WBTV.

All revenue and profit figures are displayed in U.S. dollars using the average daily exchange rate during the 2022 fiscal year: \u00a31 = $1.23 for UK teams and \u20ac1 = $1.05 for teams in Europe.\n\nMost teams have at least two dozen sponsorship partners with annual deal values that can range anywhere from low six-figures to more than $60 million a year for title sponsorships like Oracle (Red Bull) and Petronas (Mercedes). Haas earns $25 million annually from MoneyGram. Sponsorship revenue has soared for certain teams in recent years with the growth of the sport. At Aston Martin, it has increased 1,000% since Lawrence Stroll bought the team in 2018; it is expected to top $220 million this year.\n\nFormula 1 generates revenue from race promotion fees, media rights, sponsorship fees and ancillary sources, such as Paddock Club ticket sales and shipping cars and equipment outside of Europe. It distributes a portion of this revenue\u201445% in 2022\u2014to the teams based on a formula in the Concorde Agreement, which is the contract between the International Automobile Federation (FIA), Formula 1 Group and F1 teams that governs the sport. The most recent agreement was signed in 2020 and covers the seasons between 2021 and 2025. It was the first Concorde Agreement signed under Liberty Media\u2019s ownership of F1.\n\nThe 10 teams shared total prize money payments of $1.16 billion in 2022, up from $1.07 billion the prior year. The distributions consider the previous year finish by teams on the track in the Constructor standings, as well as the current year revenue of Formula 1. Title-winning teams and teams that finished in the top three over the past decade are eligible for additional payments. Ferrari gets an additional bonus that runs into the tens of millions of dollars because of its historical standing in the sport.\n\n\u201cScuderia Ferrari and Formula 1 have gone hand in hand since 1950, and we are happy that this relationship is set to continue for a long time, as it is part of the very DNA of this sport,\u201d Chase Carey, then-Formula 1 CEO, said when the Concorde Agreement was signed in 2020.\n\nTeams generate additional revenue from licensing, merchandise and related business, such as Mercedes\u2019 Applied Sciences division. That launched in 2019 to leverage its engineering expertise for clients such as the INEOS Britannia sailing team that races in the America\u2019s Cup competition.\n\nRevenue totals were subject to a team-specific multiplier, which remains the standard metric for valuing sports teams in transactions. Earnings can have dramatic fluctuations from year to year, and most F1 teams have had negative cash flow in recent years.\n\nThe team-specific multipliers were based on multiple factors, including historical sales, strength of brand, on-track performance (historical and recent) and infrastructure, as well as expected future team and F1 economics. Revenue multiples ranged from four (Haas) to six (Ferrari).\n\nValues for teams were converted to U.S. dollars based on the June 23 exchange rates of \u00a31 = $1.23 for UK teams and \u20ac1 = $1.05 for those based in continental Europe.\n\nOf the 10 F1 teams, more than half of them participated with Sportico by providing or validating information; the others did not comment or respond.",

(WBTV) - Round 10 of the 2023 FIA Formula 1 World Championship takes the Kannapolis-based MoneyGram Haas F1 Team to the Red Bull Ring, for the Austrian Grand Prix.</p><p class=\"text | article-text\">Austria made its first appearance in Formula 1 in 1964, at the unloved and featureless Zeltweg Airport, and when it made its full-scale championship return in 1970 it did so at the new &#214;sterreichring, a fast and undulating circuit in the hills above the village of Spielberg. Austria was a fixture on the schedule through 1987, before it disappeared, re-emerging from 1997 until 2003 at the shortened and rebranded A1-Ring.</p><p class=\"text | article-text\">Another absence followed, with the entire facility falling into a state of disrepair, before it was acquired and renovated by Red Bull. Formula 1 returned to Austria in 2014 at the renamed and refreshed Red Bull Ring. At just 4.3km, and with only 10 corners, it is one of the shortest circuits on the calendar, and with lap times of around 65 seconds Austria provides one of the closest qualifying sessions of the season.</p><p class=\"text | article-text\">For the fourth successive year there will be two &#8216;lights out&#8217; opportunities in Austria. The venue hosted back-to-back grands prix in both 2020 &#8211; including the delayed season-opening event &#8211; and 2021, due to the pandemic. Last season Austria returned to its single grand prix but hosted F1 Sprint. Once more the two-race format will feature this weekend, with separate qualifying sessions for the Sprint Race and the grand prix, as was first introduced in Baku in April. It will mark the second of six F1 Sprint events through the 2023 season.</p><p class=\"w-100\"></p><p class=\"text | article-text\">The Red Bull Ring brings back uplifting memories for MoneyGram Haas F1 Team. Its highest double finish of fourth and fifth came at the 2018 running of the event while last year both cars were classified inside the top eight in the grand prix. Fifth, in 2018, represents Kevin Magnussen&#8217;s best Austria finish while Nico Hulkenberg took a high of sixth in 2015, prior to capturing a front-row grid spot for 2016&#8242;s race.</p><p class=\"text | article-text\"><b>Guenther Steiner - Team Principal:</b></p><p class=\"text | article-text\"><b>The Canadian Grand Prix saw highs and lows for the team in both qualifying and the race. Having had a few days away to further analyze the weekend &#8211; what can you share about the VF-23&#8242;s characteristics where it&#8217;s capable of such good one-lap pace in Saturday qualifying, evidenced by multiple Q3 appearances, but then struggles to keep tires alive in race conditions on a Sunday.</b></p><p class=\"text | article-text\">&#8220;We&#8217;re investigating the very good performance we have in qualifying and not-so-good performance during the race at the moment. We&#8217;re trying to pinpoint it but for the next races we&#8217;re maybe going to try and find a sweeter spot between the two sessions, qualifying and the race, so something in the middle. We&#8217;re working hard on it and trying to find out what we can do over the next races to make it better.&#8221;</p><p class=\"w-100\"></p><p class=\"text | article-text\"><b>In simple terms, what is the short and long-term prognosis for tackling the current issues with the VF-23 and will this impact work being undertaken on the VF-24?</b></p><p class=\"text | article-text\">&#8220;We&#8217;re working very hard to try and find out why the discrepancy of being very fast and not so good in the race is happening. We&#8217;ve got a few leads and for sure it will impact the VF-24 design. We obviously have to take that feature out of the car next year.&#8221;</p><p class=\"text | article-text\"><b>Detailed feedback from both Kevin Magnussen and Nico Hulkenberg is obviously crucial to the development of the VF-23. Can you share what they both bring to the engineering table and what you&#8217;ve observed from them both this year as the season has progressed?</b></p><p class=\"text | article-text\">&#8220;I must admit, I&#8217;m actually very happy with both Kevin and Nico about how they&#8217;re an integral part in trying to sort the problem and find the solution, how we tackle the short and long-term fix for this, and they&#8217;re both very positive. Not about the performance in the race right now but positive that we can get out of the problem we have now.&#8221;</p><p class=\"w-100\"></p><p class=\"text | article-text\"><b>Looking ahead to the Austrian Grand Prix &#8211; the Red Bull Ring has often been a happy hunting ground for the team &#8211; with Sprint points and a double-points finish in last year&#8217;s grand prix. Mindful of the team&#8217;s current situation, how are you approaching this next race and will the short nature of the circuit allow the VF-23 to demonstrate some of its strengths?</b></p><p class=\"text | article-text\">&#8220;We&#8217;re going into this race partly a little bit like a test session as well. We have a lot of things to try and cure our problems with the race pace, so we have a few ideas. As we have two races now this weekend, we&#8217;ve got double the amount of time to try to do different things. Obviously, we always try to get the best result possible but also maybe we compromise the best result possible for really understanding what is happening with our car on race day.&#8221;</p><p class=\"text | article-text\">Kevin Magnussen:</p><p class=\"text | article-text\"><b>Round 10 of the 2023 FIA Formula 1 World Championship, the Austrian Grand Prix, will be the second Sprint of the season. The opening Sprint event in Baku in April proved to be a scoreless affair compared to last season where the team scored at every Sprint round. What lessons were learned and is a Sprint still an exciting challenge to have in a busy calendar?</b></p><p class=\"w-100\"></p><p class=\"text | article-text\">&#8220;I&#8217;m looking forward to another Sprint. I like Sprint events, there&#8217;s more stuff happening throughout the weekend and the pressure is on straight away after the first practice. You&#8217;re really performing and battling for important stuff. Even FP1 has way more pressure because it&#8217;s the only practice you get so you have to find your rhythm and hit your marks early on and quickly to maximize your rhythm for qualifying. It&#8217;s just a more focused and more fast-paced weekend, and I quite enjoy that.&#8221;</p><p class=\"text | article-text\"><b>Your best result around the Red Bull Ring came in 2018 with a fifth-place finish, what do you like about the circuit and does its picturesque backdrop play a part in its charm for drivers just as it does for staff and fans visiting Spielberg?</b></p><p class=\"text | article-text\">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why we&#8217;ve been strong here over the years I&#8217;ve been with Haas, but it&#8217;s a fun circuit. Sometimes there are these circuits you tend to go well at and hopefully we can keep that trend going.&#8221;</p><p class=\"text | article-text\"><b>We now move into a stretch of double-headers until the enforced summer shutdown. Does the steady flow of races and the location we&#8217;re going to excite you?</b></p><p class=\"w-100\"></p><p class=\"text | article-text\">&#8220;I always enjoy the European season, the tracks are ones that all drivers know very well and it&#8217;s all just familiar surroundings. There&#8217;s a special atmosphere around the European races so I&#8217;m going to enjoy it and try and make the most of it.&#8221;</p><p class=\"text | article-text\">Nico Hulkenberg:</p><p class=\"text | article-text\"><b>Round 10 of the 2023 FIA Formula 1 World Championship, the Austrian Grand Prix, will be the second Sprint of the season. What lessons did you learn from Baku&#8217;s opening Sprint round, and how differently will you approach this weekend having that experience in the bank?</b></p><p class=\"text | article-text\">&#8220;I&#8217;ve done it once in Baku now, it&#8217;s much more intense because from the first practice session, it&#8217;s much more meaningful, so it definitely felt more intense. It&#8217;s a very different circuit to Baku, it&#8217;s a permanent race track and it has a short lap so there&#8217;s quite a big difference. The approach is the same as always though, we&#8217;ll be professional and try to get something out of it.&#8221;</p><p class=\"w-100\"></p><p class=\"text | article-text\"><b>Your best result around the Red Bull Ring came in 2015 with a sixth-place finish. What do you like about the circuit and does its picturesque backdrop play a part in its charm for drivers just as it does for staff and fans visiting Spielberg?</b></p><p class=\"text | article-text\">&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of nature and the circuit itself is built into the mountains. There&#8217;s great scenery, it&#8217;s a scenic route into the track, and it&#8217;s very green. It&#8217;s one of the shortest, if not the shortest track we go to with just over one minute per lap, but it&#8217;s a technical and challenging track so it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s an easy circuit.&#8221;</p><p class=\"text | article-text\"><b>The Red Bull Ring only has 10 turns, the fewest on the Formula 1 calendar, and is a track that crams in a lot for a driver to manage during one lap. With the midfield fight continuing to be the closest battle up and down the grid, where do you expect the VF-23 to stack up compared to its rivals?</b></p><p class=\"text | article-text\">&#8220;It&#8217;s shorter lap times so the field historically is very condensed there. We&#8217;ve seen it super condensed so I can only imagine the smallest of margins will make a big difference, so it&#8217;s important we maximize the sessions and get everything out of it.&#8221;</p><p class=\"copyright |\"><i>Copyright 2023 WBTV.

Once more the two-race format will feature this weekend, with separate qualifying sessions for the Sprint Race and the grand prix, as was first introduced in Baku in April. It will mark the second of six F1 Sprint events through the 2023 season.\n\nThe Red Bull Ring brings back uplifting memories for MoneyGram Haas F1 Team. Its highest double finish of fourth and fifth came at the 2018 running of the event while last year both cars were classified inside the top eight in the grand prix. Fifth, in 2018, represents Kevin Magnussen\u2019s best Austria finish while Nico Hulkenberg took a high of sixth in 2015, prior to capturing a front-row grid spot for 2016\u2032s race.\n\nGuenther Steiner - Team Principal:\n\nThe Canadian Grand Prix saw highs and lows for the team in both qualifying and the race. Having had a few days away to further analyze the weekend \u2013 what can you share about the VF-23\u2032s characteristics where it\u2019s capable of such good one-lap pace in Saturday qualifying, evidenced by multiple Q3 appearances, but then struggles to keep tires alive in race conditions on a Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re investigating the very good performance we have in qualifying and not-so-good performance during the race at the moment. We\u2019re trying to pinpoint it but for the next races we\u2019re maybe going to try and find a sweeter spot between the two sessions, qualifying and the race, so something in the middle. We\u2019re working hard on it and trying to find out what we can do over the next races to make it better.\u201d\n\nIn simple terms, what is the short and long-term prognosis for tackling the current issues with the VF-23 and will this impact work being undertaken on the VF-24?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working very hard to try and find out why the discrepancy of being very fast and not so good in the race is happening. We\u2019ve got a few leads and for sure it will impact the VF-24 design. We obviously have to take that feature out of the car next year.\u201d\n\nDetailed feedback from both Kevin Magnussen and Nico Hulkenberg is obviously crucial to the development of the VF-23. Can you share what they both bring to the engineering table and what you\u2019ve observed from them both this year as the season has progressed?\n\n\u201cI must admit, I\u2019m actually very happy with both Kevin and Nico about how they\u2019re an integral part in trying to sort the problem and find the solution, how we tackle the short and long-term fix for this, and they\u2019re both very positive. Not about the performance in the race right now but positive that we can get out of the problem we have now.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead to the Austrian Grand Prix \u2013 the Red Bull Ring has often been a happy hunting ground for the team \u2013 with Sprint points and a double-points finish in last year\u2019s grand prix. Mindful of the team\u2019s current situation, how are you approaching this next race and will the short nature of the circuit allow the VF-23 to demonstrate some of its strengths?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going into this race partly a little bit like a test session as well. We have a lot of things to try and cure our problems with the race pace, so we have a few ideas. As we have two races now this weekend, we\u2019ve got double the amount of time to try to do different things. Obviously, we always try to get the best result possible but also maybe we compromise the best result possible for really understanding what is happening with our car on race day.\u201d\n\nKevin Magnussen:\n\nRound 10 of the 2023 FIA Formula 1 World Championship, the Austrian Grand Prix, will be the second Sprint of the season. The opening Sprint event in Baku in April proved to be a scoreless affair compared to last season where the team scored at every Sprint round. What lessons were learned and is a Sprint still an exciting challenge to have in a busy calendar?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to another Sprint. I like Sprint events, there\u2019s more stuff happening throughout the weekend and the pressure is on straight away after the first practice. You\u2019re really performing and battling for important stuff. Even FP1 has way more pressure because it\u2019s the only practice you get so you have to find your rhythm and hit your marks early on and quickly to maximize your rhythm for qualifying. It\u2019s just a more focused and more fast-paced weekend, and I quite enjoy that.\u201d\n\nYour best result around the Red Bull Ring came in 2018 with a fifth-place finish, what do you like about the circuit and does its picturesque backdrop play a part in its charm for drivers just as it does for staff and fans visiting Spielberg?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why we\u2019ve been strong here over the years I\u2019ve been with Haas, but it\u2019s a fun circuit. Sometimes there are these circuits you tend to go well at and hopefully we can keep that trend going.\u201d\n\nWe now move into a stretch of double-headers until the enforced summer shutdown. Does the steady flow of races and the location we\u2019re going to excite you?\n\n\u201cI always enjoy the European season, the tracks are ones that all drivers know very well and it\u2019s all just familiar surroundings. There\u2019s a special atmosphere around the European races so I\u2019m going to enjoy it and try and make the most of it.\u201d\n\nNico Hulkenberg:\n\nRound 10 of the 2023 FIA Formula 1 World Championship, the Austrian Grand Prix, will be the second Sprint of the season. What lessons did you learn from Baku\u2019s opening Sprint round, and how differently will you approach this weekend having that experience in the bank?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done it once in Baku now, it\u2019s much more intense because from the first practice session, it\u2019s much more meaningful, so it definitely felt more intense. It\u2019s a very different circuit to Baku, it\u2019s a permanent race track and it has a short lap so there\u2019s quite a big difference. The approach is the same as always though, we\u2019ll be professional and try to get something out of it.\u201d\n\nYour best result around the Red Bull Ring came in 2015 with a sixth-place finish. What do you like about the circuit and does its picturesque backdrop play a part in its charm for drivers just as it does for staff and fans visiting Spielberg?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nature and the circuit itself is built into the mountains. There\u2019s great scenery, it\u2019s a scenic route into the track, and it\u2019s very green. It\u2019s one of the shortest, if not the shortest track we go to with just over one minute per lap, but it\u2019s a technical and challenging track so it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s an easy circuit.\u201d\n\nThe Red Bull Ring only has 10 turns, the fewest on the Formula 1 calendar, and is a track that crams in a lot for a driver to manage during one lap. With the midfield fight continuing to be the closest battle up and down the grid, where do you expect the VF-23 to stack up compared to its rivals?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s shorter lap times so the field historically is very condensed there. We\u2019ve seen it super condensed so I can only imagine the smallest of margins will make a big difference, so it\u2019s important we maximize the sessions and get everything out of it.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2023 WBTV.

to sixth after the Red Bull driver&#8217;s latest qualifying woes, making a series of late moves to finish ahead of Aston Martin&#8217;s Fernando Alonso, Williams&#8217; Alex Albon and the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz.</p>\n<p>Williams almost had two cars in the points on home soil, with Logan Sargeant a personal best 11th, followed by the Alfa Romeo of Valtteri Bottas, who started at the back after being excluded from qualifying, and Nico Hulkenberg, who dropped to the rear early on when he picked up front wing damage on his Haas.</p>\n<p>Lance Stroll wound up 14th after being penalised for causing a collision with Pierre Gasly, who was forced to retire thereafter, joining team mate Esteban Ocon, who pitted early on amid apparent technical trouble &#8211; and Magnussen on the sidelines.</p>\n<p>Zhou Guanyu was 15th in the other Alfa Romeo, having made three pit stops (one more than anyone else), with AlphaTauri pair Yuki Tsunoda and Nyck de Vries the final drivers to cross the line after Gasly&#8217;s aforementioned dramas.</p>\n<p>After the chequered flag, there was no hiding Verstappen&#8217;s excitement as he not only moved 99 points clear of Perez in the drivers&#8217; standings, but also gave Red Bull a record-equalling 11th successive F1 win.</p>\n\n    <h3>AS IT HAPPENED</h3>\n<p>A change to the starting grid post-qualifying saw Bottas dropped from 15th to 20th and last, having been excluded from the session after his Alfa Romeo stopped out on track in Q1 and the team failed to provide a sufficient fuel sample thereafter.</p>\n<p>As the drivers returned to Silverstone for race day, the rain seen in that grid-deciding session had cleared and been replaced by brighter skies, but the threat of further showers could not be counted out, while strong winds added to the challenge once again.</p>\n<p>A couple of minutes before the race start, the tyre blankets came off to reveal that most drivers had chosen medium tyres for their first stints, while Russell, Ocon, Tsunoda and De Vries chose softs and Hulkenberg and Bottas opted for hards.</p>\n<p>When the lights went out, Norris sent the home crowd wild as he bolted off the line and charged his way past Verstappen for the lead into Turn 1, with the Dutchman having to go defensive to keep the other McLaren of Piastri behind over the next few corners.</p>\n<p>Behind the top three runners, Leclerc held fourth from the fellow fast-starting Russell, who made the most of his soft tyres, with Sainz, Alonso, Gasly, Hamilton (having run wide and lost a place at Village) and Albon holding the final top 10 positions.</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"NORTHAMPTON, ENGLAND - JULY 09:

perilously close to contact, while the other Mercedes of Hamilton set about overhauling Alonso for P8, repeating Verstappen&#8217;s move on Norris on Lap 7.</p>\n<p>With Norris and Piastri back in the

Norris jumped Verstappen for the lead at the start, with team mate Oscar Piastri almost following him through, meaning it was a Red Bull in a McLaren sandwich over the first few laps \u2013 but the reigning double world champion soon fought back. AS IT HAPPENED: Follow all the action from the 2023 British Grand Prix By Lap 5, and with DRS at his disposal, Verstappen reclaimed P1 from Norris and never looked troubled, pulling away from the home favourite as the race developed and then managing a late Safety Car period \u2013 caused by Kevin Magnussen\u2019s smoking Haas \u2013 that saw the leaders go for different tyre strategies. While the majority of the front-runners chose soft tyres under the Safety Car, Norris went for hards, meaning he had to pull off some impressive defending to remain P2 over fellow Briton Lewis Hamilton, who jumped Piastri when the race was neutralised. Piastri had held third for the majority of the 52-lap encounter, only to pit just before the aforementioned Safety Car, but fourth \u2013 a couple of seconds up on the other Mercedes of George Russell \u2013 still represented the best result of the Australian rookie\u2019s burgeoning F1 career.\n\nFORMULA 1 ARAMCO BRITISH GRAND PRIX 2023 Great Britain 2023 Race results POSITION TIME POINTS 1 Max Verstappen VER Red Bull Racing 1:25:16.938 26 2 Lando Norris NOR McLaren +3.798s 18 3 Lewis Hamilton HAM Mercedes +6.783s 15 4 Oscar Piastri PIA McLaren +7.776s 12 5 George Russell RUS Mercedes +11.206s 10\n\nSergio Perez delivered another solid recovery drive to sixth after the Red Bull driver\u2019s latest qualifying woes, making a series of late moves to finish ahead of Aston Martin\u2019s Fernando Alonso, Williams\u2019 Alex Albon and the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz.

As the order filtered through after those stops, Verstappen (softs) held P1 from Norris (hards), with Hamilton (softs) jumping Piastri (hards) for third, Russell (mediums) holding fifth and lamenting a missed opportunity over the radio, Alonso (softs) in sixth and Sainz (hards), Perez (softs), Albon (softs) and Leclerc (mediums) rounding out the top 10. \u201cWonderful, huh?\u201d Norris sarcastically commented when his engineer informed him of the tyres the cars around him were running, given that only 15 laps remained \u2013 the Safety Car still circulating \u2013 and both McLarens were on the hardest tyres. At the end of Lap 38, the Safety Car peeled into the pits and released the pack of cars into green flag conditions once more \u2013 Verstappen mastering the restart on softer rubber to hold the lead from Norris and Hamilton, who looked lively and ready to attack his fellow Brit. What followed was a thrilling, multi-lap exchange between the youngster and the seven-time world champion, Norris making his McLaren as wide as possible on several occasions as his tyres came up to temperature to keep the Mercedes behind.\n\nThe late Safety Car led to some mixed tyre strategies for the final stint\n\n\u201cThat McLaren is so quick on those hards \u2013 impressive,\u201d Russell commented from P5, behind the other chrome-liveried MCL60 of Piastri, with Alonso, Sainz, Perez, Albon and Leclerc still holding onto the final points-paying positions. Meanwhile, Gasly jumped on the radio to demand that Stroll return P11 to him after a move around the outside of Stowe. Up front, Verstappen commented that his soft tyres were \u201cnot feeling that good\u201d, but his times were still several tenths quicker than Norris, while team mate Perez sparked a demise for Sainz with a move at Club \u2013 Albon and Leclerc swiftly following him through. With the stewards taking no action over Stroll\u2019s initial, bold pass on Gasly, the pair would clash again after battling Sainz for the final point, making contact into Club and leaving the Alpine with apparent suspension damage, forcing him into retirement. This time, Stroll was given a five-second penalty for his actions. Perez\u2019s charge continued with a pass on Alonso into Stowe for P6, while Albon, Leclerc and Sainz brought back memories of previous eras as Williams \u2013 celebrating their 800th Grand Prix \u2013 went toe-to-toe with Ferrari on merit.\n\nVerstappen controlled the Safety Car restart before pulling clear again\n\nAs the final laps ticked down, Verstappen continued to stretch out his lead over Norris, eventually crossing the line just under four seconds clear to bag his eighth win of the season, with Hamilton finishing three seconds further back to make it two Brits on the podium. Piastri took a fine fourth in the other McLaren, despite the opportunity of a podium going begging, followed by Russell, Perez and Alonso, with Albon, Leclerc and Sainz scoring the final points of the day after their squabble. Sargeant almost made it a double points finish for Williams in 11th, followed by Bottas and Hulkenberg, who recovered from their respective qualifying and early-race troubles, with the penalised Stroll ending up 14th. Zhou was 15th after a third stop to swap to softs under the Safety Car, with Tsunoda and De Vries the last drivers to cross the line in 16th and 17th respectively \u2013 Gasly six laps down after his incident with Stroll and Magnussen and Ocon the two DNFs.\n\nNorris and Hamilton celebrate on the podium",

            "article_html": "<div><h3>Mercedes</h3>\n<p>Mercedes didn&#8217;t even make it out on track during FP1 before the red flags came, but managed plenty of laps in the elongated FP2 session. Opting to go for their hot laps a little later than the rest, they were able to take advantage of a more rubbered-in track. That combined with some solid driving from both team mates saw Hamilton top the session at a track he normally goes well at, with Russell barely a hair&#8217;s breadth behind.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.hamilton-and-russell-say-mercedes-have-work-to-do-despite-topping-the.1UKxTY1UZdXwtVNwt5gnAy.html\">READ MORE: Hamilton and Russell say Mercedes have 'work to do' despite topping the timesheets during FP2 in Montreal</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Lewis Hamilton &#8211; FP1: No time set; FP2: 1:13.718, P1</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a strange day with the issues in FP1. I felt really bad for all the fans out there; we&#8217;ve had a great crowd out here since yesterday and the city&#8217;s been pumping. I&#8217;m glad that we got out there eventually though and it was good to have a 90-minute session. We haven&#8217;t had one of them in a long time! I love driving this track, it&#8217;s mega! From the moment you leave the pitlane you just think &#8216;yeah, this is wicked!&#8217; It is probably the bumpiest circuit that we&#8217;ve been on for a long time, however. I think everyone is struggling with the bumps though. Overall, the car didn&#8217;t feel bad, but we&#8217;ve definitely got some work to do. We&#8217;ve just got to improve our ride control and balance through corner, and I think we will be alright. The car overall is a step forward from earlier in the season and I do think I&#8217;m feeling the improvements that we saw in Monaco and Barcelona. I love the rain so let&#8217;s try and have some fun tomorrow!&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>George Russell - FP1: No time set; FP2: 1:13.745, P2</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been quite a strange day given what happened in FP1 and then the extension of FP2. It was a reasonably productive session, but I don&#8217;t think we can read too much into the timings. We did our low fuel qualifying preparation towards the end of the session when the track was quicker. Barcelona and here are two totally different circuits, so it&#8217;s hard to compare how the car is performing from one to another. Barcelona is a super smooth, high-speed track whilst here it is incredibly bumpy. I do think the upgrades we&#8217;ve brought have helped the limitations of the car though. Pace-wise, I think we&#8217;re going to be on the tail end of Ferrari and Aston Martin in qualifying. We know it comes to us on a Sunday though and that&#8217;s when it matters. It also looks like it&#8217;s going to be wet tomorrow so let&#8217;s see what that brings.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;After the non-running in FP1, we decided to start our FP2 programme with high fuel work before moving on to low fuel running. That was to ensure we completed our long runs before the expected rain fell. We were an outlier in that respect and our low fuel work therefore benefited from more track evolution than the rest of the field. That was the predominant reason as to why we finished at the top of the time sheets. Overall, the car and tyres seemed to be in a decent window during the session. There are areas of improvement we will focus on overnight, including trying to find more rear end for both the single lap and long runs. We are also looking to see if we can improve the ride around this notoriously bumpy track, as that will help us carry more speed through the chicanes. There&#8217;s also a good chance of rain tomorrow; that could change the picture significantly but hopefully we&#8217;ll get the chance to do some wet running in FP3.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MONTREAL, QUEBEC - JUNE 16: George Russell of Great Britain driving the (63) Mercedes AMG Petronas\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MONTREAL, QUEBEC - JUNE 16: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MONTREAL, QUEBEC - JUNE 16: George Russell of Great Britain driving the (63) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W14 on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Canada at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on June 16, 2023 in Montreal, Quebec.

They worked through their own programme and were seemingly unconcerned with what others were up to. Both drivers set their quick runs in FP2 relatively early before the track had fully evolved, before concentrating on longer run pace. The only hiccup was Perez having a messy lap where he nearly clobbered the wall and had to ran across a chicane, but luckily he brought the car home in one piece.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.verstappen-expects-a-few-surprises-during-qualifying-in-canada-as-he.kEnvRLbPFf3NslHC4PRTq.html\">READ MORE: Verstappen expects &#8216;a few surprises&#8217; during qualifying in Canada as he reflects on &#8216;tricky&#8217; first day for Red Bull</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Max Verstappen - FP1: 1:20.231, P5; FP2: 1:14.142, P6</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t a straightforward day with basically no running in FP1, it was the same for everyone though. At least we could get in a decent amount of running in FP2. I think we still have quite a bit of work to do as the car isn&#8217;t fantastic at the moment over the bumps and kerbs. I mean it&#8217;s still not too bad, but we definitely need to fine tune a few things. I think it might be raining tomorrow which will throw a few surprises out there in qualifying, then perhaps dry on Sunday so that will also affect things. It was a tricky session but sometimes we have those days.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Sergio Perez - FP1: 1:20.154, P4; FP2: 1:14.250, P8</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was a real shame that we ended up losing FP1, we really needed it because the conditions weren&#8217;t ideal in FP2 towards the end. I think we&#8217;ve got good pace and just need to make sure we play a bit with the car now to get it in the right window because today has all been a bit of a hurry. There is plenty for us to understand tonight, we need to improve our ride and the other teams look strong too, so we will see tomorrow where everybody is. I think it should be an interesting weekend, it gets really dark here in this weather, the visibility becomes poor and the conditions become undriveable pretty quickly - if the rain comes for qualifying hopefully it&#8217;s not much.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MONTREAL, QUEBEC - JUNE 16: Max Verstappen of the Netherlands driving the (1) Oracle Red Bull\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"perez-canada-practice-garage-2023.png\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MONTREAL, QUEBEC - JUNE 16: Max Verstappen of the Netherlands driving the (1) Oracle Red Bull Racing RB19 on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Canada at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on June 16, 2023 in Montreal, Quebec.

They both headed out in the heavy rain late on too, but after Stroll ran wide the team wisely called them back to the pits.</p>\n<p><strong>Fernando Alonso &#8211; FP1: 1:19.807, P3; FP2: 1:14.044, P4</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good to see all of the support here and be back racing in front of the Canadian fans. But it was a shame that we weren't able to run in FP1 due to the technical issues. We didn&#8217;t have a lot of time to fully understand the new upgrades on the car, so we will have to analyse everything overnight and learn more tomorrow. We will keep an eye on the weather radar again for tomorrow, as it could be another mixed day.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Lance Stroll - FP1: 1:19.175, P2; FP2: 1:14.419, P9</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s running was fairly disrupted, but it&#8217;s the same situation for all teams and we made the most of the extended FP2 session this afternoon. When you&#8217;re running new upgrades, the practice sessions become about learning how they impact the feel of the car and about ensuring that they&#8217;re operating in the expected way. I was happy with the car and thought it was feeling good, but we&#8217;ll take the time to look through the data tonight and ensure we&#8217;re ready to put in a strong performance in qualifying tomorrow.

That led to the initial red flag, with no more running possible after that due to an issue with the circuit&#8217;s CCTV cameras. He did get out in FP2, but Alpine again caused red flags, this time after Ocon was told to stop the car with a suspected water pressure issue. They will be in need of track time tomorrow as they play catch up to the rest.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.alpine-duo-very-much-on-the-backfoot-after-reliability-hampered-friday-in.2L4Eokza98vI8oJpzZx02E.html\">READ MORE: Alpine duo &#8216;very much on the backfoot&#8217; after reliability-hampered Friday in Montreal</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Esteban Ocon - FP1: No time set; FP2: 1:15.092, P18</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a difficult day today. We started with a disrupted Free Practice 1 with a power outage issue and malfunctioning CCTV systems around the track, which meant all teams had little to no running. Free Practice 2 was also interrupted on our side due to a suspected loss of water pressure in the car. Obviously, it&#8217;s been a far from straightforward day for us, so we&#8217;ll have to get on top of the issues so we can ensure tomorrow, when it counts, is better. We&#8217;ll debrief and analyse the data we managed to get today and keep our heads down to make sure we make the most of Free Practice 3 tomorrow to be ready for qualifying.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Pierre Gasly - FP1: No time set; FP2: 1:14.477, P10</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;That was a very different Friday practice but, in the end, on my side, we managed to have a productive day. It did not start so well with an issue with the spare steering wheel on my first run in Free Practice 1. Fortunately, we did not miss out on any running due to the red flag for the circuit systems. Free Practice 2 was much better and we were able to progress our programme for almost the full one-and-a-half-hour session before the rain at the end. I had an interesting moment at Turn 4 with the rear sliding but managed to keep it away from the wall. I think we&#8217;re in a good place ahead of the rest of the weekend and hopefully tomorrow&#8217;s Practice can be better to set ourselves up for qualifying.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Otmar Szafnauer, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not been a normal day of practice today in Montreal with some interruptions causing disruption to all teams&#8217; programmes. In Free Practice 1, we had a problem on Pierre&#8217;s car due to an electrical fault on the spare steering wheel, which caused him to stop on track. This was replaced to his normal wheel for the second session with no issues and he was able to have a productive afternoon. Unfortunately, Esteban&#8217;s session stopped early in Free Practice 2 as a result of losing water pressure on his car; we will take the time to investigate the cause of this issue. It means our running today was limited and we must target a much smoother Free Practice 3 tomorrow to put ourselves in the best possible position ahead of qualifying. The weather looks mixed with a high chance of rain throughout the day, so we&#8217;ll remain ready for all possibilities.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MONTREAL, QUEBEC - JUNE 16: Esteban Ocon of France and Alpine F1 looks on in the garage during\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MONTREAL, QUEBEC - JUNE 16: The car of Pierre Gasly of France and Alpine F1 is recovered to the\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MONTREAL, QUEBEC - JUNE 16: Esteban Ocon of France and Alpine F1 looks on in the garage during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Canada at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on June 16, 2023 in Montreal, Quebec.

But he showed he does have decent pace here with a top 10 slot in FP2 for good measure, before remarking that the weather was more suitable for ducks than F1 cars after sliding off onto the grass in the heavy rain. Zhou also had a good day, keeping his head down and getting plenty of laps under his belt.</p>\n<p><strong>Valtteri Bottas - FP1: 1:18.728, P1; FP2: 1:14.220, P7</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a bit of an unusual Friday for everyone; we only managed to set one timed lap in FP1, before the session got red flagged and subsequently stopped. On the other hand, we got to do an extended FP2, getting a decent number of laps in, with only the final minutes of the session being slightly compromised by the rain. Overall, it&#8217;s been a positive day: the car felt good in dry conditions, and our performance was within the top ten the whole time, which is encouraging for the rest of the weekend ahead. The weather forecast remains mixed, so our focus will be on finding a good compromise to be at our best both in dry and wet conditions. Based on today, our car has the potential to make it into Q3, so that will be what we&#8217;ll be working towards.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Zhou Guanyu - FP1: 1:24.961, P9; FP2: 1:14.811, P14</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Overall, it&#8217;s been a solid day: we managed to go through our whole programme for the day during FP2, which offset having spent most of FP1 under a red flag. It looks like tomorrow&#8217;s weather will be very similar to what we had today towards the end of the second practice session, with heavy rain, which can be tricky; we&#8217;ll work on it tonight, to make sure we can make a proper step forward tomorrow. It will be important to find a good compromise between set-ups, as Sunday may as well be mostly cloudy instead. Our main aim is to get into Q3; the minimum would be achieving a decent position in Q2, similar to what we had in Barcelona, to allow us to drive into the points in the race. I am confident we can achieve this; the wet conditions always add a variable to the equation, but we will make sure to come prepared.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MONTREAL, QUEBEC - JUNE 16: Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MONTREAL, QUEBEC - JUNE 16: Zhou Guanyu of China driving the (24) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MONTREAL, QUEBEC - JUNE 16: Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Canada at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on June 16, 2023 in Montreal, Quebec.

He was on the soft compound tyre too, and did well to slither back to the pits. Norris loves the wet stuff and he wasted no time heading out on the inters for a play, twice going out to explore the conditions in preparation for what could be a wet qualifying tomorrow.</p>\n<p><strong>Lando Norris - FP1: No time set; FP2: 1:14.617, P13</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nice to be back here in Canada, at a track I enjoy. We had an OK day, it was actually good to get out in mixed conditions. We&#8217;ve been working hard trying to find a good set-up. A good balance with the car to feel comfortable is the most important thing, and we were making steps forward. We&#8217;ll continue to do that into tomorrow and work hard for a good result in quali.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Oscar Piastri - FP1: 1:21.496, P6; FP2: 1:14.533, P11</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We had a decent session this afternoon and seemed to be pretty solid out of the box, the pace seemed to be reasonable. It&#8217;s a fun track, very bumpy, but I enjoyed getting some time out on-track. The weather came in pretty suddenly at the end, which gave us a taste of wet weather running. We&#8217;ll see what the rest of the weekend throws at us but I&#8217;d say a reasonably encouraging start.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Andrea Stella, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;An unconventional Friday at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. After FP1 was effectively cancelled due to technical issues, we had the compensation of an extended FP2 and extra sets of tyres, which allowed us to run through a large part of our programme. We couldn&#8217;t do everything that we wanted but despite that, I think we&#8217;ve gained a good understanding of performance potential, set-up direction and the behaviour of the tyres. The rain at the end also allowed us to check the Intermediate tyres, so taken all together we&#8217;ve gathered quite a lot of information from practice today. We&#8217;ll study it overnight and try to be ready for whatever we face in qualifying and the race.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MONTREAL, QUEBEC - JUNE 16: Lando Norris of Great Britain driving the (4) McLaren MCL60 Mercedes on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MONTREAL, QUEBEC - JUNE 16: Oscar Piastri of Australia driving the (81) McLaren MCL60 Mercedes on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MONTREAL, QUEBEC - JUNE 16: Lando Norris of Great Britain driving the (4) McLaren MCL60 Mercedes on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Canada at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on June 16, 2023 in Montreal, Quebec.

Tsunoda ran wide at Turn 1 and had to bounce across the grass during the second session, and wasn&#8217;t able to set a fully clean lap on the softs. As such, AlphaTauri&#8217;s place in the pecking order is a slight mystery.</p>\n<p><strong>Nyck de Vries - FP1: 1:32.274, P12; FP2: 1:15.002, P16</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it was a challenging day for everyone. Obviously, FP1 was interrupted so we had to change our run plan for the afternoon but nonetheless, I think we completed enough laps to be able to get up to speed with the track. Tomorrow will see different conditions again with rain forecasted, so there is lots of work ahead of us. As the track is quite different compared to Barcelona, more bumpy, narrow, and with less grip, I will have to get used to it and make the necessary changes. We didn&#8217;t do any laps in the rain today, but the grip seems low in dry conditions already, so we will have to see how it goes in the wet.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Yuki Tsunoda - FP1: No time set; FP2: 1:14.941, P15</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Although FP1 was interrupted, we still had two hours of running on track, which was enough. Our balance isn&#8217;t too bad, but it seems we are struggling to find pace during our performance runs. It looks like it will be raining tomorrow so we will be focusing on wet conditions for one-lap runs, with multiple tyre sets left to use. We did some long runs in the dry, and the pace doesn&#8217;t seem bad, but first, let&#8217;s see how tomorrow goes. I hope we can achieve Q2 or Q3 tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Jonathan Eddolls, Chief Race Engineer</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a very different Friday to usual here in Canada. In FP1 we managed to get our planned aero rake running completed before the red flag, and then it was a case of waiting in the garage while the circuit resolved the CCTV issues. These were not fixed in time, but the plan to extend FP2 and start the session 30 minutes earlier was a very good decision, because we knew the chances of rain later in the afternoon were high. We were able to carry FP1 tyres into FP2, which was now 90 minutes long, so we had three brand new sets and one nearly new set of tyres to use. The plan focused on giving the drivers as many laps as possible, with short runs and pitstops on the four sets of tyres, before turning our attention to the long runs. We were tracking the rain and could see it coming towards the end of the session, so the run plans were geared around this and we managed to cover all the planned work. The track was declared wet, so to get our \"free\" intermediate tyres for tomorrow, we had to complete one lap on it. This was done in the dry because we didn&#8217;t want to risk a red flag and miss the opportunity. Overall, we were expecting a bit more pace than we showed, but given the dense programme, we didn&#8217;t focus on setup changes. I think we can make a step forward tomorrow with changes to the car overnight.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MONTREAL, QUEBEC - JUNE 16: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan and Scuderia AlphaTauri prepares to drive in the\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MONTREAL, QUEBEC - JUNE 16: Nyck de Vries of Netherlands driving the (21) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MONTREAL, QUEBEC - JUNE 16: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan and Scuderia AlphaTauri prepares to drive in the garage during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Canada at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on June 16, 2023 in Montreal, Quebec.

After an initial analysis of the data acquired, we can confirm our predictions prior to the event, regarding the behaviour of the two softer compounds, with the C5 proving ideal in terms of performance over a single lap and the C4 looking a better option for the race. Although today, on a track that was still very dirty, we did see signs of a bit of graining, especially on the rear tyres. In terms of degradation there were no particular surprises. As for the rest of the weekend, uncertainty over the weather is an important element to consider, with rain expected tomorrow, while Sunday should see a dry race. If this was the case, even the track conditions could produce some surprises.\"</p>\n\n    </div>",
            "text": "Mercedes Mercedes didn\u2019t even make it out on track during FP1 before the red flags came, but managed plenty of laps in the elongated FP2 session. Opting to go for their hot laps a little later than the rest, they were able to take advantage of a more rubbered-in track. That combined with some solid driving from both team mates saw Hamilton top the session at a track he normally goes well at, with Russell barely a hair\u2019s breadth behind. READ MORE: Hamilton and Russell say Mercedes have 'work to do' despite topping the timesheets during FP2 in Montreal Lewis Hamilton \u2013 FP1: No time set; FP2: 1:13.718, P1 \u201cIt was a strange day with the issues in FP1. I felt really bad for all the fans out there; we\u2019ve had a great crowd out here since yesterday and the city\u2019s been pumping. I\u2019m glad that we got out there eventually though and it was good to have a 90-minute session. We haven\u2019t had one of them in a long time! I love driving this track, it\u2019s mega! From the moment you leave the pitlane you just think \u2018yeah, this is wicked!\u2019 It is probably the bumpiest circuit that we\u2019ve been on for a long time, however. I think everyone is struggling with the bumps though. Overall, the car didn\u2019t feel bad, but we\u2019ve definitely got some work to do. We\u2019ve just got to improve our ride control and balance through corner, and I think we will be alright. The car overall is a step forward from earlier in the season and I do think I\u2019m feeling the improvements that we saw in Monaco and Barcelona. I love the rain so let\u2019s try and have some fun tomorrow!\u201d George Russell - FP1: No time set; FP2: 1:13.745, P2 \u201cIt\u2019s been quite a strange day given what happened in FP1 and then the extension of FP2. It was a reasonably productive session, but I don\u2019t think we can read too much into the timings. We did our low fuel qualifying preparation towards the end of the session when the track was quicker. Barcelona and here are two totally different circuits, so it\u2019s hard to compare how the car is performing from one to another. Barcelona is a super smooth, high-speed track whilst here it is incredibly bumpy. I do think the upgrades we\u2019ve brought have helped the limitations of the car though. Pace-wise, I think we\u2019re going to be on the tail end of Ferrari and Aston Martin in qualifying. We know it comes to us on a Sunday though and that\u2019s when it matters. It also looks like it\u2019s going to be wet tomorrow so let\u2019s see what that brings.\u201d Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director \u201cAfter the non-running in FP1, we decided to start our FP2 programme with high fuel work before moving on to low fuel running. That was to ensure we completed our long runs before the expected rain fell. We were an outlier in that respect and our low fuel work therefore benefited from more track evolution than the rest of the field. That was the predominant reason as to why we finished at the top of the time sheets. Overall, the car and tyres seemed to be in a decent window during the session. There are areas of improvement we will focus on overnight, including trying to find more rear end for both the single lap and long runs. We are also looking to see if we can improve the ride around this notoriously bumpy track, as that will help us carry more speed through the chicanes. There\u2019s also a good chance of rain tomorrow; that could change the picture significantly but hopefully we\u2019ll get the chance to do some wet running in FP3.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 MONTREAL, QUEBEC - JUNE 16: George Russell of Great Britain driving the (63) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W14 on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Canada at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on June 16, 2023 in Montreal, Quebec.

Both drivers set their quick runs in FP2 relatively early before the track had fully evolved, before concentrating on longer run pace.

At least we could get in a decent amount of running in FP2. I think we still have quite a bit of work to do as the car isn\u2019t fantastic at the moment over the bumps and kerbs. I mean it\u2019s still not too bad, but we definitely need to fine tune a few things. I think it might be raining tomorrow which will throw a few surprises out there in qualifying, then perhaps dry on Sunday so that will also affect things. It was a tricky session but sometimes we have those days.\u201d Sergio Perez - FP1: 1:20.154, P4; FP2: 1:14.250, P8 \"It was a real shame that we ended up losing FP1, we really needed it because the conditions weren\u2019t ideal in FP2 towards the end. I think we\u2019ve got good pace and just need to make sure we play a bit with the car now to get it in the right window because today has all been a bit of a hurry. There is plenty for us to understand tonight, we need to improve our ride and the other teams look strong too, so we will see tomorrow where everybody is. I think it should be an interesting weekend, it gets really dark here in this weather, the visibility becomes poor and the conditions become undriveable pretty quickly - if the rain comes for qualifying hopefully it\u2019s not much.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 MONTREAL, QUEBEC - JUNE 16: Max Verstappen of the Netherlands driving the (1) Oracle Red Bull Racing RB19 on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Canada at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on June 16, 2023 in Montreal, Quebec.

But it was a shame that we weren't able to run in FP1 due to the technical issues. We didn\u2019t have a lot of time to fully understand the new upgrades on the car, so we will have to analyse everything overnight and learn more tomorrow.

When you\u2019re running new upgrades, the practice sessions become about learning how they impact the feel of the car and about ensuring that they\u2019re operating in the expected way. I was happy with the car and thought it was feeling good, but we\u2019ll take the time to look through the data tonight and ensure we\u2019re ready to put in a strong performance in qualifying tomorrow.

We started with a disrupted Free Practice 1 with a power outage issue and malfunctioning CCTV systems around the track, which meant all teams had little to no running. Free Practice 2 was also interrupted on our side due to a suspected loss of water pressure in the car. Obviously, it\u2019s been a far from straightforward day for us, so we\u2019ll have to get on top of the issues so we can ensure tomorrow, when it counts, is better. We\u2019ll debrief and analyse the data we managed to get today and keep our heads down to make sure we make the most of Free Practice 3 tomorrow to be ready for qualifying.\u201d Pierre Gasly - FP1: No time set; FP2: 1:14.477, P10 \u201cThat was a very different Friday practice but, in the end, on my side, we managed to have a productive day. It did not start so well with an issue with the spare steering wheel on my first run in Free Practice 1. Fortunately, we did not miss out on any running due to the red flag for the circuit systems. Free Practice 2 was much better and we were able to progress our programme for almost the full one-and-a-half-hour session before the rain at the end. I had an interesting moment at Turn 4 with the rear sliding but managed to keep it away from the wall. I think we\u2019re in a good place ahead of the rest of the weekend and hopefully tomorrow\u2019s Practice can be better to set ourselves up for qualifying.\u201d Otmar Szafnauer, Team Principal \u201cIt\u2019s not been a normal day of practice today in Montreal with some interruptions causing disruption to all teams\u2019 programmes. In Free Practice 1, we had a problem on Pierre\u2019s car due to an electrical fault on the spare steering wheel, which caused him to stop on track. This was replaced to his normal wheel for the second session with no issues and he was able to have a productive afternoon. Unfortunately, Esteban\u2019s session stopped early in Free Practice 2 as a result of losing water pressure on his car; we will take the time to investigate the cause of this issue. It means our running today was limited and we must target a much smoother Free Practice 3 tomorrow to put ourselves in the best possible position ahead of qualifying.

But he showed he does have decent pace here with a top 10 slot in FP2 for good measure, before remarking that the weather was more suitable for ducks than F1 cars after sliding off onto the grass in the heavy rain. Zhou also had a good day, keeping his head down and getting plenty of laps under his belt. Valtteri Bottas - FP1: 1:18.728, P1; FP2: 1:14.220, P7 \u201cIt\u2019s been a bit of an unusual Friday for everyone; we only managed to set one timed lap in FP1, before the session got red flagged and subsequently stopped. On the other hand, we got to do an extended FP2, getting a decent number of laps in, with only the final minutes of the session being slightly compromised by the rain. Overall, it\u2019s been a positive day: the car felt good in dry conditions, and our performance was within the top ten the whole time, which is encouraging for the rest of the weekend ahead. The weather forecast remains mixed, so our focus will be on finding a good compromise to be at our best both in dry and wet conditions. Based on today, our car has the potential to make it into Q3, so that will be what we\u2019ll be working towards.\u201d Zhou Guanyu - FP1: 1:24.961, P9; FP2: 1:14.811, P14 \u201cOverall, it\u2019s been a solid day: we managed to go through our whole programme for the day during FP2, which offset having spent most of FP1 under a red flag. It looks like tomorrow\u2019s weather will be very similar to what we had today towards the end of the second practice session, with heavy rain, which can be tricky; we\u2019ll work on it tonight, to make sure we can make a proper step forward tomorrow. It will be important to find a good compromise between set-ups, as Sunday may as well be mostly cloudy instead. Our main aim is to get into Q3; the minimum would be achieving a decent position in Q2, similar to what we had in Barcelona, to allow us to drive into the points in the race. I am confident we can achieve this; the wet conditions always add a variable to the equation, but we will make sure to come prepared.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 MONTREAL, QUEBEC - JUNE 16: Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Canada at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on June 16, 2023 in Montreal, Quebec.

We\u2019ve been working hard trying to find a good set-up. A good balance with the car to feel comfortable is the most important thing, and we were making steps forward. We\u2019ll continue to do that into tomorrow and work hard for a good result in quali.\u201d Oscar Piastri - FP1: 1:21.496, P6; FP2: 1:14.533, P11 \u201cWe had a decent session this afternoon and seemed to be pretty solid out of the box, the pace seemed to be reasonable. It\u2019s a fun track, very bumpy, but I enjoyed getting some time out on-track. The weather came in pretty suddenly at the end, which gave us a taste of wet weather running. We\u2019ll see what the rest of the weekend throws at us but I\u2019d say a reasonably encouraging start.\u201d Andrea Stella, Team Principal \u201cAn unconventional Friday at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. After FP1 was effectively cancelled due to technical issues, we had the compensation of an extended FP2 and extra sets of tyres, which allowed us to run through a large part of our programme. We couldn\u2019t do everything that we wanted but despite that, I think we\u2019ve gained a good understanding of performance potential, set-up direction and the behaviour of the tyres. The rain at the end also allowed us to check the Intermediate tyres, so taken all together we\u2019ve gathered quite a lot of information from practice today. We\u2019ll study it overnight and try to be ready for whatever we face in qualifying and the race.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 MONTREAL, QUEBEC - JUNE 16: Lando Norris of Great Britain driving the (4) McLaren MCL60 Mercedes on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Canada at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on June 16, 2023 in Montreal, Quebec.

Tsunoda ran wide at Turn 1 and had to bounce across the grass during the second session, and wasn\u2019t able to set a fully clean lap on the softs. As such, AlphaTauri\u2019s place in the pecking order is a slight mystery. Nyck de Vries - FP1: 1:32.274, P12; FP2: 1:15.002, P16 \u201cI think it was a challenging day for everyone. Obviously, FP1 was interrupted so we had to change our run plan for the afternoon but nonetheless, I think we completed enough laps to be able to get up to speed with the track. Tomorrow will see different conditions again with rain forecasted, so there is lots of work ahead of us. As the track is quite different compared to Barcelona, more bumpy, narrow, and with less grip, I will have to get used to it and make the necessary changes. We didn\u2019t do any laps in the rain today, but the grip seems low in dry conditions already, so we will have to see how it goes in the wet.\u201d Yuki Tsunoda - FP1: No time set; FP2: 1:14.941, P15 \u201cAlthough FP1 was interrupted, we still had two hours of running on track, which was enough. Our balance isn\u2019t too bad, but it seems we are struggling to find pace during our performance runs. It looks like it will be raining tomorrow so we will be focusing on wet conditions for one-lap runs, with multiple tyre sets left to use. We did some long runs in the dry, and the pace doesn\u2019t seem bad, but first, let\u2019s see how tomorrow goes. I hope we can achieve Q2 or Q3 tomorrow.\u201d Jonathan Eddolls, Chief Race Engineer \u201cIt\u2019s been a very different Friday to usual here in Canada. In FP1 we managed to get our planned aero rake running completed before the red flag, and then it was a case of waiting in the garage while the circuit resolved the CCTV issues. These were not fixed in time, but the plan to extend FP2 and start the session 30 minutes earlier was a very good decision, because we knew the chances of rain later in the afternoon were high. We were able to carry FP1 tyres into FP2, which was now 90 minutes long, so we had three brand new sets and one nearly new set of tyres to use. The plan focused on giving the drivers as many laps as possible, with short runs and pitstops on the four sets of tyres, before turning our attention to the long runs. We were tracking the rain and could see it coming towards the end of the session, so the run plans were geared around this and we managed to cover all the planned work. The track was declared wet, so to get our \"free\" intermediate tyres for tomorrow, we had to complete one lap on it. This was done in the dry because we didn\u2019t want to risk a red flag and miss the opportunity. Overall, we were expecting a bit more pace than we showed, but given the dense programme, we didn\u2019t focus on setup changes. I think we can make a step forward tomorrow with changes to the car overnight.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 MONTREAL, QUEBEC - JUNE 16: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan and Scuderia AlphaTauri prepares to drive in the garage during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Canada at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on June 16, 2023 in Montreal, Quebec.

His smouldering Haas was recovered to the pits, and it looks like his mechanics will be in for a late night repairing all the damage. Magnussen at least had a decent day, winding up on the fringes of the top 10 at a track that the team hope will suit their car slightly more than Barcelona did. FP2: Session red flagged as Hulkenberg\u2019s smoking Haas stops on track Nico Hulkenberg - FP1: 1:24.336, P8; FP2: 1:16.369, P20 \u201cIt was a very disruptive day, obviously for everyone in FP1 with just one lap and then the technical problems we faced, we got compromised there. Then FP2 also didn\u2019t last very long, I got one run in and then starting the second one the ICU failed. It\u2019s not ideal obviously heading into the rest of the weekend but it is what it is now, we\u2019ll see what the other car did, try to learn from that and come up with the best possible package we can tomorrow.\u201d Kevin Magnussen \u2013 FP1: 1:24.045, P7; FP2: 1:14.544, P12 \u201cToday was interrupted by different things, obviously in FP1 and then also in FP2 with both the weather and Nico\u2019s car, but we still got most of the stuff done. We got some low-fuel and high-fuel running on both compounds so although disrupted, we got everything we wanted, and it looked okay. We have more running tomorrow, although it looks to be wet, so it\u2019s going to be an exciting qualifying.\u201d Guenther Steiner, Team Principal \u201cIt was a very disruptive day today, starting off with some of FP1\u2019s lost run time being merged with FP2 which was very disruptive for us. FP2 wasn\u2019t ideal because Nico\u2019s ICU expired, shortening his session, and we only had one car to gather data and we had a lot of stuff we wanted to test. We didn\u2019t get any definitive answers. Kevin did a good job, but we would\u2019ve liked to have done more work with two cars across two sessions.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 3 MONTREAL, QUEBEC - JUNE 16: Track marshals use fire extinguishers on the car of Nico Hulkenberg of Germany and Haas F1 during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Canada at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on June 16, 2023 in Montreal, Quebec.

They only have one set, so Sargeant is going to have to wait until Silverstone to get his hands on them. It will be interesting to see what they are worth when those two set representative lap times tomorrow. Logan Sargeant - FP1: No time set; FP2: 1:15.426, P19 \"It was an interrupted first day in Montreal, but we made the most of it in FP2 and got a lot of laps in. The car felt pretty good for the most part. There\u2019s more to come from my side taking a bit of margin in my first session. We\u2019re in a good place heading into tomorrow however it should be pretty wet so we\u2019re going to have to wait and see what the conditions are actually like.\" Alex Albon - FP1: No time set; FP2: 1:15.003, P17 \"The disrupted day hasn\u2019t hurt us too much. We did a lot of simulator practice and it\u2019s kind of what I expected so there haven\u2019t been any nasty surprises with the car, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t really complete a proper FP2, so we didn\u2019t put on a proper set of tyres, but otherwise we\u2019re not in a bad place.\" Dave Robson, Head of Vehicle Performance \"It was a slightly odd day with FP1 effectively cancelled and FP2 affected by rain. We got most of the work done as we had intended, but stopped the low fuel running early in FP2 to concentrate on the high fuel work. \"The upgrades ran well on Alex\u2019s car and will remain fitted for the rest of the weekend. We\u2019ll go through the data tonight and confirm that the performance is matching the wind tunnel data and we will look to refine the setup to maximise the overall pace. \"The weather looks mixed for the rest of the weekend with more heavy rain expected tonight and into tomorrow morning. There could be further heavy showers during qualifying, which will keep things interesting.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 MONTREAL, QUEBEC - JUNE 16: Alexander Albon of Thailand driving the (23) Williams FW45 Mercedes on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Canada at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on June 16, 2023 in Montreal, Quebec.

I\u2019m in a great team of great people and am often given the opportunity to race towards the front.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had many opportunities with Haas and I see a great future for MoneyGram Haas F1 Team. I very much hope I can be a part of that and live to see the fruits of all the hard work and progress that\u2019s being made at the moment.\u201d\n\nHis failure to start the 2015 Australian Grand Prix, where a mechanical issue forced his retirement on the way to the grid, means it will be the Austrian Grand Prix at the beginning of July where he would be able to start a hundred and fifty races.\n\nLooking ahead to this weekend\u2019s race at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, Magnussen says he prefers this kind of circuit, a track that has character and offers good racing and sometimes even mixed weather conditions.\n\n\u201cI personally like most of the older circuits, those that have a bit more character and aren\u2019t as flat and wide as many of the newer tracks,\u201d Magnussen added. \u201cThe Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve is definitely one of those and it\u2019s a track that is very good for racing with the long straight.\n\n\u201cThere are always good opportunities for overtaking and it\u2019s never a dull race. There\u2019s also often a good chance of changing weather and generally, it\u2019s a great atmosphere at the Canadian Grand Prix.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re struggling on some tracks with our tyre management\u201d \u2013 Nico H\u00fclkenberg\n\nTeam-mate Nico H\u00fclkenberg has reiterated his desire for Haas to solve its lack of pace over long runs so far in 2023, particularly after some stunning Qualifying displays from the German in the opening part of the season.\n\nH\u00fclkenberg qualified seventh on the grid last time out in Spain but fell to fifteenth after struggles with tyre degradation, and he says he would love to find solutions to their tyre woes so they can fight for top ten finishes.\n\n\u201cI often feel really comfortable in the car over one lap,\u201d said H\u00fclkenberg. \u201cWe\u2019re getting the tyres up to the right temperature quickly and I can squeeze everything out.\n\n\u201cOn the long runs, however, we\u2019re struggling on some tracks with our tyre management. That\u2019s definitely an area where we want to improve.\u201d\n\nH\u00fclkenberg says the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve is one of his favourite venues on the Formula 1 calendar, and he enjoys the warm welcome that the Canadian locals give the drivers.\n\n\u201cMontreal is one of my favourites \u2013 it\u2019s a track with a really nice flow and a great mix of street circuit and a race track,\u201d he added. \u201cAround the track, you can see how much Canada loves Formula 1.\n\n\u201cThe whole city embraces the race and the locals give us a very warm welcome.\u201d",

            "text": "Formula 1 teams believe a leading American driver would be better for the championship than adding a team such as Andretti Cadillac, as doubts remain over the benefit of such an entry.\n\nThe General Motors-backed Andretti Global bid is one of several applicants for a slot on the F1 grid after the FIA started a formal process to evaluate potential new entries earlier this year.\n\nOther known applicants include the prolific junior single-seater team Hitech and the supposedly Asian state-backed LKY SUNZ project.\n\nAndretti Cadillac F1 bid has a \u2018surprise\u2019 \u2013 but is it enough? Read more\n\nAndretti teamed up with GM to enter under the Andretti Cadillac name, using the luxury vehicle brand that has an increasing presence in the sportscar world and finished third at this year\u2019s Le Mans 24 Hours.\n\nThe belief was that securing the support of a major American manufacturer would tick the final box and show F1\u2019s stakeholders that the entry would not just be successful but grow the championship in the US and attract other big brands as well.\n\nAs the FIA\u2019s evaluation process draws to a close, Ferrari and Mercedes have questioned whether a US team would bring that much, while Red Bull has once again raised a concern over whether it is a real General Motors effort or just a \u201cbadging exercise\u201d.\n\nFred Vasseur, the Ferrari team principal who was in charge of Sauber when that team was saved from financial ruin in 2017, said: \u201cTen teams made huge efforts even when it was tough to be on the grid, and to survive.\n\n\u201cIf we have to welcome another team, it has to be for mega good reasons.\n\n\u201cThe fact that you have an American team is not a good reason.\n\n\u201cFirst, we have an American team, thanks to Haas. And the second one is that if you want to be at the top in the country, it\u2019s a matter of drivers.\n\n\u201cHave a look at what\u2019s happened in the Netherlands. It\u2019s the biggest success of the world today, and they don\u2019t have a team, they have Max.\n\n\u201cFirst, we have had good success in the US. If you want to increase the success in the US, it\u2019s more a matter for me to have an American driver. It\u2019s not about the team.\u201d\n\nHe added on Friday at the British Grand Prix\u2019s team boss press conference: \u201cWe didn\u2019t change position at all. It could make sense for F1 only if it\u2019s a huge push in every single direction.\n\n\u201cVery often we are speaking about the nationality of the team. But for me, it\u2019s absolutely not an argument.\n\n\u201cF1 is not just a UK championship because we have 70% of the teams being based in the UK.\n\n\u201cThe attraction of F1 is much more based on the nationality of drivers. And it\u2019s nothing to do with the nationality of the team.\u201d\n\nVasseur\u2019s stance was backed up by Mercedes team boss and co-owner Toto Wolff, who also reiterated that his position is for the current interested parties to \u201cbuy a team\u201d instead of starting a new one.\n\nWolff said he believes that F1 would be better off creating a system that develops and facilitates more American drivers.\n\nF1 missed out on IndyCar race winner Colton Herta switching series because he is ineligible for a superlicence under the current flawed criteria, although Williams driver Logan Sargeant has this year become the first full-time American in F1 since Scott Speed in 2007.\n\n\u201cObviously our standpoint is clear, because we would only want to have a team that brings something to the cake \u2013 an eleventh team brings more than what they cost the other teams, more show, more exciting drivers,\u201d said Wolff.\n\n\u201cLike Fred said, the team\u2019s nationality plays no role.\n\n\u201cWe have had an American team [Haas] for a long time, we need to have a good points system that we attract more drivers from the US, that will make them eligible for a superlicence.\n\n\u201cWe need to support young drivers like Logan Sargeant to give them enough time.

It&#8217;s clear drivers want to race. But most drivers are reluctant to have 24 weekends of everything a modern F1 weekend now entails; racing is only a small part of it in the end.</p>\n<p>And they also acknowledge it&#8217;s &#8220;extremely tough for everyone&#8221; else in the team.

            "text": "Fernando Alonso thinks 18 Formula 1 races a year is enough, Lando Norris says 20 would be a \u201cgood number\u201d and Max Verstappen says 24 is \u201ctoo many for me\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to find real enthusiasm among drivers about F1 announcing its longest-ever calendar for 2024, with January the only clear month without racing or pre-season testing.\n\nPierre Gasly paused when asked for his thoughts on the 24-race schedule and understandably went for the \u201clet\u2019s say I love racing so I\u2019m happy to race\u201d argument. It\u2019s clear drivers want to race. But most drivers are reluctant to have 24 weekends of everything a modern F1 weekend now entails; racing is only a small part of it in the end.\n\nAnd they also acknowledge it\u2019s \u201cextremely tough for everyone\u201d else in the team. As Gasly noted, it\u2019s both a \u201cphysical and mental\u201d challenge.\n\n\u201cTwenty is a good number also for the lives of mechanics, engineers, everyone that travels,\u201d McLaren driver Norris said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re away from families, kids for so [many] days. More days than us drivers are away. It\u2019s tougher for them, when we talk about things, we almost speak as more voices for them than probably for ourselves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see they [F1] have put some effort into organising it in a slightly better way but still it\u2019s a tough calendar, longest we\u2019ve had. I\u2019d say 20 is a better number for everyone, for the health of all the Formula 1 people.\u201d\n\nAlonso concurred: \u201cMore than 18, 19 and you start stressing the mechanics, media, everyone is just on the back foot from February to December.\u201d\n\nRussell says Verstappen\u2019s F1 retirement talk a \u2018tactic\u2019 Read more\n\nHe said drivers have the \u201ccomfort\u201d to not complain but it\u2019s not the same for other members of the team.\n\nBut does the greater variety of the format in recent years \u2013 variety that\u2019s only going to increase next year with two extra Saturday races to start the season \u2013 make having so many races more palatable?\n\n\u201cThere is also a saturation factor. How we have the races at the moment, if we had 24 races all the same I think we would already have too many but because they\u2019re so different now, people always look forward to something,\u201d Haas team principal Guenther Steiner argued.\n\n\u201cSix sprint weekends, then they have got the night race. Now next year we\u2019ve got three Saturday races [Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Las Vegas].\n\n\u201cA little bit of a mix. You always have something special to look forward to.\n\n\u201cBut can you imagine 24 races in the old days when it was all cookie cutter, start at 3pm, finish at 5pm. You would say after 20 \u2018I\u2019ve had enough\u2019 but now there\u2019s also some newness, different thing in there, which makes it interesting.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s probably some truth to what Steiner is saying in the respect that sprint weekends have sometimes mixed up grand prix weekends potentially beyond the way a standard format would, and have certainly made Fridays more interesting.

AlphaTauri \u2013 2\n\nHulkenberg\u2019s starring role in sprint qualifying \u2013 using medium tyres to qualify fourth ahead of both Ferraris \u2013 set him up well, as did \u201cannoying\u201d Sergio Perez on the opening lap by passing both the Red Bull driver and Lando Norris\u2019s McLaren for second place.\n\n\u201cI saw that they\u2019re [Perez and Verstappen] close, that they\u2019re battling, they\u2019re going wide in Turn 2 and then decided [to go] for the inside line in Turn 3 and stayed tight and picked up Checo\u2019s position,\u201d Hulkenberg said when The Race asked about the move.\n\n\u201cWhich probably would have really annoyed him, he lost a lot of time behind me!\u201d\n\nPerez spent almost 12 laps behind his old team-mate before passing him as the track began to dry and Haas\u2019s usual 2023 flaw reared its head, with Hulkenberg\u2019s intermediates overheating.\n\nHad it remained wet it could have been a very different story \u2013 the wet track masks Haas\u2019s primary weakness and further rain could have given Hulkenberg half a sniff of an even better finish.\n\nMark Hughes: Sprint dilemma doomed some \u2013 and saved others Read more\n\nBut instead the drying track left Hulkenberg vulnerable to the cars behind \u2013 he lost third to Carlos Sainz on the next lap and then pitted three laps later as the Aston Martins swallowed him.\n\nHulkenberg was losing two seconds per lap to Perez in the five laps after Perez passed him \u2013 and more importantly a reasonable chunk of time to the Williams of Alex Albon behind \u2013 forcing Haas into the \u201conly decision\u201d it could take in pitting Hulkenberg for slicks.\n\nHowever, to give away a points-paying position to a direct rival in Williams so early in the crossover phase \u2013 only two drivers had pitted at that point \u2013 was the kind of proactive decision-making that makes the difference in F1\u2019s ultra-tight midfield.\n\nAlbon had been doing Hulkenberg a favour in holding up a train of faster cars like Esteban Ocon\u2019s Alpine and Charles Leclerc\u2019s Ferrari. He wasn\u2019t facing anywhere near the same level of degradation as Hulkenberg, saying he would have \u201ccomfortably held off Esteban\u201d had Williams not pitted him two laps after Hulkenberg.\n\n\u201cWe should\u2019ve left him out on the inters but we were expecting more degradation than there actually was,\u201d Dave Robson head of vehicle performance at Williams admitted.\n\n\u201cWe could\u2019ve got a point or two today, so we need to have a look at what we did.\u201d\n\nWolff: No chance \u2018frightened\u2019 Red Bull gets key \u201926 engine wish Read more\n\nWilliams\u2019 error and Haas\u2019s correct call \u2013 even if it was one encouraged by its primary weakness \u2013 proved to cause a crucial swing in the lower half of the constructors\u2019 table. Instead of Williams jumping Haas with a couple of sprint race points for eighth place, Haas\u2019s three points for sixth lift it from eighth to seventh ahead of Alfa Romeo \u2013 who locked out the last two places in the sprint.\n\nAny chance of Alfa rescuing anything from its torrid sprint qualifying was ruined by it inexplicably fitting Valtteri Bottas with slicks for the start, a strategy it abandoned before the race even began with a formation lap pitstop.\n\nUltimately Haas triumphed in a game of tight strategy calls and Hulkenberg helped it all along with arguably the best day of his comeback so far, while team-mate Magnussen was unable to make the same impression on the points places.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the kind of morale-boosting performance that suggests Haas\u2019s season is going to turn around nor that recent upgrades have cured its tyre degradation woes.\n\nHaas still has a fundamental problem with its 2023 car. It will likely continue to qualify strongly and then capitulate in the race.\n\nIn fact the latest example of that will probably come in the grand prix later today \u2013 with Hulkenberg starting eighth but facing a mammoth task to remain in the top 10 with the Red Bull Ring\u2019s final two corners in particular likely to punish Haas\u2019s tyres.\n\nGary Anderson: What Ferrari\u2019s aiming for with Austria upgrades Read more\n\nOvertaking has never been much of a problem here, particularly when there\u2019s the kind of tyre offset that a tyre-chewing VF-23 can create.\n\nFixing that is likely to be a long-term problem, one that until addressed will be the cause of plenty more pain aside from very particular circumstances and conditions \u2013 namely low track temperatures and/or a consistently wet track.\n\nWhen you consider each upcoming track on the calendar in turn there are very few where you\u2019d bet on Haas\u2019s tyre-chewing not manifesting in a damaging way. Perhaps a cold Spa or Monza is its best hope but even the typically low-deg Montreal circuit proved troublesome for Haas\u2019s rear tyres when others went unscathed.\n\nSo Haas may be thankful come the end of the season that it maximised and salvaged this rare opportunity.\n\nThree points is exactly the kind of margin that could separate any of the teams seventh-10th \u2013 if we presume the upgraded McLaren has the legs to stretch an advantage over them \u2013 by the end of the year.\n\nSo Hulkenberg and Haas can be delighted with their stellar efforts but deep down they\u2019ll know their painful 2023 trend is only going to continue.",

With Gene we can talk for hours, he will always think \u2018have you thought about this, have you thought about that\u2019, which is good, because it shows he is keen that we do better.\u201d\n\nSteiner is optimistic that Haas\u2019 VF-22 car \"can be pretty good\" in Austin.\n\nSteiner is optimistic that Haas\u2019 VF-22 car \"can be pretty good\" in Austin, raising the prospect of a points challenge, while attention turns to long-term ambitions.\n\n\"Success is points, and at the moment we have this rollercoaster ride and hopefully at some stage we can make it flat in the life of Haas,\" says Steiner.\n\nWell, how?\n\n\"It just comes over time by making less mistakes. You cannot keep on doing this other than getting better over time. Every time you mess something up analyze why, try and find solutions not to do it wrong next time\u2014that comes from doing it.\"\n\nFormula 1\u2019s cost cap should also aid prospects long-term. It was introduced at a base price of $145 million in 2021, reduced to $140 million in 2022, and $135 million from 2023. It has curbed the frivolous spending of the top teams.\n\n\"Short-term, the big teams will have an advantage because they have so much momentum going, but mid-long term I think if you do a good job you can do it,\" says Steiner. \"We are not a lot under the budget cap, maybe now we are 10% off the other people but before we were 200% off. At some stage, it will come together.\u201d\n\nMick Schumacher might be heading into his final four races for Haas, which has yet to commit to the driver for 2023. TOSHIFUMI KITAMURA // Getty Images\n\nDriver speculation is inevitably part of the game. Magnussen is on a multi-year deal but Schumacher\u2019s place remains uncertain. When repeatedly quizzed in recent weeks Steiner has been coy on driver matters, insisting that Haas is in no rush to settle matters, an astute stance given Williams\u2014last in the standings\u2014is the only other team with a vacancy. Schumacher\u2019s first part of the season \u201cwas not easy for him or the team,\u201d says Steiner, but \u201che made a lot of progress there, and it\u2019s just now we need to stabilize that progress.\u201d\n\nIt is believed that retaining Schumacher, or recruiting veteran Nico Hulkenberg, is at the heart of the team\u2019s driver decision.\n\nFirst up, though, is the US Grand Prix, where Haas is chasing its first points since 2016. If it can achieve the feat then it\u2019d be quite the turnaround from 12 months ago.",

That has been one of the aims with this new project to be able to have a stronger in-season development programme.\"\n\nNew Haas changes\n\nKevin Magnussen, Haas F1 Team Photo by: Haas F1 Team\n\nThe new Haas VF-23 ran for the first time at Silverstone on Saturday and featured some key visual changes to last year's challenger.\n\nIn philosophy terms, Resta says it is just an evolution \u2013 but he is clear that a lot of detailed work has gone on to find both aero and weight improvements.\n\n\"We try to save a few of the components on last season's car but try to improve the aerodynamic performance of the car, improve the weight of the component and improve the quality of the component,\" he said.\n\n\"There has been a massive rework of the car \u2013 some of the components don't look radically different \u2013 it's probably more a development of the 2022 car but there is a complete rework of the car involving many, many components.\"",

Led by founder and Creative Director Francesco Ragazzi, Palm Angels will become the official \u201cEntArtainment Curator\u201d for the F1 team, offering creative input for its VF-23 racecar, driver overalls, garage, hospitality branding, and owned channels.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to welcome Palm Angels to Haas F1 Team and I know it\u2019s a partnership that will bring a totally different dynamic into the Formula 1 paddock,\u201d said Team Principal of Haas F1 Team, Guenther Steiner. \u201cAs a brand, Palm Angels has enjoyed tremendous growth in a short space of time and it\u2019s not been afraid to do things its own way \u2013 not unlike Haas F1 Team.\u201d\n\nUnder the motto \u201cRight on Track,\u201d Palm Angels is also set to assist Haas in key activations throughout the season including the Miami, Italian, and Las Vegas Grand Prix. Capitalizing on their individual strengths and shared qualities, the mission is to work together to build a strong visual identity and success-driven mentality.\n\n\u201cOur identity lies in multiplicity, and I believe in Palm Angels being essentially a perspective onto things, a diverse but precise point of view,\u201d says Ragazzi. \u201cCuration is the right way to define my approach and I do often use an image to describe what we do: many different things that magically come together by the simple fact of being one next to the other. The partnership with Haas F1 Team will allow us to delve into both the material and the immaterial, creating a synergy based on optimism and dynamism. These qualities define both Palm Angels as a brand and Haas F1 as team. I completely adhere to the belief that speed is an expression of everything positive. We\u2019ll move across different media, and I am sure we will all have great time together.\u201d\n\nLook for the Palm Angels\u2019 touch to begin appearing on Haas F1 Team\u2019s physical and digital showings next season.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Palm Angels (@palmangels)\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Palm Angels (@palmangels)\n\nElsewhere, Daniel Ricciardo is set to return to Red Bull as a third driver.",

The team in orange seemed to struggle with aerodynamic efficiency and further issues sprung up at the front of the car with their front wheel brows needing strengthening, which hampered rookie Oscar Piastri and team mate Lando Norris.</p>\n<p>As a result, McLaren managed just 312 laps over the three days and our data put them in the bottom half. Perhaps they didn't get a representative quali or race run in, but it's not a great start for the Woking team.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.more-points-and-prizes-mini-leagues-and-boosters-how-to-get-the-most-out-of.3bJ8nRae206OCbpJ4qLrAX.html\">READ MORE: More points and prizes, mini leagues and boosters &#8211; How to get the most out of F1 Fantasy in 2023</a></strong></p>\n<h3>6.

It's fair to assume that this was not a lap worth reading too much into and our data backs that up, putting Alfa Romeo in the midfield battle.</p>\n<p>But there are reasons to be optimstic for Alfa Romeo and fans of Valtteri Bottas and Zhou, because it does look like they've made some improvements over last year. Two significant reliability issues during the three days of testing might be reason for concern, however.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.watch-jolyon-palmers-testing-takeaways-after-three-busy-days-in-bahrain.1fYJNI5wHJimLu3J9QCvv4.html\">WATCH: Jolyon Palmer&#8217;s testing takeaways after three busy days in Bahrain</a></strong></p>\n<h3>5.

AlphaTauri\n\nAlphaTauri finished ninth in last year's standings \u2013 can they move up the order this season?\n\nAlphaTauri led the mileage stakes in Bahrain with 456 laps of the circuit that will also host this weekend's season-opener. Yuki Tsunoda and rookie team mate Nyck de Vries clearly encountered no bugs with their AT04, but the team's pace was hard to read as Tsunoda managed a fast flying lap only at the end of the third day \u2013 which might have been a low-fuel quali run. So we haven't had a proper read on the Faenza team's pace, but our preliminary data hints that they're only just above Haas and Williams in the stakes. Again, the same caveats as above apply in this tight midfield scrap. ANALYSIS: How do McLaren, Haas, AlphaTauri and more stack up after pre-season testing in Bahrain? 7. McLaren\n\nNot the ideal start for McLaren, who pushed for P4 in the standings last season\n\nMcLaren were one of the surprises from pre-season testing, and not for the reasons they would have liked. The team in orange seemed to struggle with aerodynamic efficiency and further issues sprung up at the front of the car with their front wheel brows needing strengthening, which hampered rookie Oscar Piastri and team mate Lando Norris. As a result, McLaren managed just 312 laps over the three days and our data put them in the bottom half. Perhaps they didn't get a representative quali or race run in, but it's not a great start for the Woking team.

Alfa Romeo\n\nA brace of red flag-triggering issues aside, Alfa Romeo have cause to smile\n\nAlfa Romeo's Zhou Guanyu topped the timesheets on Day 2 with a run on C5 tyres and it would really be something if they do that again in qualifying this Saturday. It's fair to assume that this was not a lap worth reading too much into and our data backs that up, putting Alfa Romeo in the midfield battle. But there are reasons to be optimstic for Alfa Romeo and fans of Valtteri Bottas and Zhou, because it does look like they've made some improvements over last year. Two significant reliability issues during the three days of testing might be reason for concern, however. WATCH: Jolyon Palmer\u2019s testing takeaways after three busy days in Bahrain 5. Alpine\n\nMore to come from last year's midfield-toppers Alpine?\n\nAlpine were bullish during launch season with their engineers showing off numerous aero changes and talking of a significant decrease in weight, but the team didn't seem to show their hand in testing: there were no blistering glory runs and their long runs were hard to read. New signing Pierre Gasly hinted that there was pace in the A523 but that race simulation on the final day was interrupted by a red flag. So our data put the team that finished fourth in last year's constructors' standings one step lower in this year's pre-season Power Rankings. VOTE: Which of the 10 teams impressed you most in 2023 pre-season testing? 4. Aston Martin\n\nAston Martin turned heads in Bahrain testing\n\nAston Martin's AMR23 looks like a big step up from last year's car, which saw the team finish seventh in the standings. Our data puts them fourth in the rankings before the opening Grand Prix \u2013 is that an outlandish or realistic expectation for Lance Stroll and Fernando Alonso? Well, Haas driver Magnussen and Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner have already pointed at Aston Martin as this year's most-improved in testing. It would be far-fetched to expect a Red Bull-beating display from Aston Martin but long runs and short runs were both favourable over the three days. Fernando Alonso was particularly fast and reserve driver Felipe Drugovich was no slouch as he replaced the injured Stroll in testing.

Mercedes\n\nPerhaps Mercedes have more in the tank \u2013 we'll see how they fare soon\n\nSome predictions have put Mercedes behind Aston Martin but our data hints that they might just hold the advantage over the midfield leaders. The eight-time constructors' champions did have a couple of reliability hiccups during the three days of testing, and as the session unfolded they looked a lot happier about their performance. Day 1 wasn't a disaster for the Silver Arrows but only on Friday and Saturday did Lewis Hamilton and George Russell find their feet in the unconventionally-designed W14. They have made strides over 2022 but they're behind Ferrari in our Power Rankings. Although team Principal Toto Wolff hints that there's more to come...

Ferrari\n\nFerrari's boss said the mood in the Scuderia camp was \"perfect\" after 3 days in Bahrain\n\nFerrari set some competitive times, briefly topping sessions throughout the weekend \u2013 but their rivals Red Bull eclipsed them. Furthermore, our data showed that the team in rosso were around the level of Mercedes and, at times, Aston Martin. Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc did have positive things to say about the balance of the SF-23 but as always, Ferrari kept their cards close to their chest. Those positive remarks centered around how \"smooth\" three days in Bahrain went. Last year, we saw Ferrari win the first race of the season at the same circuit as Red Bull were hit by reliability concerns. Will the Scuderia be able to make a winning start again this year?

Can they continue that form in 2023? Max Verstappen will be going all out for a hat-trick of titles, while Sergio Perez will be looking to better the two wins he managed in 2022.\n\nRed Bull will be chasing more trophies in 2023\n\nFerrari Charles Leclerc \u2013 #16\n\nCarlos Sainz \u2013 #55 Ferrari are continuing with the same line-up for a third straight season. They started well in 2022 before their challenge faded, but now have two proven race winners in their ranks thanks to Sainz\u2019s 2022 triumph at Silverstone.

It was the first season in his career that Hamilton failed to either get a pole or a victory, but Russell managed both and is well placed to build on that experience in 2023.

Both drivers have won a race, and both could well be evenly matched, although Ocon will want to use his prior experience at the team to lead the charge. Alpine topped the midfield in 2022, and will expect that at the very minimum in 2023.

The Australian is hot property, with McLaren securing his services over Alpine. Can the team fight their way back to the front of the midfield in 2023? Norris was the only driver outside the big three teams to score a podium in 2022 \u2013 and he\u2019ll want more of those next season.

He joins Magnussen at Haas, the Dane himself a bit of a comeback king.

Steiner explains the team&#8217;s difficult COVID-influenced demise across 2020-21 and planned recovery, its technical restructuring, there is then the saga and <a href=\"https://www.autoweek.com/racing/formula-1/a39667084/haas-f1-driver-mazepin-says-cancel-culture/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"body-link css-p0u9qf et3p2gv0\">fallout surrounding Nikita Mazepin and Uralkali,</a> reliability setbacks and even costly out-of-its-hands freight delays&#8212;before Race 1 of 22 has even taken place. </p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">If something bad is happening, a mechanic quips to Steiner, it is surely happening to Haas.  </p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">The rest of the season is a rollercoaster, from the highs of P5 in Bahrain and shock pole in S&#227;o Paulo, to the lows of point-less runs and Mick Schumacher&#8217;s crashes, estimated to cost Haas $2 million. A running theme of the book post-Uralkali is Haas&#8217; pursuit of a new title sponsor, which eventually comes in the form of MoneyGram, securing Haas a near nine-figure sum for 2023 and beyond. A rival team tries to snatch away the deal, who Steiner claims offers MoneyGram a one-third discount, indicating the politics at play in the paddock. </p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">It is clear throughout that every thought and decision for Steiner is about what is best for Haas and its workforce. </p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">Steiner emerges as not just Haas&#8217; team principal but its public face, a motivator to its personnel, and effectively one of its co-founders given how he lobbied Gene Haas in the early 2010s to enter Formula 1. Their early encounters are relayed, including how Steiner was awoken at 2 a.m. to give a 90-minute presentation to <a href=\"https://www.autoweek.com/racing/formula-1/a40477227/former-f1-boss-bernie-ecclestone-id-still-take-a-bullet-for-vladimir-putin/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"body-link css-p0u9qf et3p2gv0\">then F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone</a> about why Haas should be allowed into the sport. Steiner lives all of Haas&#8217; highs and lows, and is desperate to see the team succeed. &#8220;It&#8217;s the last thing I think about before going to sleep and the first when I wake: (His wife) Gertie, (daughter) Greta, and two hundred employees scattered over the world,&#8221; he writes. </p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">It is also clear that Steiner revels in Haas&#8217; role as an underdog&#8212;something of a disruptor&#8212;and doing so in a quirky and non-corporate manner. It is hard to envisage Steiner slotting in at any other squad (despite having worked at other F1 teams in the past!) while it is equally difficult to imagine Haas with any other figure than Steiner at the helm. He is regularly self-deprecating, describing himself as &#8220;an Italian wanker with a big nose, a weird accent and a German name&#8221; and accepts that his main skill is his ability to talk. </p><img alt=\"f1 grand prix of the netherlands practice\" title=\"F1 Grand Prix of The Netherlands - Practice\" width=\"4334\" height=\"2890\" src=\"https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/guenther-steiner-of-italy-and-haas-f1-and-mick-schumacher-news-photo-1681757016.jpg?crop=1xw:0.84356xh;center,top&amp;resize=980:*\" class=\"css-0 exi4f7p0\"><p class=\"css-9t4b5 e1xqj1sx1\">Steiner writes about his often rocky relationship with former Haas F1 driver Mick Schumacher.</p><p class=\"css-1vlouno e6iqukd2\">Vince Mignott/MB Media</p><p class=\"css-1b9ytva e6iqukd0\">//</p><p class=\"css-1vlouno e6iqukd1\">Getty Images</p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">A theme through the book is the frustration with Mick Schumacher, with whom there appears a disconnect throughout. Steiner wills Schumacher to step up but doubts seep in as early as the fourth round at Imola, in April, with those worries exploding after Schumacher&#8217;s violent accident in Monaco.</p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">&#8220;Mick seems unable to appreciate the gravity of the situation, at least publicly, which is also worrying,&#8221; Steiner writes after pondering Schumacher&#8217;s second car major crash, forcing him to think &#8220;something&#8217;s not right here.&#8221; The youngster&#8217;s in-lap crash at a wet Suzuka practice appears the end of his chances as Steiner writes &#8220;I cannot have a driver who I am not confident can take a car around safely on a slow lap.&#8221;</p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">Schumacher&#8217;s contract was not extended for 2023 and he was replaced by Nico Hulkenberg. </p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\"><a href=\"https://www.autoweek.com/racing/formula-1/a40671201/kevin-magnussen-haas-2023-mick-schumachers-future/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"body-link css-p0u9qf et3p2gv0\">Kevin Magnussen takes flak </a>at stages too, especially during a run of avoidable incidents, at which the &#8220;dedication and right attitude&#8221; of both drivers is pondered. Is it what separates the good drivers from the very top drivers, wonders Steiner, referencing the relentless Fernando Alonso. Steiner also suggests Magnussen has become slightly complacent at stages and reckons the recruitment of Hulkenberg will make him up his game. There is nevertheless a clear fondness for &#8220;the miniature Viking&#8221; given their lengthy history.   </p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">There is understandable praise and warmth for Gene Haas&#8217; vision, commitment and calmness&#8212;chalk and cheese to the ever-animated Steiner&#8212;and Ferrari for its willingness to partner with Haas when it was striving to join Formula 1.  </p><img alt=\"f1 grand prix of spain\" title=\"F1 Grand Prix of Spain\" width=\"4928\" height=\"3280\" src=\"https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gunther-steiner-of-haas-f1-team-arrive-into-the-circuit-news-photo-1681757255.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.849xh;0,0.0313xh&amp;resize=980:*\" class=\"css-0 exi4f7p0\"><p class=\"css-9t4b5 e1xqj1sx1\">Guenther Steiner is one of the more outspoken team principals in the F1 paddock.</p><p class=\"css-1vlouno e6iqukd2\">NurPhoto</p><p class=\"css-1b9ytva e6iqukd0\">//</p><p class=\"css-1vlouno e6iqukd1\">Getty Images</p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">Conversely there are various personnel or parties that receive Steiner&#8217;s ire throughout the year, including then McLaren boss Andreas Seidl, the FIA&#8217;s stewards&#8212;&#8220;if we were as consistently good as they are poor we&#8217;d be a top-three team&#8221; &#8212;fawning driver managers, and arrogant celebrities. Special disdain, though, is reserved for Mick Schumacher&#8217;s uncle, Ralf, on account of regular criticism of Steiner. Maybe Ralf &#8220;could help his nephew and bring something to the table, instead of just trying to stir shit all the time,&#8221; Steiner writes in Austin. </p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">After announcing Mick&#8217;s departure, Steiner reveals his admiration at how Mick has handled the pressure of a surname before quipping &#8220;his entourage and supporters, perhaps not so much.&#8221;</p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">Steiner intersperses some of the more humdrum days at grands prix with tales from his rallying years&#8212;his experience of a Dakar Rally disaster is extraordinary&#8212;his bafflement at the fame that his Haas role and DTS popularity has brought, as well as how he balances family life with 10 months of the year on the road.

His no-nonsense approach, distinctive demeanor, and penchant for a profanity earned him a legion of fans.\n\nAnd the publishers lucked into a 2022 campaign that had \u201cmore drama in it than a thousand episodes of a foking Mexican soap opera\u201d for Haas, as Steiner pens it.\n\n\n\nAudible Surviving to Drive Audible Surviving to Drive Now 13% Off $27 at Amazon\n\nIt is easy, in April 2023, to forget how much happened to Haas, especially early in 2022. Steiner explains the team\u2019s difficult COVID-influenced demise across 2020-21 and planned recovery, its technical restructuring, there is then the saga and fallout surrounding Nikita Mazepin and Uralkali, reliability setbacks and even costly out-of-its-hands freight delays\u2014before Race 1 of 22 has even taken place.\n\nIf something bad is happening, a mechanic quips to Steiner, it is surely happening to Haas.\n\nThe rest of the season is a rollercoaster, from the highs of P5 in Bahrain and shock pole in S\u00e3o Paulo, to the lows of point-less runs and Mick Schumacher\u2019s crashes, estimated to cost Haas $2 million. A running theme of the book post-Uralkali is Haas\u2019 pursuit of a new title sponsor, which eventually comes in the form of MoneyGram, securing Haas a near nine-figure sum for 2023 and beyond. A rival team tries to snatch away the deal, who Steiner claims offers MoneyGram a one-third discount, indicating the politics at play in the paddock.\n\nIt is clear throughout that every thought and decision for Steiner is about what is best for Haas and its workforce.\n\nSteiner emerges as not just Haas\u2019 team principal but its public face, a motivator to its personnel, and effectively one of its co-founders given how he lobbied Gene Haas in the early 2010s to enter Formula 1. Their early encounters are relayed, including how Steiner was awoken at 2 a.m. to give a 90-minute presentation to then F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone about why Haas should be allowed into the sport. Steiner lives all of Haas\u2019 highs and lows, and is desperate to see the team succeed. \u201cIt\u2019s the last thing I think about before going to sleep and the first when I wake: (His wife) Gertie, (daughter) Greta, and two hundred employees scattered over the world,\u201d he writes.\n\nIt is also clear that Steiner revels in Haas\u2019 role as an underdog\u2014something of a disruptor\u2014and doing so in a quirky and non-corporate manner. It is hard to envisage Steiner slotting in at any other squad (despite having worked at other F1 teams in the past!) while it is equally difficult to imagine Haas with any other figure than Steiner at the helm. He is regularly self-deprecating, describing himself as \u201can Italian wanker with a big nose, a weird accent and a German name\u201d and accepts that his main skill is his ability to talk.\n\nSteiner writes about his often rocky relationship with former Haas F1 driver Mick Schumacher. Vince Mignott/MB Media // Getty Images\n\nA theme through the book is the frustration with Mick Schumacher, with whom there appears a disconnect throughout. Steiner wills Schumacher to step up but doubts seep in as early as the fourth round at Imola, in April, with those worries exploding after Schumacher\u2019s violent accident in Monaco.\n\n\u201cMick seems unable to appreciate the gravity of the situation, at least publicly, which is also worrying,\u201d Steiner writes after pondering Schumacher\u2019s second car major crash, forcing him to think \u201csomething\u2019s not right here.\u201d The youngster\u2019s in-lap crash at a wet Suzuka practice appears the end of his chances as Steiner writes \u201cI cannot have a driver who I am not confident can take a car around safely on a slow lap.\u201d\n\nSchumacher\u2019s contract was not extended for 2023 and he was replaced by Nico Hulkenberg.\n\nKevin Magnussen takes flak at stages too, especially during a run of avoidable incidents, at which the \u201cdedication and right attitude\u201d of both drivers is pondered. Is it what separates the good drivers from the very top drivers, wonders Steiner, referencing the relentless Fernando Alonso. Steiner also suggests Magnussen has become slightly complacent at stages and reckons the recruitment of Hulkenberg will make him up his game. There is nevertheless a clear fondness for \u201cthe miniature Viking\u201d given their lengthy history.\n\nThere is understandable praise and warmth for Gene Haas\u2019 vision, commitment and calmness\u2014chalk and cheese to the ever-animated Steiner\u2014and Ferrari for its willingness to partner with Haas when it was striving to join Formula 1.\n\nGuenther Steiner is one of the more outspoken team principals in the F1 paddock. NurPhoto // Getty Images\n\nConversely there are various personnel or parties that receive Steiner\u2019s ire throughout the year, including then McLaren boss Andreas Seidl, the FIA\u2019s stewards\u2014\u201cif we were as consistently good as they are poor we\u2019d be a top-three team\u201d \u2014fawning driver managers, and arrogant celebrities. Special disdain, though, is reserved for Mick Schumacher\u2019s uncle, Ralf, on account of regular criticism of Steiner. Maybe Ralf \u201ccould help his nephew and bring something to the table, instead of just trying to stir shit all the time,\u201d Steiner writes in Austin.\n\nAfter announcing Mick\u2019s departure, Steiner reveals his admiration at how Mick has handled the pressure of a surname before quipping \u201chis entourage and supporters, perhaps not so much.\u201d\n\nSteiner intersperses some of the more humdrum days at grands prix with tales from his rallying years\u2014his experience of a Dakar Rally disaster is extraordinary\u2014his bafflement at the fame that his Haas role and DTS popularity has brought, as well as how he balances family life with 10 months of the year on the road. Steiner could probably write another book alone with just stories from his disastrous time at Jaguar alongside the late Niki Lauda, who emerges as one of Steiner\u2019s biggest inspirations.\n\nWritten in Steiner\u2019s voice the stylized \u2018fok\u2019 and \u2018jeezos\u2019 can become a little grating through the course of the year, but conversely it does add to the individualistic aura of the book and remind you this is Steiner and no one else.\n\n\u2018Surviving to Drive, A Year Inside Formula 1, by Guenther Steiner\u2019, published by Bantam Press, is available from April 20",

As for Perez, he also started on the mediums so had to be careful off the line from 11th. He climbed back through the field and was chasing hard in the closing stages to try and make it back to the podium, falling a couple of seconds short.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.we-have-to-keep-on-working-verstappen-vows-not-to-ease-off-after-fifth-win.76WRhU7tAE3nwYcp8UyPfJ.html\">READ MORE: &#8216;We have to keep on working&#8217; &#8211; Verstappen vows not to ease off after fifth win of 2023 as he gets set for Mercedes challenge</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Max Verstappen, 1st</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;To win here again feels incredible. It&#8217;s a massive pleasure to drive a car like this. It was important to try and keep the lead into turn one, it was quite tight. From there onwards it was about managing the tyres, I was able to create a big gap. We went on to the hards but I didn&#8217;t seem to have much grip, I was sliding around quite a lot, the pace was okay but I couldn&#8217;t create more of a gap, so we switched to softs and then I just needed to bring it home. We&#8217;ve had another strong weekend and that&#8217;s of course what I like to see for the Team, hopefully we can keep this up throughout the year.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Sergio Perez, 4th</strong></p>\n<p>\"I am disappointed with today, we have ultimately paid the price for a bad qualifying. We did have a good strategy but, looking at where we started from, there was only so much that we could do. I think P3 was possible but, if we wanted more points, then I would have had to take more risks on lap one and potentially compromise my race. George went really deep on that first lap, gaining a lot of positions but we took it easier to ensure we had more of a clean start. Then we got stuck behind the Aston Martin and Fernando was quite hard to pass, so it meant I couldn&#8217;t progress through the field as quickly as we would have liked. This weekend, in general, has been a step back and we weren&#8217;t quite there, but there are plenty of things we can do better. All in all, we brought home twelve points today and I think, looking forward, Canada should be a strong race for us. Everything is pretty close right now so that will be an interesting one.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Christian Horner, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Another great performance from Max. The start was strong, he had to be firm but fair with Carlos into the first turn and from there he managed the race really well. We ran all three compounds today and he had the pace to cover whatever was going on behind him finishing with a 24 second gap by the end of the race. Max was totally in control. But it&#8217;s not just Max, the whole Team is operating at an elite level. We have a phenomenal car, we have two great drivers and we are continuing to evolve and become more polished. It was a good recovery from Checo, especially the second part of the race and I think that will give him a lot more confidence. He had a difficult Monaco, a difficult qualifying but a better Sunday. Looking at the gap between the two drivers, the pressure is off now and we know what Checo is capable of. I&#8217;m sure he will re-find that form from the early races in the near future.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Race winner Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle Red Bull\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Fourth placed Sergio Perez of Mexico and Oracle Red Bull Racing walks\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Race winner Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle Red Bull Racing celebrates in parc ferme during the F1 Grand Prix of Spain at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on June 04, 2023 in Barcelona, Spain.

Luckily that didn&#8217;t damage his W14, as he had some serious pace out there. He was able to run the softs longer than Sainz, which got him ahead of the Ferrari after the first stops, and from there had a lonely race in second. Russell started much further back but was electric off the line, picking up a handful of places despite taking to the escape road through the first few corners. From there he climbed all the way to third with some good overtakes, extracting enough pace at the end to keep Perez at bay.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.hamilton-hails-really-mega-progress-for-mercedes-after-double-podium-in.5oglWxSrTxz4Xr4fgTCp8E.html\">READ MORE: Hamilton hails &#8216;really mega&#8217; progress for Mercedes after double podium in Spain</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Lewis Hamilton, 2nd</strong></p>\n<p>\"I am so happy after today. I didn&#8217;t expect us to come here this weekend and finish second. I was able to keep everything under control today. We couldn&#8217;t keep up with the Red Bull of Max (Verstappen) as they are in another league, but this is still a really positive result. For George to come through from P12 to P3 is also spectacular. I feel incredibly grateful to the whole Team, everyone back at the factory to Team LH all over the world who are always sticking by me.</p>\n<p>\"We are learning more and more about the car. I am hoping that the car continues to be like it was this weekend. I am hoping from here onwards we are in a good place. For sure, there will be some circuits where the car isn&#8217;t quite in the right window but hopefully the next few races should suit us.\"</p>\n<p><strong>George Russell, 3rd</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was a pretty good race today! This morning, I had a lot of confidence that I could move forward from P12 and thought that P5 or P6 was achievable. After a good start, our pace was just there from the very beginning. We knew after Friday that we had good race pace, but you can never be 100 per cent sure if it will translate to the Grand Prix. I was really pleased it did, I was able to make some good overtakes and bring it home on the podium.</p>\n<p>\"This result highlights all the hard work and efforts that have gone on at the factory to bring these upgrades. We had a strong race here last year, so the next couple of races will be key to see if we can consistently produce results like this and close the gap to Red Bull.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport</strong></p>\n<p>\"I&#8217;m really pleased with the hard work that has been done in Brackley and Brixworth, and happy for everyone in the Team. It&#8217;s a good result but we need to be realistic too. The lower temperatures today and on Saturday really suited us; it was nice and fresh, not too hot nor too cold, and the car was in a mega window.</p>\n<p>\"We took a decision to go in another direction early in the season; it was a risky move, but everyone has just pushed forward and we&#8217;ve got a good race car. We now need to just keep chipping away. We are a good Team at grinding away; once there is a clear direction we just go for it. Let&#8217;s keep our expectations real though. We&#8217;ve got a long way to go to catch Red Bull but it&#8217;s good to see we are moving in the right direction.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director</strong></p>\n<p>\"It&#8217;s great to see both cars on the podium again. It&#8217;s been a while! We&#8217;re obviously pleased with the result but it&#8217;s more satisfying to see the progress with the car. The Team have been working flat out since the Bahrain test to bring improvements to the car, and it&#8217;s nice to see that the recent updates appear to have brought performance.</p>\n<p>\"The drivers did a great job balancing the need to push to overtake today with the tyre management requirements. The Team also did really well optimising the race. For sure this track suits the car, especially on the long run, so we&#8217;re realistic about our chances in Montreal. We seem to be moving in the right direction though and that&#8217;s the main thing. We&#8217;ve made good progress in the championship; Max is clearly out of arms reach for us at the moment, but we had fun today and we&#8217;re looking forward to the next races.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Second placed Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain and Mercedes celebrates\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Second placed Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain and Mercedes and Third\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Third placed George Russell of Great Britain and Mercedes celebrates in\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">3</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Second placed Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain and Mercedes celebrates on the podium during the F1 Grand Prix of Spain at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on June 04, 2023 in Barcelona, Spain.

We ran the Hards twice, but with the first set I struggled a lot, while with the second one it was reasonably good and I was catching Pierre (Gasly) towards the end.</p>\n<p>\"We really must analyse all the data, because while the upgrades seem to work as expected, we are always slightly caught out by what is happening with the tyres and we struggle to get them in the right window which is a big problem. We ran the same tyre twice in the same race and we went from having a very bad car to quite a good one towards the end of the race. Now we will go back to the factory and find out what went wrong yesterday in qualifying because that&#8217;s what put us in a tricky situation today. There&#8217;s a lot of work to do.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Carlos Sainz, 5th</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was a tough race. Unfortunately, we couldn&#8217;t fight at the front as our pace is pretty much dictated by tyre management and degradation. I know Sundays have been frustrating so far this season, but we gave it our all on track this weekend and we will keep working on this new package and on developing our car.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you to everyone out there in the grandstands cheering for us every day! It&#8217;s always a pleasure to race at home.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Fred Vasseur, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>\"We made a step forward this weekend in terms of our qualifying pace, with Carlos on the front row after the best Saturday of his season so far. However it is clear that, in terms of race pace, Red Bull and Mercedes are quicker than us. As for the upgrades, I think we have made a step forward overall if you compare this weekend with Miami. Clearly, we know it is still not enough. Our problem is not our outright performance, it is our lack of consistency. Charles&#8217; first set of Hards was a sort of a nightmare but then on his last set of the same compound he was happy with the balance: we must assess this inconsistency. Now we will focus completely on this issue before Canada. For sure we will continue to develop the car but this is a matter of improving by tenths of a second, whereas in the race we are looking for seconds at the moment. There is something in the car that we must unlock if we want to move forward.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: fifth placed Carlos Sainz of Spain and Ferrari walks in parc ferme\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: George Russell of Great Britain driving the (63) Mercedes AMG Petronas\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Charles Leclerc of Monaco driving the (16) Ferrari SF-23 leads Logan\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">3</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: fifth placed Carlos Sainz of Spain and Ferrari walks in parc ferme during the F1 Grand Prix of Spain at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on June 04, 2023 in Barcelona, Spain.

Stroll started and finished sixth, and had Alonso on his tail in the closing stages. The Spaniard had had to work hard, twice pitting into traffic and having to work his way back past the likes of Ocon and Zhou, but despite closing in on his team mate Alonso opted to just bring the car home and make sure the team picked up as many points as they could.</p>\n<p><strong>Fernando Alonso, 7th</strong></p>\n<p>\"We didn&#8217;t have as much pace today on both the Soft and Hard compounds, so it was a tricky race for us. We tried to go longer on our strategy and hoped it would pay off later with fresher tyres, but our rivals had a little more pace. I think sixth and seventh positions were the maximum for us. I thought our performance seemed better in qualifying, so I think we need to look at why and aim to bounce back for Canada. We still scored some solid points and we had no risk at the end of the race. I want to thank the fans for their passion, energy and support this weekend. It was very emotional and special for me.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Lance Stroll, 6th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a fun battle with Lewis [Hamilton] on the first lap; I&#8217;ve pulled that move off before so I knew there was a gap and figured Lewis would leave me a bit of space, which he did. That put me in a good position going into Turn Five and I could hold the place. Then, from about five laps in, we really struggled with the pace. My tyre degradation was higher than expected but the cars around us didn&#8217;t seem to have the same issue, so it&#8217;s something we&#8217;ll look to understand for the coming races. We bring home some good points finishing sixth and seventh, but I think we&#8217;d been hoping for slightly more today. I&#8217;m looking forward to heading to Canada, my home race, in a few days&#8217; time.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Mike Krack, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was good to have both Aston Martins finish well this afternoon and we come away from Barcelona with 14 points. Lance and Fernando pushed hard all afternoon, made some important overtakes, and showed great teamwork. We should not be disappointed with this result &#8211; even though we did not quite have the pace to fight for the podium today. It was in the first stint on the Softs that we did not quite have the performance to catch the cars ahead and in the second and third stints we managed our pace and had a comfortable advantage over the teams behind us. Before we leave Spain, I want to say a big thank you to the passionate fans: their energy has been very motivating throughout this race week, and we have really enjoyed racing here.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Carlos Sainz of Spain and Ferrari and Fernando Alonso of Spain and\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Fernando Alonso of Spain driving the (14) Aston Martin AMR23 Mercedes\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Lance Stroll of Canada driving the (18) Aston Martin AMR23 Mercedes on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">3</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Carlos Sainz of Spain and Ferrari and Fernando Alonso of Spain and Aston Martin F1 Team interact on the grid prior to the F1 Grand Prix of Spain at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on June 04, 2023 in Barcelona, Spain.

But an early pit stop for fresh rubber galvanised him and at times he was the quickest man out there. He climbed back through the field to finish 11th, inheriting P10 thanks to Tsunoda&#8217;s time penalty. As for Ocon, he didn&#8217;t have the pace to keep Russell and Perez at bay, nor Alonso. He did make his former team mate work hard for the place though, pushing him as wide as he dared on the main straight.</p>\n<p><strong>Esteban Ocon, 8th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We leave Barcelona with double points again so I think we can be satisfied with our work this weekend. We finished eighth in the end and I don&#8217;t think there was much more we could have done today, with our race pace perhaps lacking a bit compared to our competitors who finished in front. We&#8217;ll definitely take a look to see how we can improve that but, overall, it was a strong Saturday and a decent Sunday for us. We can be proud of the last couple of weeks but we know there is work to do to keep heading in the right direction.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Pierre Gasly, 10th</strong></p>\n<p>Another double points finish but we always strive for more. On my side, it&#8217;s frustrating after such a strong qualifying yesterday and also the fact we showed good race pace today capable of fighting in the top six. Unfortunately, the penalties and the poor start had a big impact on my race, and we&#8217;ll collectively review to see what we can improve for next time. The car is performing well &#8211; that&#8217;s three points scoring finishes in a row &#8211; and we must keep striving for more. I&#8217;m looking forward to a bit of time off before taking on Canada in two weeks.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Otmar Szafnauer, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We come away from the Spanish Grand Prix with five points after Esteban finished eighth and Pierre tenth. It was a tough race with varying strategies and gameplans. For Esteban he did a good job to be in the mix for the top six, just missing out in the end and there are certainly a couple of aspects from his race to be improved for next time. Pierre already lost six places due to the grid penalty after a superb qualifying yesterday where he was fourth and then lost another four positions on lap one after being caught on the wrong side of a scrum of cars in the opening turns. He did a great job to recover those places in the end to score a point. Of course, we are aiming for more than minor points &#8211; like last week in Monaco &#8211; but the performance of the car is solid and we&#8217;re taking the fight to those ahead. There are some things we must improve &#8211; small details to get right &#8211; and we look forward to racing in Canada later this month ready to keep battling for those higher positions.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Esteban Ocon of France driving the (31) Alpine F1 A523 Renault leads\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Pierre Gasly of France driving the (10) Alpine F1 A523 Renault on track\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Esteban Ocon of France driving the (31) Alpine F1 A523 Renault leads Nico Hulkenberg of Germany driving the (27) Haas F1 VF-23 Ferrari and Zhou Guanyu of China driving the (24) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Spain at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on June 04, 2023 in Barcelona, Spain.

The Finn lacked pace all the way through the race and came home a lowly 19th. But his team mate had a great race &#8211; a brilliant start jumped him forward, and from there Zhou did have the pace, overtaking Hulkenberg twice and making a move on Tsunoda. The AlphaTauri man ran him wide and off the track, picking up a penalty and so Zhou inherited ninth at the flag.</p>\n<p><strong>Valtteri Bottas, 19th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;First of all, congratulations to Zhou and the team for getting points; he showed good pace, and that&#8217;s encouraging for the next races, as proof of the hard work put in by the team back home in Hinwil and here at the track. From my side, we found damage to the floor, probably from some debris picked up at the start of the race, and that cost us quite a big chunk of performance: as a result, I just lacked pace altogether today, I wasn&#8217;t able to put up a fight with anybody and it was quite a long race for me. I know we can put this race behind us and quickly come back on the right track before heading to Montreal in two weeks. The circuit will be once again completely different, and hopefully it&#8217;ll suit our car. We had a decent race in Montreal last year, scoring a very good result for the team: hopefully, we&#8217;ll be able to replicate that, and keep this streak running.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Zhou Guanyu, 9th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I really enjoyed today, it was a well-executed race from my side: I think these have been some of the best two days for me in Formula One, in terms of performance. I had a good first lap, and that was crucial to give us the opportunity to get something out of this race: our pace was strong, although there were times in which we had to manage our tyres wisely. I knew I had to keep the pressure on the others to bring home a result and, when the opportunity was there, I tried to force them to make a mistake. At the end, I knew I had the pace to take Yuki [Tsunoda]: I had DRS, I was half a car ahead going into the corner, but I wasn&#8217;t given any space and didn&#8217;t have any other choice than to take the escape route to avoid contact. In the end, things worked out well and we were able to bring home two points, which was a good result.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Alessandro Alunni Bravi, Team Representative</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Today, we showed that we&#8217;re ready to fight for every single lap, every single tenth of a second on track. We have shown that, working together with determination and as a team, we can deliver the result we all, and our drivers, deserve. The field is very close, we saw that today: every thousandth of a second matters so we need to be aggressive, have a results-driven mentality. We had a hard fight on track with the Haas, the Alpines, the AlphaTauris and to come out of this with points is a very positive result.</p>\n<p>\"Zhou drove very well, pushing every lap and working with the team on how to improve his performance. He is making good progress: especially after a tough weekend in Monaco, he showed the ability to bounce back with confidence and the points he scored are a good reward. Valtteri suffered a difficult Saturday, and today he suffered damage to his car that dashed any hope of a comeback. He will get back stronger in Montreal.</p>\n<p>\"We had a strong race as a team, with the right strategy calls from the pit-wall and good execution. The team worked really hard and we&#8217;re grateful for their effort: the last few weeks haven&#8217;t been easy but we knew we would get back. We keep fighting, together with our partners Ferrari, that have helped us to today&#8217;s result. We had reasonable pace throughout the weekend and we confirmed that the good things we showed in practice were not a fluke. We saw that our race pace is better than our qualifying pace, which is something we will address as a priority as we aim for another step forward ahead of Montreal. There&#8217;s no time to sit down now, there&#8217;s work to be done every day both trackside and in Hinwil, and we have full confidence in our ability to deliver.&#8220;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Zhou Guanyu of China driving the (24) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari makes a\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Valtteri Bottas of Finland and Alfa Romeo F1 looks on prior to the F1\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Zhou Guanyu of China driving the (24) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari makes a pitstop during the F1 Grand Prix of Spain at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on June 04, 2023 in Barcelona, Spain.

He stopped quite early on, using the undercut to his advantage both times and was holding on to ninth late on. But when Zhou tried a move around the outside into Turn 1, Tsunoda ran him wide and off the track in a move the stewards deemed unacceptable. That earned him a five-second time penalty, which dropped him from ninth at the flag down to P12. De Vries had a quieter race, and couldn&#8217;t quite keep up with his rapid team mate today.</p>\n<p><strong>Nyck de Vries, 14th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Obviously, as a team, we wanted more. Although I had a good start, I was in the wrong place at the wrong time and got stuck on the inside, so we lost too many places and then got stuck behind other cars. We tried to undercut, but I was struggling to get past, which cost me a lot of time. Certain moments of the race were good and the last 25 laps on the medium compound were very competitive, so I think we just need to try and put it together better. This weekend has been competitive from the start, so I definitely think we are making progress with the car. Canada will be a different type of track, but I'm confident we can build on our improvements and capitalise on every opportunity.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Yuki Tsunoda, 12th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I am super disappointed and frustrated. I think the penalty I was given for forcing another driver off the track was very harsh but it&#8217;s something I have to accept. There was little space but still I thought it was enough. On a positive side, the team did a fantastic job to improve the brake issues we&#8217;ve been having, and to put me in the fight for points the last two race weekends. It shows that the car is improving and the hard work is paying off. The weekend is done now, and I am looking ahead to the next race in Canada.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Guillaume Dezoteux, Head Of Vehicle Performance</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Until the very last moments on the grid, we monitored the weather closely as it was raining a few kilometres away. Surprisingly, it never arrived and we ended with a two-stop race, close to our predictions.</p>\n<p>Yuki drove fantastically. He was able to stay with Ocon for most of the race, which is encouraging regarding our race pace. Unfortunately, while defending Zhou in Turn 1, he didn't leave enough space at the apex and received a five-second penalty for this, ending up P12.</p>\n<p>Nyck had a strong start, although he lost a couple of positions in the opening laps and ended up in a train of cars for most of the first and second stints. Nyck's third stint on the medium tyre looked strong and he was able to close on Piastri towards the end of the race finishing P14.</p>\n<p>This weekend feels a bit like a missed opportunity, as we believe we had a package strong enough for points and being closer to the midfield in qualifying. Nevertheless, we have learned a lot about our car in a wide range of conditions, and this will give us valuable data for the developments coming in the future.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Zhou Guanyu of China driving the (24) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari and\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Nyck de Vries of Netherlands driving the (21) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Zhou Guanyu of China driving the (24) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari and Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04 battle for position during the F1 Grand Prix of Spain at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on June 04, 2023 in Barcelona, Spain.

Emerging last, it was a tough ask from there for Norris to be involved in much action. As for Piastri, he lost out to Russell off the line and was running close to the points in the early stages. But the McLaren was harder on its tyres than some others, and the Australian started to fall backwards late on.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.norris-rues-unlucky-first-lap-collision-with-hamilton-but-says-spanish-gp.cgtPtQIMCsw6ntFopyz21.html\">READ MORE: Norris rues 'unlucky' first lap collision with Hamilton but says Spanish GP went 'as expected' after lowly P17 finish</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Lando Norris, 17th</strong></p>\n<p>\"Today we had a difficult afternoon. We just didn&#8217;t have the pace, compared to what we had yesterday, which is more or less what we expected, so it was difficult for us. At the start I didn&#8217;t see the Red Bull go off track, misjudged how much the cars in front were going to check up and I just clipped the front wing. It was the smallest of touches, but it cost us a lot, although I don&#8217;t think we would have finished in the points anyway. It was a difficult day for us as a team, but we&#8217;ll keep working hard to try to improve.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Oscar Piastri, 13th</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was a disappointing afternoon. Our pace in quali didn&#8217;t translate to the race, so it was tough. But it&#8217;s important we focus on taking the positives from Saturday&#8217;s quali result where our one-lap pace looked very strong. We now just need to work on the race pace as we head to Canada in two weeks&#8217; time.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Andrea Stella, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>\"Following a very positive qualifying session, today&#8217;s Spanish Grand Prix was a more realistic showing of our current competitiveness. We knew it would be more difficult to perform at the top of the field on race pace today given the hotter conditions. The situation was compounded by contact on the first lap between Lando and Lewis Hamilton, which resulted in Lando pitting for a new front wing and falling 30 seconds behind the field.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I would like to praise the team today. Despite a difficult position, both Lando and Oscar both kept pushing, their engineering teams put in maximum effort to extract everything from the cars, and the garage crew delivered good pit-stops. Back at the factory, everyone is working hard to deliver upgrades and looking to the future when we hope to be fighting for more competitive positions.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Oscar Piastri of Australia driving the (81) McLaren MCL60 Mercedes on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Lando Norris of Great Britain driving the (4) McLaren MCL60 Mercedes in\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Oscar Piastri of Australia driving the (81) McLaren MCL60 Mercedes on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Spain at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on June 04, 2023 in Barcelona, Spain.

The German lost out at the start, and could not get his tyres switched on. He was forced into an early stop, as was his team mate, only for the American team start to struggle with their rear jack. Slow stops all round for both drivers and more tyre woes saw them come home down the order.</p>\n<p><strong>Nico Hulkenberg, 15th</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was tough. Unfortunately, the degradation was really high for us and we had to three-stop whereas the competition didn&#8217;t. It looks at first glance that over one lap we&#8217;re competitive but in the long runs we still have some homework to do and some pace to find.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Magnussen, 18th</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was a tough day in terms of tyre management. At the beginning of every stint, it was quite competitive compared to everyone we were fighting, but our tyres just fell off quickly and we had to three-stop which wasn&#8217;t optimal. Hopefully we can try and learn about what caused it to improve, but certainly it was a tough race. When you have a bad weekend like this, you tend to find some interesting answers and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m hoping for now &#8211; onto the next one.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Guenther Steiner, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>\"Quite a disappointing result today, we just couldn&#8217;t get the tyres to stay alive. We did one more pit stop than everyone else, but even if we hadn&#8217;t stopped, we would&#8217;ve gone slower and ended up there anyway. We need to go back to the drawing board and try to find a solution to our tyre degradation.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Nico Hulkenberg of Germany driving the (27) Haas F1 VF-23 Ferrari leads\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Kevin Magnussen of Denmark driving the (20) Haas F1 VF-23 Ferrari on a\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Nico Hulkenberg of Germany driving the (27) Haas F1 VF-23 Ferrari leads Zhou Guanyu of China driving the (24) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Spain at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on June 04, 2023 in Barcelona, Spain.

They had lacked pace all weekend, and in race trim it was more of the same. Sargeant had started from the pit lane after the team modified his car overnight, but couldn&#8217;t make any headway from there while Albon also failed to get involved. Other circuits should suit their car more.</p>\n<p><strong>Logan Sargeant, 20th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Starting from pit lane didn&#8217;t cost us too much as we caught the back of the pack pretty quickly. The first two stints were pretty good which was positive, but that last stint was tricky. We need to understand why it changed from stint to stint as I couldn&#8217;t find the pace or grip. We&#8217;ll get rested up and ready for Canada in a couple of weeks.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Alex Albon, 16th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;The race wasn&#8217;t easy, but it was better than I thought it would be. We were fighting and beat three cars on merit. Considering where we were on Friday and Saturday, I&#8217;m pleasantly surprised with how today went. You get no prizes for P16 but if there was some rain we could&#8217;ve maybe had something.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This weekend showed that, unfortunately, when it comes to these proper race tracks like Barcelona we do struggle and lack a bit of downforce. We&#8217;ve got some upgrades coming soon and hopefully once we get that increase in performance we can fight more in the midfield like the start of the year. Until then it&#8217;s about maximising the car we&#8217;ve got. Hopefully, we can do a bit better when we get to Canada.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Charles Leclerc of Monaco driving the (16) Ferrari SF-23 leads Logan\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan and Scuderia AlphaTauri, Alexander Albon of\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Charles Leclerc of Monaco driving the (16) Ferrari SF-23 leads Logan Sargeant of United States driving the (2) Williams FW45 Mercedes on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Spain at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on June 04, 2023 in Barcelona, Spain.

The C1 covered 41.6% of the laps completed, then came the C2 (30.6%) and the C3 (27.9%). The decision to introduce the new for 2023 C1 specification compound meant that a two-stop strategy was on the cards and was used by most of the teams. Compared with our pre-race predictions we saw that the Medium was more competitive, partly down to the track temperature being significantly lower than during last year&#8217;s race. Initial analysis suggests that degradation on all the compounds was lower, even with the softest C3. Notable examples of this were the first stints for the two Mercedes drivers with Russell doing 25 laps and Hamilton 24, or Alonso&#8217;s middle stint (25 laps) running a heavy fuel load and yet running at a pretty competitive pace.</p>\n<p>\"It&#8217;s been a very busy weekend for Pirelli. Apart from F1 here in Barcelona, we were also working at all three car racing series in which we are the sole tyre supplier &#8211; in Sardinia with the WRC and in France at Paul Ricard with the GT World Challenge Europe. Additionally, there was our two-wheeled commitment and in Misano (Italy) we celebrated Pirelli&#8217;s 20th anniversary as sole tyre supplier in the SBK Championship. Pirelli is staying in Barcelona with two days of very important testing this coming week aimed at next season. The programme is focused on the development of compounds that can be used without the usual pre-heating procedures.\"</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.highlights-watch-the-action-from-the-spanish-grand-prix-as-verstappen.3VIlNJOC8yFOlQnkaJnaiP.html\">HIGHLIGHTS: Watch the action from the Spanish Grand Prix as Verstappen dominates to take victory</a></strong></p>\n\n    </div>",

It\u2019s a massive pleasure to drive a car like this. It was important to try and keep the lead into turn one, it was quite tight. From there onwards it was about managing the tyres, I was able to create a big gap. We went on to the hards but I didn\u2019t seem to have much grip, I was sliding around quite a lot, the pace was okay but I couldn\u2019t create more of a gap, so we switched to softs and then I just needed to bring it home. We\u2019ve had another strong weekend and that\u2019s of course what I like to see for the Team, hopefully we can keep this up throughout the year.\u201d Sergio Perez, 4th \"I am disappointed with today, we have ultimately paid the price for a bad qualifying. We did have a good strategy but, looking at where we started from, there was only so much that we could do. I think P3 was possible but, if we wanted more points, then I would have had to take more risks on lap one and potentially compromise my race. George went really deep on that first lap, gaining a lot of positions but we took it easier to ensure we had more of a clean start. Then we got stuck behind the Aston Martin and Fernando was quite hard to pass, so it meant I couldn\u2019t progress through the field as quickly as we would have liked. This weekend, in general, has been a step back and we weren\u2019t quite there, but there are plenty of things we can do better. All in all, we brought home twelve points today and I think, looking forward, Canada should be a strong race for us. Everything is pretty close right now so that will be an interesting one.\u201d Christian Horner, Team Principal \u201cAnother great performance from Max. The start was strong, he had to be firm but fair with Carlos into the first turn and from there he managed the race really well. We ran all three compounds today and he had the pace to cover whatever was going on behind him finishing with a 24 second gap by the end of the race. Max was totally in control. But it\u2019s not just Max, the whole Team is operating at an elite level. We have a phenomenal car, we have two great drivers and we are continuing to evolve and become more polished. It was a good recovery from Checo, especially the second part of the race and I think that will give him a lot more confidence. He had a difficult Monaco, a difficult qualifying but a better Sunday. Looking at the gap between the two drivers, the pressure is off now and we know what Checo is capable of. I\u2019m sure he will re-find that form from the early races in the near future.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Race winner Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle Red Bull Racing celebrates in parc ferme during the F1 Grand Prix of Spain at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on June 04, 2023 in Barcelona, Spain.

Luckily that didn\u2019t damage his W14, as he had some serious pace out there. He was able to run the softs longer than Sainz, which got him ahead of the Ferrari after the first stops, and from there had a lonely race in second. Russell started much further back but was electric off the line, picking up a handful of places despite taking to the escape road through the first few corners.

I didn\u2019t expect us to come here this weekend and finish second. I was able to keep everything under control today. We couldn\u2019t keep up with the Red Bull of Max (Verstappen) as they are in another league, but this is still a really positive result. For George to come through from P12 to P3 is also spectacular. I feel incredibly grateful to the whole Team, everyone back at the factory to Team LH all over the world who are always sticking by me. \"We are learning more and more about the car. I am hoping that the car continues to be like it was this weekend. I am hoping from here onwards we are in a good place. For sure, there will be some circuits where the car isn\u2019t quite in the right window but hopefully the next few races should suit us.\" George Russell, 3rd \"It was a pretty good race today! This morning, I had a lot of confidence that I could move forward from P12 and thought that P5 or P6 was achievable. After a good start, our pace was just there from the very beginning. We knew after Friday that we had good race pace, but you can never be 100 per cent sure if it will translate to the Grand Prix. I was really pleased it did, I was able to make some good overtakes and bring it home on the podium. \"This result highlights all the hard work and efforts that have gone on at the factory to bring these upgrades. We had a strong race here last year, so the next couple of races will be key to see if we can consistently produce results like this and close the gap to Red Bull.\" Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport \"I\u2019m really pleased with the hard work that has been done in Brackley and Brixworth, and happy for everyone in the Team. It\u2019s a good result but we need to be realistic too. The lower temperatures today and on Saturday really suited us; it was nice and fresh, not too hot nor too cold, and the car was in a mega window. \"We took a decision to go in another direction early in the season; it was a risky move, but everyone has just pushed forward and we\u2019ve got a good race car. We now need to just keep chipping away. We are a good Team at grinding away; once there is a clear direction we just go for it. Let\u2019s keep our expectations real though. We\u2019ve got a long way to go to catch Red Bull but it\u2019s good to see we are moving in the right direction.\" Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director \"It\u2019s great to see both cars on the podium again. It\u2019s been a while! We\u2019re obviously pleased with the result but it\u2019s more satisfying to see the progress with the car. The Team have been working flat out since the Bahrain test to bring improvements to the car, and it\u2019s nice to see that the recent updates appear to have brought performance. \"The drivers did a great job balancing the need to push to overtake today with the tyre management requirements. The Team also did really well optimising the race. For sure this track suits the car, especially on the long run, so we\u2019re realistic about our chances in Montreal. We seem to be moving in the right direction though and that\u2019s the main thing. We\u2019ve made good progress in the championship; Max is clearly out of arms reach for us at the moment, but we had fun today and we\u2019re looking forward to the next races.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 3 BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Second placed Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain and Mercedes celebrates on the podium during the F1 Grand Prix of Spain at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on June 04, 2023 in Barcelona, Spain.

From there Sainz had to look behind rather than in front, and didn\u2019t have the pace on any compound to keep the Mercedes cars at bay today. As for Leclerc, he gambled on the hards from the pit lane but couldn\u2019t make inroads in the early stages. That Ferrari only really came to life on the softs late on, with the Monegasque driver able to climb up to 11th, running out of time to pick off Gasly ahead.

We ran the Hards twice, but with the first set I struggled a lot, while with the second one it was reasonably good and I was catching Pierre (Gasly) towards the end. \"We really must analyse all the data, because while the upgrades seem to work as expected, we are always slightly caught out by what is happening with the tyres and we struggle to get them in the right window which is a big problem. We ran the same tyre twice in the same race and we went from having a very bad car to quite a good one towards the end of the race. Now we will go back to the factory and find out what went wrong yesterday in qualifying because that\u2019s what put us in a tricky situation today. There\u2019s a lot of work to do.\" Carlos Sainz, 5th \"It was a tough race. Unfortunately, we couldn\u2019t fight at the front as our pace is pretty much dictated by tyre management and degradation. I know Sundays have been frustrating so far this season, but we gave it our all on track this weekend and we will keep working on this new package and on developing our car. \"Thank you to everyone out there in the grandstands cheering for us every day! It\u2019s always a pleasure to race at home.\" Fred Vasseur, Team Principal \"We made a step forward this weekend in terms of our qualifying pace, with Carlos on the front row after the best Saturday of his season so far. However it is clear that, in terms of race pace, Red Bull and Mercedes are quicker than us. As for the upgrades, I think we have made a step forward overall if you compare this weekend with Miami. Clearly, we know it is still not enough. Our problem is not our outright performance, it is our lack of consistency. Charles\u2019 first set of Hards was a sort of a nightmare but then on his last set of the same compound he was happy with the balance: we must assess this inconsistency. Now we will focus completely on this issue before Canada. For sure we will continue to develop the car but this is a matter of improving by tenths of a second, whereas in the race we are looking for seconds at the moment. There is something in the car that we must unlock if we want to move forward.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 3 BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: fifth placed Carlos Sainz of Spain and Ferrari walks in parc ferme during the F1 Grand Prix of Spain at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on June 04, 2023 in Barcelona, Spain.

Stroll started and finished sixth, and had Alonso on his tail in the closing stages. The Spaniard had had to work hard, twice pitting into traffic and having to work his way back past the likes of Ocon and Zhou, but despite closing in on his team mate Alonso opted to just bring the car home and make sure the team picked up as many points as they could. Fernando Alonso, 7th \"We didn\u2019t have as much pace today on both the Soft and Hard compounds, so it was a tricky race for us. We tried to go longer on our strategy and hoped it would pay off later with fresher tyres, but our rivals had a little more pace. I think sixth and seventh positions were the maximum for us. I thought our performance seemed better in qualifying, so I think we need to look at why and aim to bounce back for Canada. We still scored some solid points and we had no risk at the end of the race. I want to thank the fans for their passion, energy and support this weekend. It was very emotional and special for me.\u201d Lance Stroll, 6th \u201cIt was a fun battle with Lewis [Hamilton] on the first lap; I\u2019ve pulled that move off before so I knew there was a gap and figured Lewis would leave me a bit of space, which he did. That put me in a good position going into Turn Five and I could hold the place. Then, from about five laps in, we really struggled with the pace. My tyre degradation was higher than expected but the cars around us didn\u2019t seem to have the same issue, so it\u2019s something we\u2019ll look to understand for the coming races. We bring home some good points finishing sixth and seventh, but I think we\u2019d been hoping for slightly more today. I\u2019m looking forward to heading to Canada, my home race, in a few days\u2019 time.\u201d Mike Krack, Team Principal \u201cIt was good to have both Aston Martins finish well this afternoon and we come away from Barcelona with 14 points. Lance and Fernando pushed hard all afternoon, made some important overtakes, and showed great teamwork. We should not be disappointed with this result \u2013 even though we did not quite have the pace to fight for the podium today. It was in the first stint on the Softs that we did not quite have the performance to catch the cars ahead and in the second and third stints we managed our pace and had a comfortable advantage over the teams behind us. Before we leave Spain, I want to say a big thank you to the passionate fans: their energy has been very motivating throughout this race week, and we have really enjoyed racing here.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 3 BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Carlos Sainz of Spain and Ferrari and Fernando Alonso of Spain and Aston Martin F1 Team interact on the grid prior to the F1 Grand Prix of Spain at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on June 04, 2023 in Barcelona, Spain.

But an early pit stop for fresh rubber galvanised him and at times he was the quickest man out there. He climbed back through the field to finish 11th, inheriting P10 thanks to Tsunoda\u2019s time penalty. As for Ocon, he didn\u2019t have the pace to keep Russell and Perez at bay, nor Alonso. He did make his former team mate work hard for the place though, pushing him as wide as he dared on the main straight. Esteban Ocon, 8th \u201cWe leave Barcelona with double points again so I think we can be satisfied with our work this weekend. We finished eighth in the end and I don\u2019t think there was much more we could have done today, with our race pace perhaps lacking a bit compared to our competitors who finished in front. We\u2019ll definitely take a look to see how we can improve that but, overall, it was a strong Saturday and a decent Sunday for us. We can be proud of the last couple of weeks but we know there is work to do to keep heading in the right direction.\u201d Pierre Gasly, 10th Another double points finish but we always strive for more. On my side, it\u2019s frustrating after such a strong qualifying yesterday and also the fact we showed good race pace today capable of fighting in the top six. Unfortunately, the penalties and the poor start had a big impact on my race, and we\u2019ll collectively review to see what we can improve for next time. The car is performing well \u2013 that\u2019s three points scoring finishes in a row \u2013 and we must keep striving for more. I\u2019m looking forward to a bit of time off before taking on Canada in two weeks.\u201d Otmar Szafnauer, Team Principal \u201cWe come away from the Spanish Grand Prix with five points after Esteban finished eighth and Pierre tenth. It was a tough race with varying strategies and gameplans. For Esteban he did a good job to be in the mix for the top six, just missing out in the end and there are certainly a couple of aspects from his race to be improved for next time. Pierre already lost six places due to the grid penalty after a superb qualifying yesterday where he was fourth and then lost another four positions on lap one after being caught on the wrong side of a scrum of cars in the opening turns. He did a great job to recover those places in the end to score a point. Of course, we are aiming for more than minor points \u2013 like last week in Monaco \u2013 but the performance of the car is solid and we\u2019re taking the fight to those ahead. There are some things we must improve \u2013 small details to get right \u2013 and we look forward to racing in Canada later this month ready to keep battling for those higher positions.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Esteban Ocon of France driving the (31) Alpine F1 A523 Renault leads Nico Hulkenberg of Germany driving the (27) Haas F1 VF-23 Ferrari and Zhou Guanyu of China driving the (24) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Spain at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on June 04, 2023 in Barcelona, Spain.

The Finn lacked pace all the way through the race and came home a lowly 19th. But his team mate had a great race \u2013 a brilliant start jumped him forward, and from there Zhou did have the pace, overtaking Hulkenberg twice and making a move on Tsunoda. The AlphaTauri man ran him wide and off the track, picking up a penalty and so Zhou inherited ninth at the flag. Valtteri Bottas, 19th \u201cFirst of all, congratulations to Zhou and the team for getting points; he showed good pace, and that\u2019s encouraging for the next races, as proof of the hard work put in by the team back home in Hinwil and here at the track. From my side, we found damage to the floor, probably from some debris picked up at the start of the race, and that cost us quite a big chunk of performance: as a result, I just lacked pace altogether today, I wasn\u2019t able to put up a fight with anybody and it was quite a long race for me. I know we can put this race behind us and quickly come back on the right track before heading to Montreal in two weeks. The circuit will be once again completely different, and hopefully it\u2019ll suit our car. We had a decent race in Montreal last year, scoring a very good result for the team: hopefully, we\u2019ll be able to replicate that, and keep this streak running.\u201d Zhou Guanyu, 9th \u201cI really enjoyed today, it was a well-executed race from my side: I think these have been some of the best two days for me in Formula One, in terms of performance. I had a good first lap, and that was crucial to give us the opportunity to get something out of this race: our pace was strong, although there were times in which we had to manage our tyres wisely. I knew I had to keep the pressure on the others to bring home a result and, when the opportunity was there, I tried to force them to make a mistake. At the end, I knew I had the pace to take Yuki [Tsunoda]: I had DRS, I was half a car ahead going into the corner, but I wasn\u2019t given any space and didn\u2019t have any other choice than to take the escape route to avoid contact. In the end, things worked out well and we were able to bring home two points, which was a good result.\u201d Alessandro Alunni Bravi, Team Representative \u201cToday, we showed that we\u2019re ready to fight for every single lap, every single tenth of a second on track. We have shown that, working together with determination and as a team, we can deliver the result we all, and our drivers, deserve. The field is very close, we saw that today: every thousandth of a second matters so we need to be aggressive, have a results-driven mentality. We had a hard fight on track with the Haas, the Alpines, the AlphaTauris and to come out of this with points is a very positive result. \"Zhou drove very well, pushing every lap and working with the team on how to improve his performance. He is making good progress: especially after a tough weekend in Monaco, he showed the ability to bounce back with confidence and the points he scored are a good reward. Valtteri suffered a difficult Saturday, and today he suffered damage to his car that dashed any hope of a comeback. He will get back stronger in Montreal. \"We had a strong race as a team, with the right strategy calls from the pit-wall and good execution. The team worked really hard and we\u2019re grateful for their effort: the last few weeks haven\u2019t been easy but we knew we would get back. We keep fighting, together with our partners Ferrari, that have helped us to today\u2019s result. We had reasonable pace throughout the weekend and we confirmed that the good things we showed in practice were not a fluke. We saw that our race pace is better than our qualifying pace, which is something we will address as a priority as we aim for another step forward ahead of Montreal. There\u2019s no time to sit down now, there\u2019s work to be done every day both trackside and in Hinwil, and we have full confidence in our ability to deliver.\u201c\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Zhou Guanyu of China driving the (24) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari makes a pitstop during the F1 Grand Prix of Spain at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on June 04, 2023 in Barcelona, Spain.

He stopped quite early on, using the undercut to his advantage both times and was holding on to ninth late on. But when Zhou tried a move around the outside into Turn 1, Tsunoda ran him wide and off the track in a move the stewards deemed unacceptable. That earned him a five-second time penalty, which dropped him from ninth at the flag down to P12. De Vries had a quieter race, and couldn\u2019t quite keep up with his rapid team mate today. Nyck de Vries, 14th \u201cObviously, as a team, we wanted more. Although I had a good start, I was in the wrong place at the wrong time and got stuck on the inside, so we lost too many places and then got stuck behind other cars. We tried to undercut, but I was struggling to get past, which cost me a lot of time. Certain moments of the race were good and the last 25 laps on the medium compound were very competitive, so I think we just need to try and put it together better. This weekend has been competitive from the start, so I definitely think we are making progress with the car. Canada will be a different type of track, but I'm confident we can build on our improvements and capitalise on every opportunity.\u201d Yuki Tsunoda, 12th \u201cI am super disappointed and frustrated. I think the penalty I was given for forcing another driver off the track was very harsh but it\u2019s something I have to accept. There was little space but still I thought it was enough. On a positive side, the team did a fantastic job to improve the brake issues we\u2019ve been having, and to put me in the fight for points the last two race weekends. It shows that the car is improving and the hard work is paying off. The weekend is done now, and I am looking ahead to the next race in Canada.\u201d Guillaume Dezoteux, Head Of Vehicle Performance \u201cUntil the very last moments on the grid, we monitored the weather closely as it was raining a few kilometres away. Surprisingly, it never arrived and we ended with a two-stop race, close to our predictions. Yuki drove fantastically. He was able to stay with Ocon for most of the race, which is encouraging regarding our race pace. Unfortunately, while defending Zhou in Turn 1, he didn't leave enough space at the apex and received a five-second penalty for this, ending up P12. Nyck had a strong start, although he lost a couple of positions in the opening laps and ended up in a train of cars for most of the first and second stints. Nyck's third stint on the medium tyre looked strong and he was able to close on Piastri towards the end of the race finishing P14. This weekend feels a bit like a missed opportunity, as we believe we had a package strong enough for points and being closer to the midfield in qualifying. Nevertheless, we have learned a lot about our car in a wide range of conditions, and this will give us valuable data for the developments coming in the future.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BARCELONA, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Zhou Guanyu of China driving the (24) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari and Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04 battle for position during the F1 Grand Prix of Spain at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on June 04, 2023 in Barcelona, Spain.

At the start I didn\u2019t see the Red Bull go off track, misjudged how much the cars in front were going to check up and I just clipped the front wing. It was the smallest of touches, but it cost us a lot, although I don\u2019t think we would have finished in the points anyway. It was a difficult day for us as a team, but we\u2019ll keep working hard to try to improve.\" Oscar Piastri, 13th \"It was a disappointing afternoon. Our pace in quali didn\u2019t translate to the race, so it was tough. But it\u2019s important we focus on taking the positives from Saturday\u2019s quali result where our one-lap pace looked very strong.

We knew it would be more difficult to perform at the top of the field on race pace today given the hotter conditions. The situation was compounded by contact on the first lap between Lando and Lewis Hamilton, which resulted in Lando pitting for a new front wing and falling 30 seconds behind the field. \u201cI would like to praise the team today. Despite a difficult position, both Lando and Oscar both kept pushing, their engineering teams put in maximum effort to extract everything from the cars, and the garage crew delivered good pit-stops.

Slow stops all round for both drivers and more tyre woes saw them come home down the order. Nico Hulkenberg, 15th \"It was tough. Unfortunately, the degradation was really high for us and we had to three-stop whereas the competition didn\u2019t. It looks at first glance that over one lap we\u2019re competitive but in the long runs we still have some homework to do and some pace to find.\" Kevin Magnussen, 18th \"It was a tough day in terms of tyre management. At the beginning of every stint, it was quite competitive compared to everyone we were fighting, but our tyres just fell off quickly and we had to three-stop which wasn\u2019t optimal. Hopefully we can try and learn about what caused it to improve, but certainly it was a tough race. When you have a bad weekend like this, you tend to find some interesting answers and that\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping for now \u2013 onto the next one.\" Guenther Steiner, Team Principal \"Quite a disappointing result today, we just couldn\u2019t get the tyres to stay alive.

Other circuits should suit their car more. Logan Sargeant, 20th \u201cStarting from pit lane didn\u2019t cost us too much as we caught the back of the pack pretty quickly. The first two stints were pretty good which was positive, but that last stint was tricky. We need to understand why it changed from stint to stint as I couldn\u2019t find the pace or grip. We\u2019ll get rested up and ready for Canada in a couple of weeks.\u201d Alex Albon, 16th \u201cThe race wasn\u2019t easy, but it was better than I thought it would be.

            "article_html": "<div><h3>Red Bull</h3>\n<p>Red Bull looked to be struggling slightly in final practice, with both drivers unhappy with their car balance. But once the sun set, the Bulls came to the fore. They looked to be in an incredibly tight battle in qualifying with Ferrari, Aston Martin and Mercedes. But when it mattered, Verstappen put in a scintillating lap to grab the opening pole of the season, with Perez ensuring a front row lock out for the team.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.verstappen-explains-why-hes-particularly-happy-with-bahrain-pole-after.4ammV6OLRPd0RNx1hPVyTB.html\">READ MORE: Verstappen explains why he&#8217;s &#8216;particularly happy&#8217; with Bahrain pole after &#8216;unusual&#8217; approach by Red Bull</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Max Verstappen, 1st, 1:29.708</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very happy to be on pole, it hasn&#8217;t been the easiest weekend so far as we&#8217;ve been struggling to find the right balance and I&#8217;ve been trying to find my rhythm. Overall, it was quite a good qualifying, we recovered well with the performance. It&#8217;s great for the whole Team to have a one-two start tomorrow, and to have Checo up there as well is really promising. A lot of things can happen during a race as we all know, but I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing what we can do out there on track as a Team.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Sergio Perez, 2nd, 1:29.846</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;When you miss pole position by a tenth of a second you always think there is a bit more you could have given, that is only a braking zone or something. It was really close out there today, look at the competition from Q2 and Q3, if you didn&#8217;t get a perfect lap then you were P5. We made some compromises in qualifying for tomorrow&#8217;s race and hopefully that will pay off so we can have a very strong race car. I am more comfortable with the car; the rear end of this car is a bit more planted, so I am able to work with it a little better so that&#8217;s a positive for me. I think Ferrari will be in the mix for the race, along with Aston Martin and Mercedes. We hadn&#8217;t seen this kind of pace from Ferrari until today, so I think they have been hiding quite a bit. If Charles was to do his final run, he would have been in with a shot for pole position. I think managing the tyre degradation will be crucial tomorrow and it will be really important for us to concentrate on our own race.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Christian Horner, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Great start to the season in what turned out to be a very close qualifying. Both drivers managed to navigate their way into Q3 with the two sets of the softer tyres available. To lock out the front row is the best possible start for tomorrow&#8217;s race, but, the points are on Sunday, and as we know from last year, it&#8217;s important to finish. As I say though, it&#8217;s a great start from the drivers and the Team, but plenty of work still to do as we look to convert these excellent grid positions into points tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Pole position qualifier Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle Red Bull Racing prepares\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Sergio Perez of Mexico driving the (11) Oracle Red Bull Racing RB19 on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">3</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Pole position qualifier Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle Red Bull Racing and Second placed qualifier Sergio Perez of Mexico and Oracle Red Bull Racing talk in parc ferme during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

It looked like Ferrari were right in the fight, despite some early dramas as Leclerc lost a couple of pieces of bodywork after locking up on his initial lap at the start of qualifying. But the team opted not to send Leclerc out for a second push lap in Q3, opting instead to save a fresh set of softs for the race itself. Sainz did go out for a second run after a small mistake on his opening effort and improved to ensure Ferrari have two cars on the second row.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.it-would-have-been-close-leclerc-explains-q3-tactics-as-he-trades-pole-shot.hpvSg7awIpDrf8JXtXuSL.html\">READ MORE: &#8216;It would have been close&#8217; &#8211; Leclerc explains Q3 tactics as he trades pole shot for improved race strategy</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Charles Leclerc, 3rd, 1:30.000</strong></p>\n<p>\"A positive qualifying. We were in the fight for pole, which we didn't expect coming into the weekend. Several teams seem to be quite close, which makes things more exciting for drivers and fans, and I think it's good for the sport.\nIn terms of race pace, we could find ourselves a bit on the backfoot, as our competitors looked very strong in that area during free practice. We will give everything tomorrow and, with an extra set of fresh Soft tyres, hopefully we will have a good fight.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Carlos Sainz, 4th, 1:30.154</strong></p>\n<p>\"Today we made a step forward as a team. It&#8217;s been a difficult build-up to qualifying for me, not having had a clean day yesterday, but we reacted well today. I lost a bit in sector 2 in a couple of twitchy corners, but apart from that the feeling overall was better.</p>\n<p>\"Now we&#8217;re looking forward to tomorrow. We&#8217;ll fight until the very last lap and try to bring home a good result to get the season going.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Fred Vasseur, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>\"It&#8217;s always difficult to have a clear picture going into the very first qualifying of the season, as you come here not knowing where the others are, but in the end we got a good result today. We were P1 in both Q1 and Q2 so it was looking good for the fight for pole, but then we decided with Charles to save one set of new tyres for tomorrow&#8217;s race, whereas with Carlos we used another new set since it was such a tight qualifying and a new tyre made the difference. Starting from the second row is actually a positive result considering that we will have the only driver with an extra set of new Soft tyres, so I am more than happy with this first qualifying. For tomorrow, when the points are scored, we need to put everything together and manage degradation. We have carried out some good race simulations, it&#8217;s a long season and tomorrow&#8217;s race is just the first step.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Carlos Sainz of Spain driving the (55) Ferrari SF-23 on track during\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Third placed qualifier Charles Leclerc of Monaco and Ferrari looks on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Carlos Sainz of Spain driving the (55) Ferrari SF-23 on track during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

He was right in the mix throughout qualifying, but with only one set of tyres in Q3, ultimately had to settle for fifth. Stroll wasn&#8217;t too far back in eighth, the Canadian putting in a stellar effort considering he confirmed that he broke his toe along with his wrist in that biking accident.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.an-unbelievable-result-and-car-alonso-hails-aston-martin-performance-after.6tZ5SCDAzk81qTvcG8kjLx.html\">READ MORE: 'An unbelievable result and car' &#8211; Alonso hails Aston Martin performance after qualifying fifth in Bahrain</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Fernando Alonso, 5th, 1:30.336</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;The whole weekend has been very good for us so far and we are very happy to be starting inside the top five for the first race tomorrow. Last year the team found itself out of Q1 and now we are lining up fifth on the grid. Everyone in the team has done an amazing job and this is a strong baseline to build upon as we start the season. We shall see what tomorrow brings, but we have been competitive in all the sessions and we are starting close to the podium positions. If there is an opportunity there for the taking, then we will look to capitalise on it.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Lance Stroll, 8th, 1:30.836</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I am really happy with today&#8217;s result. It shows the progress we have made as a team over the winter and that our hard work is paying off. From eighth we can race well and hopefully bring home some points tomorrow. I have spent the practice sessions doing my best to learn about the car, get up to speed, and find a rhythm as we built up to qualifying. I am really pleased with the performance I put in today and feeling grateful to be here just two weeks after my accident. I cannot wait to go racing tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Mike Krack, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;To get both cars through to Q3 in fifth and eighth is an excellent outcome from the first qualifying session of the year. I must say a big well done to the whole team &#8211; back at base and here at the track &#8211; for their constant hard work to get us to this point. The goal has been to take a step forward and our performance across today indicates we have done just that. We can race well from those grid positions and target scoring points with both cars. Huge credit to Lance for his performance today, especially given his situation, and having missed all of winter testing. His determination to get back in the car has been very impressive and he has done a super job to qualify in eighth. Fernando, too, delivered a strong performance tonight, with clean and tidy laps to take fifth, building on the speed we have shown during practice. Tomorrow is what really counts, though, and we will work hard to convert these positions into points.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: 5th placed qualifier Fernando Alonso of Spain and Aston Martin F1 Team\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Lance Stroll of Canada driving the (18) Aston Martin AMR23 Mercedes on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: 5th placed qualifier Fernando Alonso of Spain and Aston Martin F1 Team looks on in parc ferme during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

But in Q3, when the others began to turn their engines up, Mercedes fell back somewhat. Given they only had one run each and had to go out midway through before the track had fully ramped up, it certainly isn&#8217;t all doom and gloom for the Silver Arrows, but both drivers will have their work cut out to move forward in what looks an incredibly tight front pack.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.russell-targeting-bahrain-gp-podium-fight-as-mercedes-drivers-prepare-to.17EyVoyiYQs4cbjF6SHxyU.html\">READ MORE: Russell targeting Bahrain GP podium fight as Mercedes drivers prepare to take on &#8216;unknown&#8217; Alonso</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Lewis Hamilton, 7th, 1:30.384</strong></p>\n<p>\"I thought today may be worse than it ended up being. We did some great work overnight and the car felt much better in FP3. Overall, Qualifying was OK. I thought we might struggle to get into Q3 yesterday, but we didn't. We were in a fight. We don't know if we have the same race pace that we showed last year but I'm hoping we can be in the fight amongst the group behind Red Bull. It's really all going to depend on what our long-run pace is like. I am genuinely happy for Aston Martin. It's amazing to see their progress and the steps that they have taken. I am happy for Fernando as he's been here way longer than me so it's good to have him back in the mix! I'm sure we will have some good races.\"</p>\n<p><strong>George Russell, 6th, 1:30.340</strong></p>\n<p>\"Today was a lot better than we expected, particularly after yesterday. We had a tough Friday; we expected to add a little bit of performance overnight, but we exceeded expectations. The changes we made we thought we might find a tenth, but we found close to five or six tenths, so we need to fully understand why that was. It's positive news but after FP3, we just focused on maximising performance. The car is feeling nice to drive so we are in a much better starting place than we were with the W13. We can now focus on adding global performance rather than problem solving. Tomorrow, we are in a good place to fight for third. Qualifying three tenths behind Ferrari when they have probably been the fastest car on single lap pace is positive. Fernando is probably more of a dark horse than Ferrari.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport</strong></p>\n<p>\"The gap to the very front isn't ridiculous considering we only ran one new soft tyre at the end of Q3. Nevertheless, it's not where we want to be and not what we had aimed for over the winter. We know what the gap is and what we need to find, or more, to win. Neither driver had a clean lap in the final run. There was probably another tenth-and-a-half still in there but it likely wouldn't have changed much. We maybe could have overtaken Alonso with both cars, but this is where we are. We are super critical of ourselves and what we need to achieve. There is no such thing as a sacred cow in our team, and we look at everything. The whole Team thinks like that, so we just need to get our heads together and work out the next steps from here. But first we race tomorrow - and we will be giving it everything we've got to move forward up the field.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director</strong></p>\n<p>\"Clearly, we're disappointed to be so far off pole, but we looked much further off yesterday. It's encouraging that the car responded to the overnight changes, and we've managed to improve a few of the issues like the high-speed cornering. Through the morning session the car was behaving quite predictably given the hotter conditions. There was a bit of fine-tuning going into qualifying and early on, it looked like we were in a pretty good place. As the sessions went on the others seemed to be finding a bit more pace. We also only had one set of tyres for the final part of Qualifying so that added up to leaving us with a gap that's bigger than we'd like but one that we'll be working hard to close down. Our straight-line speed looks strong, and our degradation seems to be in a reasonable place; the Red Bulls are out of reach from what we have seen but it would be good if we can get into a race with the Ferraris and Aston Martins.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: George Russell of Great Britain driving the (63) Mercedes AMG Petronas\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W14 on track during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

He was out anyway having only managed the 17th best time, before the stewards deemed he has exceeded track limits, which dropped him to P20. Ocon though used his experience to scrape into the top 10, one of only two midfield cars to do so. He starts ninth and will be looking to get his points tally up and running at the earliest of opportunities.</p>\n<p><strong>Esteban Ocon, 9th, 1:30.984</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It felt good to be out there and finally really pushing the car to see what it can do and where we stand. Getting through to Q3 is definitely a good way to start the season. We are happy with the progress we have made since the pre-season test, and this is the best the car has felt on track so far this year. Our competitors in front are quick, and we have plenty of work ahead of us, but we&#8217;ve got a car that can get into the points and that will be the goal for the first race of the season.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Pierre Gasly, 20th, 1:32.181</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Clearly, this is not the start to the season we wanted being knocked out in Q1, that said, it means we have everything to gain for tomorrow&#8217;s race and I&#8217;m definitely feeling positive that we can still come away with points from this weekend. Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t quite feel at one with the car today and that meant we were way below where our true level is. There&#8217;s a lot of work ahead of us to continue our understanding of the car and I&#8217;m confident we will come back stronger for our next qualifying session. My focus is on tomorrow and I&#8217;m really looking forward to the race and giving it my all.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Alan Permane, Sporting Director</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Overall, we have mixed feelings after today&#8217;s first Qualifying of the season with Esteban in ninth and Pierre in twentieth. In general, that&#8217;s not where we aim to be, and we certainly have improvements to make to ensure we&#8217;re qualifying in much stronger positions at later races. Pierre is certainly disappointed to be out in Q1. We have a lot to review on his side to understand what happened as clearly the car had much more pace than that. Esteban did a very good job and had three smooth sessions, though, looking at the timesheets, ninth place is probably where we deserve to be today. We&#8217;re definitely ready for tomorrow&#8217;s race as our high fuel running looked good in pre-season testing and in Free Practice 2 yesterday. Pierre can set his sights forward from the back of the grid as this race tends to have plenty of overtaking. For Esteban, he&#8217;s well in contention and there&#8217;s no reason why we cannot come away from here with good points.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: 20th placed qualifier Pierre Gasly of France and Alpine F1 walks in\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Esteban Ocon of France driving the (31) Alpine F1 A523 Renault on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: 20th placed qualifier Pierre Gasly of France and Alpine F1 walks in the Pitlane during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

But Hulkenberg rather emulated what his team mate had done here last season by making it all the way to Q3 in an incredible display. He lost his only lap time to track limits in the top 10 shootout but it wouldn&#8217;t have been enough to lift him ahead of Ocon anyway.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.highlights-watch-the-action-from-a-tight-qualifying-battle-in-bahrain-as.2OfVOuTLJunB6dzQXMze38.html\">HIGHLIGHTS: Watch the action from a tight qualifying battle in Bahrain as Verstappen leads Red Bull 1-2</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Nico Hulkenberg, 10th, No time set in Q3</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t perfect in Q3 unfortunately, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to let that ruin my day and my mood. I think it was pretty decent &#8211; I was pretty happy how I was able to produce and deliver the laps. I think we saw already yesterday how over one lap we&#8217;re in a decent spot and quite competitive, but the real test will come tomorrow. The big emphasis and focus is there, I expect a really tough battle and race but I&#8217;m excited and looking forward to it.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Magnussen, 17th, 1:31.892</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We got traffic in the final corner on the second run. It was so close &#8211; the whole field was bunched up &#8211; so if we lose a little bit, it&#8217;s game over. It&#8217;s a little bit unfortunate but the race is tomorrow, and we&#8217;ll try to do better there. There&#8217;s still stuff to work on, so we&#8217;ll see how we go in the race.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Guenther Steiner, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a pretty good day for us today. I think we now know what we can do this year and I think Nico did a fantastic job on his comeback. We had two down points, Kevin going out Q1. Today was not his day but he knows what he can do and he&#8217;s upbeat about what the car is doing, so tomorrow is another day for him to score points. With Nico in Q3, we didn&#8217;t end up where we wanted to but P10 is very good for us. The whole team did a fantastic job and all the work that was put in last year and over winter to make and develop this car has come to fruition, so well done to everybody.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Nico Hulkenberg of Germany driving the (27) Haas F1 VF-23 Ferrari\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Kevin Magnussen of Denmark driving the (20) Haas F1 VF-23 Ferrari on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Nico Hulkenberg of Germany driving the (27) Haas F1 VF-23 Ferrari locks a wheel under braking during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

Piastri went out at the first time of asking in his debut qualifying session, and while Norris did make Q2, he couldn&#8217;t make it to the top 10 shootout. The team didn&#8217;t start last season strongly either but soon managed to fight their way forward, and they will be hoping for a similar recovery this year.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.sargeant-piastri-and-de-vries-find-reasons-to-be-optimistic-despite-all.2g97SjXJvXiR5NrIY9kUJe.html\">READ MORE: Sargeant, Piastri and De Vries find reasons to be optimistic despite all three rookies dropping out in Q1 in Bahrain</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Lando Norris, 11th, 1:31.381</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;P11 in the first qualifying of the year, I would say I&#8217;m reasonably happy with that. I think we pretty much got everything out of the car. There maybe was a tenth left in it but I needed two tenths to gain any positions. It was a tough qualifying, it was very close between all the midfield and even the top cars, to be honest. It was a little bit better than I was thinking coming into the session, so we&#8217;ll take it. It&#8217;s a long race ahead tomorrow and a track we can overtake on, so hopefully we can move forward.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Oscar Piastri, 18th, 1:32.101</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Obviously it&#8217;s not what we were looking for there. The red flag compromised us a bit and I just didn&#8217;t nail it on the second set of tyres. That said, it was my first F1 qualifying and it is a long season ahead. We&#8217;ll do our homework and see what we can do. Tomorrow is another day.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>James Key, Executive Director, Technical</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Today saw a very busy first qualifying session of the season. Q1 was disrupted with a red flag and a scramble at the end of the session, which was a real shame as it left us with a compromised first run, with the tyres not up to temperature, and then a second run filled with traffic. Oscar just missed out, but he&#8217;s shown good pace all weekend and we know he can recover from this. He did a very disciplined job in his first qualifying session. Lando did a good job to get through to Q2 and narrowly missed out on the top 10.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We know we&#8217;ve got a bit of performance to find, and we have always said that was going to be the case with this configuration of car, but I have to say it was very, very close today. The grid has really tightened around us and it&#8217;s all to play for tomorrow. With decent long-run pace we can make good with both cars and target points tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: 18th placed qualifier Oscar Piastri of Australia and McLaren walks in\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Lando Norris of Great Britain driving the (4) McLaren MCL60 Mercedes\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: 18th placed qualifier Oscar Piastri of Australia and McLaren walks in the Pitlane during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

Nonetheless, it was a solid effort and with Zhou only 0.030s behind his team mate, it bodes well for a very close intra-team fight all season. If those two can keep pushing each other, points should follow.</p>\n<p><strong>Valtteri Bottas, 12th, 1:31.443</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a straightforward qualifying session for us, and starting from P12 we will be definitely aiming for a place in the points. I&#8217;m quite happy about the laps I delivered and it&#8217;s good to see how Zhou was able to push me as well: we were just a bit short of Q3, but the midfield is really close and everything can still happen. From what we have seen in testing, we are not bad in race trim, and it will be interesting to see how tyre degradation will affect different cars: it&#8217;s quite difficult to predict how the race will shape up, but we&#8217;re going to give it our best shot.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Zhou Guanyu, 13th, 1:31.473</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Even from outside of the top 10, I feel we have the potential to gain a few positions during tomorrow&#8217;s race: last year we were able to climb up the field, and I see no reason why we can&#8217;t repeat what we have done before. It will be a tight fight, once again, and points are definitely the target. Looking at our performance from practice, we are in the mix for the top ten and it will often be a case of who can put everything together on the day: we went really close to it today, but ultimately fell a bit short. Still, there&#8217;s everything to play for tomorrow and I&#8217;m confident we can do a good job.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Alessandro Alunni Bravi, Team Chief</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s result is a good first step and a platform on which we can build on to score points tomorrow. We can be happy about the way our team executed qualifying today: both drivers did well and the whole crew, here and in Hinwil, stood up to the task. We expected the midfield to be an incredibly tight affair, and tonight&#8217;s result confirms just how close the battle will be. There are minimal gaps between all the cars around us and a single tenth can make the difference between quite a few positions: even though we missed out on Q3, we are still in the mix for the points. Our focus shifts to Sunday now: we need to prepare our best race plan, making sure we find a way to make the most of the good long-run pace we showed in testing and practice. I am confident we can have a good showing tomorrow and deliver a good result to the team back at home.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Zhou Guanyu of China driving the (24) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari in the\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari in the Pitlane during final practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

The final lap in Q1 was crucial, but unfortunately, I lost the rear. Our long-run performance has been looking more promising than our short-run pace, so that should provide for more performance tomorrow. The midfield is tight and competitive, so we need to make sure we gain some positions. It will be challenge, but we have tonight to evaluate our data.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Yuki Tsunoda, 14th, 1:32.510</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t expect to get into Q2, but getting through was very positive for myself and the team. Of course, I was frustrated we didn&#8217;t have new tyres for Q2, but we knew that was the plan from the beginning. We haven&#8217;t tested the long-runs in these conditions, but we&#8217;ll dig through the data extensively tonight to be able to build the strongest possible car going into tomorrow, especially in terms of finding grip. At the same time, I am happy with my performance today, but ultimately tomorrow is when it counts. We are aiming for points, and we know it won&#8217;t be the easiest race from what we have learnt from testing last week, but anything can happen.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Jody Egginton, Technical Director</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We had a clear picture of what the primary limitations of the car were on Friday night, and it&#8217;s fair to say that the changes made overnight improved the balance of the car in FP3 &amp; qualifying. This is promising, but there is still much to do to get the car to where we want it. Yuki has delivered a good performance, extracting pretty much everything from the car, whilst Nyck has also put on a solid first qualifying. He&#8217;s made good progress, and more importantly, provided excellent feedback on what the car is doing and what he needs from it. As you would expect, we are not satisfied with the performance shown by the AT04 so far, but tomorrow&#8217;s race is another key milestone, and aero developments will be coming through in the next events.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Yuki Tsunoda of Scuderia AlphaTauri and Japan  during qualifying ahead\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Nyck de Vries of Netherlands driving the (21) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan and Scuderia AlphaTauri and Viki Gomez practice\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">3</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Yuki Tsunoda of Scuderia AlphaTauri and Japan  during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

It was a good showing from the American, who did say before the season that qualifying was his strength. As for Albon, he made Q2 but only ran once in that segment, and was fighting a very fidgety car. After running wide, he aborted his lap and didn&#8217;t set a time.</p>\n<p><strong>Logan Sargeant, 16th, 1:31.652</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It's a dream come true to go out and qualify in Formula 1. We had good pace today and the team deserved to have both cars in Q2. A slight mistake in Sector 1 cost me as I struggled to find my brake point with the change of wind at Turn 1. However, we've laid a good foundation for ourselves to build off going forward. I think we had the car in a great window this evening. In terms of balance it was right where I wanted it, I just needed to put it together slightly better.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It's going to be a pretty special feeling when the lights go out tomorrow. I'll try to get off the line clean, have a good first lap and build from there.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Alex Albon, 15th, No time set in Q2</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We had some front wing damage in Qualifying, and we lost one of the flaps, so we didn&#8217;t complete a lap in Q2. It&#8217;s disappointing as, looking at the times in Q2, I really believe we could have made it to Q3.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a bit disappointed after being P9 in Q1 and I feel like we deserved more than where we qualified but I think if you look at where we were this time last year and where we are at this year, apart from Aston Martin, we&#8217;re the team that has made the biggest step forward. I&#8217;m really proud of everyone at the team and at the factory and things are going in the right direction.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We really do come alive when the track becomes cold and I would say our race pace is stronger than our qualifying pace, so let&#8217;s see what happens tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Dave Robson, Head of Vehicle Performance</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;A frustrating result this evening but one that shows good promise. Logan was extremely unlucky not to get into Q2 having set the same lap time as Norris.\nWhilst Alex progressed to Q2 and was in a great position to set a good lap time, he had to abort his flying lap when an adjuster on his front wing failed, causing the flap to drop. Having completed so much running last week without an issue, it is frustrating to have it today in such an important session.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We can take a lot of positives from today as we look to translate the performance into a solid and forward-looking race plan. Both drivers know how to compile a strong race stint at this circuit, and everyone in Bahrain and in Grove are looking forward to helping them make good progress.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Logan Sargeant of United States driving the (2) Williams FW45 Mercedes\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Alexander Albon of Thailand and Williams prepares to drive in the\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Logan Sargeant of United States driving the (2) Williams FW45 Mercedes in the Pitlane during final practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

Qualifying was run entirely on the soft, given the performance gaps between the compounds, with Verstappen beating last year&#8217;s pole time from Charles Leclerc.

Overall, it was quite a good qualifying, we recovered well with the performance. It\u2019s great for the whole Team to have a one-two start tomorrow, and to have Checo up there as well is really promising. A lot of things can happen during a race as we all know, but I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what we can do out there on track as a Team.\u201d Sergio Perez, 2nd, 1:29.846 \u201cWhen you miss pole position by a tenth of a second you always think there is a bit more you could have given, that is only a braking zone or something. It was really close out there today, look at the competition from Q2 and Q3, if you didn\u2019t get a perfect lap then you were P5. We made some compromises in qualifying for tomorrow\u2019s race and hopefully that will pay off so we can have a very strong race car. I am more comfortable with the car; the rear end of this car is a bit more planted, so I am able to work with it a little better so that\u2019s a positive for me. I think Ferrari will be in the mix for the race, along with Aston Martin and Mercedes. We hadn\u2019t seen this kind of pace from Ferrari until today, so I think they have been hiding quite a bit. If Charles was to do his final run, he would have been in with a shot for pole position. I think managing the tyre degradation will be crucial tomorrow and it will be really important for us to concentrate on our own race.\u201d Christian Horner, Team Principal \u201cGreat start to the season in what turned out to be a very close qualifying. Both drivers managed to navigate their way into Q3 with the two sets of the softer tyres available. To lock out the front row is the best possible start for tomorrow\u2019s race, but, the points are on Sunday, and as we know from last year, it\u2019s important to finish. As I say though, it\u2019s a great start from the drivers and the Team, but plenty of work still to do as we look to convert these excellent grid positions into points tomorrow.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 3 BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Pole position qualifier Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle Red Bull Racing and Second placed qualifier Sergio Perez of Mexico and Oracle Red Bull Racing talk in parc ferme during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

But the team opted not to send Leclerc out for a second push lap in Q3, opting instead to save a fresh set of softs for the race itself.

Several teams seem to be quite close, which makes things more exciting for drivers and fans, and I think it's good for the sport.

It\u2019s been a difficult build-up to qualifying for me, not having had a clean day yesterday, but we reacted well today. I lost a bit in sector 2 in a couple of twitchy corners, but apart from that the feeling overall was better. \"Now we\u2019re looking forward to tomorrow.

We were P1 in both Q1 and Q2 so it was looking good for the fight for pole, but then we decided with Charles to save one set of new tyres for tomorrow\u2019s race, whereas with Carlos we used another new set since it was such a tight qualifying and a new tyre made the difference. Starting from the second row is actually a positive result considering that we will have the only driver with an extra set of new Soft tyres, so I am more than happy with this first qualifying. For tomorrow, when the points are scored, we need to put everything together and manage degradation. We have carried out some good race simulations, it\u2019s a long season and tomorrow\u2019s race is just the first step.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Carlos Sainz of Spain driving the (55) Ferrari SF-23 on track during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

I must say a big well done to the whole team \u2013 back at base and here at the track \u2013 for their constant hard work to get us to this point. The goal has been to take a step forward and our performance across today indicates we have done just that. We can race well from those grid positions and target scoring points with both cars. Huge credit to Lance for his performance today, especially given his situation, and having missed all of winter testing. His determination to get back in the car has been very impressive and he has done a super job to qualify in eighth.

Given they only had one run each and had to go out midway through before the track had fully ramped up, it certainly isn\u2019t all doom and gloom for the Silver Arrows, but both drivers will have their work cut out to move forward in what looks an incredibly tight front pack.

We did some great work overnight and the car felt much better in FP3. Overall, Qualifying was OK. I thought we might struggle to get into Q3 yesterday, but we didn't. We were in a fight. We don't know if we have the same race pace that we showed last year but I'm hoping we can be in the fight amongst the group behind Red Bull. It's really all going to depend on what our long-run pace is like. I am genuinely happy for Aston Martin. It's amazing to see their progress and the steps that they have taken. I am happy for Fernando as he's been here way longer than me so it's good to have him back in the mix! I'm sure we will have some good races.\" George Russell, 6th, 1:30.340 \"Today was a lot better than we expected, particularly after yesterday. We had a tough Friday; we expected to add a little bit of performance overnight, but we exceeded expectations. The changes we made we thought we might find a tenth, but we found close to five or six tenths, so we need to fully understand why that was. It's positive news but after FP3, we just focused on maximising performance. The car is feeling nice to drive so we are in a much better starting place than we were with the W13. We can now focus on adding global performance rather than problem solving. Tomorrow, we are in a good place to fight for third. Qualifying three tenths behind Ferrari when they have probably been the fastest car on single lap pace is positive. Fernando is probably more of a dark horse than Ferrari.\" Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport \"The gap to the very front isn't ridiculous considering we only ran one new soft tyre at the end of Q3. Nevertheless, it's not where we want to be and not what we had aimed for over the winter. We know what the gap is and what we need to find, or more, to win. Neither driver had a clean lap in the final run. There was probably another tenth-and-a-half still in there but it likely wouldn't have changed much. We maybe could have overtaken Alonso with both cars, but this is where we are. We are super critical of ourselves and what we need to achieve. There is no such thing as a sacred cow in our team, and we look at everything. The whole Team thinks like that, so we just need to get our heads together and work out the next steps from here. But first we race tomorrow - and we will be giving it everything we've got to move forward up the field.\" Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director \"Clearly, we're disappointed to be so far off pole, but we looked much further off yesterday. It's encouraging that the car responded to the overnight changes, and we've managed to improve a few of the issues like the high-speed cornering. Through the morning session the car was behaving quite predictably given the hotter conditions. There was a bit of fine-tuning going into qualifying and early on, it looked like we were in a pretty good place. As the sessions went on the others seemed to be finding a bit more pace. We also only had one set of tyres for the final part of Qualifying so that added up to leaving us with a gap that's bigger than we'd like but one that we'll be working hard to close down. Our straight-line speed looks strong, and our degradation seems to be in a reasonable place; the Red Bulls are out of reach from what we have seen but it would be good if we can get into a race with the Ferraris and Aston Martins.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W14 on track during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

He was out anyway having only managed the 17th best time, before the stewards deemed he has exceeded track limits, which dropped him to P20. Ocon though used his experience to scrape into the top 10, one of only two midfield cars to do so. He starts ninth and will be looking to get his points tally up and running at the earliest of opportunities. Esteban Ocon, 9th, 1:30.984 \u201cIt felt good to be out there and finally really pushing the car to see what it can do and where we stand. Getting through to Q3 is definitely a good way to start the season. We are happy with the progress we have made since the pre-season test, and this is the best the car has felt on track so far this year. Our competitors in front are quick, and we have plenty of work ahead of us, but we\u2019ve got a car that can get into the points and that will be the goal for the first race of the season.\u201d Pierre Gasly, 20th, 1:32.181 \u201cClearly, this is not the start to the season we wanted being knocked out in Q1, that said, it means we have everything to gain for tomorrow\u2019s race and I\u2019m definitely feeling positive that we can still come away with points from this weekend. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t quite feel at one with the car today and that meant we were way below where our true level is. There\u2019s a lot of work ahead of us to continue our understanding of the car and I\u2019m confident we will come back stronger for our next qualifying session. My focus is on tomorrow and I\u2019m really looking forward to the race and giving it my all.\u201d Alan Permane, Sporting Director \u201cOverall, we have mixed feelings after today\u2019s first Qualifying of the season with Esteban in ninth and Pierre in twentieth. In general, that\u2019s not where we aim to be, and we certainly have improvements to make to ensure we\u2019re qualifying in much stronger positions at later races. Pierre is certainly disappointed to be out in Q1. We have a lot to review on his side to understand what happened as clearly the car had much more pace than that. Esteban did a very good job and had three smooth sessions, though, looking at the timesheets, ninth place is probably where we deserve to be today. We\u2019re definitely ready for tomorrow\u2019s race as our high fuel running looked good in pre-season testing and in Free Practice 2 yesterday. Pierre can set his sights forward from the back of the grid as this race tends to have plenty of overtaking. For Esteban, he\u2019s well in contention and there\u2019s no reason why we cannot come away from here with good points.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: 20th placed qualifier Pierre Gasly of France and Alpine F1 walks in the Pitlane during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

But Hulkenberg rather emulated what his team mate had done here last season by making it all the way to Q3 in an incredible display. He lost his only lap time to track limits in the top 10 shootout but it wouldn\u2019t have been enough to lift him ahead of Ocon anyway. HIGHLIGHTS: Watch the action from a tight qualifying battle in Bahrain as Verstappen leads Red Bull 1-2 Nico Hulkenberg, 10th, No time set in Q3 \u201cIt wasn\u2019t perfect in Q3 unfortunately, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to let that ruin my day and my mood. I think it was pretty decent \u2013 I was pretty happy how I was able to produce and deliver the laps. I think we saw already yesterday how over one lap we\u2019re in a decent spot and quite competitive, but the real test will come tomorrow. The big emphasis and focus is there, I expect a really tough battle and race but I\u2019m excited and looking forward to it.\u201d Kevin Magnussen, 17th, 1:31.892 \u201cWe got traffic in the final corner on the second run. It was so close \u2013 the whole field was bunched up \u2013 so if we lose a little bit, it\u2019s game over. It\u2019s a little bit unfortunate but the race is tomorrow, and we\u2019ll try to do better there. There\u2019s still stuff to work on, so we\u2019ll see how we go in the race.\u201d Guenther Steiner, Team Principal \u201cIt was a pretty good day for us today. I think we now know what we can do this year and I think Nico did a fantastic job on his comeback. We had two down points, Kevin going out Q1. Today was not his day but he knows what he can do and he\u2019s upbeat about what the car is doing, so tomorrow is another day for him to score points. With Nico in Q3, we didn\u2019t end up where we wanted to but P10 is very good for us. The whole team did a fantastic job and all the work that was put in last year and over winter to make and develop this car has come to fruition, so well done to everybody.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Nico Hulkenberg of Germany driving the (27) Haas F1 VF-23 Ferrari locks a wheel under braking during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

Piastri went out at the first time of asking in his debut qualifying session, and while Norris did make Q2, he couldn\u2019t make it to the top 10 shootout. The team didn\u2019t start last season strongly either but soon managed to fight their way forward, and they will be hoping for a similar recovery this year. READ MORE: Sargeant, Piastri and De Vries find reasons to be optimistic despite all three rookies dropping out in Q1 in Bahrain Lando Norris, 11th, 1:31.381 \u201cP11 in the first qualifying of the year, I would say I\u2019m reasonably happy with that. I think we pretty much got everything out of the car. There maybe was a tenth left in it but I needed two tenths to gain any positions. It was a tough qualifying, it was very close between all the midfield and even the top cars, to be honest. It was a little bit better than I was thinking coming into the session, so we\u2019ll take it. It\u2019s a long race ahead tomorrow and a track we can overtake on, so hopefully we can move forward.\u201d Oscar Piastri, 18th, 1:32.101 \u201cObviously it\u2019s not what we were looking for there. The red flag compromised us a bit and I just didn\u2019t nail it on the second set of tyres. That said, it was my first F1 qualifying and it is a long season ahead. We\u2019ll do our homework and see what we can do. Tomorrow is another day.\u201d James Key, Executive Director, Technical \u201cToday saw a very busy first qualifying session of the season. Q1 was disrupted with a red flag and a scramble at the end of the session, which was a real shame as it left us with a compromised first run, with the tyres not up to temperature, and then a second run filled with traffic. Oscar just missed out, but he\u2019s shown good pace all weekend and we know he can recover from this. He did a very disciplined job in his first qualifying session. Lando did a good job to get through to Q2 and narrowly missed out on the top 10. \u201cWe know we\u2019ve got a bit of performance to find, and we have always said that was going to be the case with this configuration of car, but I have to say it was very, very close today. The grid has really tightened around us and it\u2019s all to play for tomorrow. With decent long-run pace we can make good with both cars and target points tomorrow.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: 18th placed qualifier Oscar Piastri of Australia and McLaren walks in the Pitlane during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

Nonetheless, it was a solid effort and with Zhou only 0.030s behind his team mate, it bodes well for a very close intra-team fight all season. If those two can keep pushing each other, points should follow. Valtteri Bottas, 12th, 1:31.443 \u201cIt was a straightforward qualifying session for us, and starting from P12 we will be definitely aiming for a place in the points. I\u2019m quite happy about the laps I delivered and it\u2019s good to see how Zhou was able to push me as well: we were just a bit short of Q3, but the midfield is really close and everything can still happen. From what we have seen in testing, we are not bad in race trim, and it will be interesting to see how tyre degradation will affect different cars: it\u2019s quite difficult to predict how the race will shape up, but we\u2019re going to give it our best shot.\u201d Zhou Guanyu, 13th, 1:31.473 \u201cEven from outside of the top 10, I feel we have the potential to gain a few positions during tomorrow\u2019s race: last year we were able to climb up the field, and I see no reason why we can\u2019t repeat what we have done before. It will be a tight fight, once again, and points are definitely the target. Looking at our performance from practice, we are in the mix for the top ten and it will often be a case of who can put everything together on the day: we went really close to it today, but ultimately fell a bit short. Still, there\u2019s everything to play for tomorrow and I\u2019m confident we can do a good job.\u201d Alessandro Alunni Bravi, Team Chief \u201cToday\u2019s result is a good first step and a platform on which we can build on to score points tomorrow. We can be happy about the way our team executed qualifying today: both drivers did well and the whole crew, here and in Hinwil, stood up to the task. We expected the midfield to be an incredibly tight affair, and tonight\u2019s result confirms just how close the battle will be. There are minimal gaps between all the cars around us and a single tenth can make the difference between quite a few positions: even though we missed out on Q3, we are still in the mix for the points. Our focus shifts to Sunday now: we need to prepare our best race plan, making sure we find a way to make the most of the good long-run pace we showed in testing and practice. I am confident we can have a good showing tomorrow and deliver a good result to the team back at home.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari in the Pitlane during final practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

As such, it was a decent effort by Tsunoda to make it into Q2, even if he couldn\u2019t progress from there. De Vries couldn\u2019t match that and exited in Q1, although Gasly\u2019s track limit infringement saved the Dutchman from qualifying last. READ MORE: Sargeant, Piastri and De Vries find reasons to be optimistic despite all three rookies dropping out in Q1 in Bahrain Nyck de Vries, 19th, 1:32.121 \u201cWe would\u2019ve liked to qualify higher today, but I didn\u2019t have the tyres in the correct window. The final lap in Q1 was crucial, but unfortunately, I lost the rear. Our long-run performance has been looking more promising than our short-run pace, so that should provide for more performance tomorrow. The midfield is tight and competitive, so we need to make sure we gain some positions. It will be challenge, but we have tonight to evaluate our data.\u201d Yuki Tsunoda, 14th, 1:32.510 \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect to get into Q2, but getting through was very positive for myself and the team. Of course, I was frustrated we didn\u2019t have new tyres for Q2, but we knew that was the plan from the beginning. We haven\u2019t tested the long-runs in these conditions, but we\u2019ll dig through the data extensively tonight to be able to build the strongest possible car going into tomorrow, especially in terms of finding grip. At the same time, I am happy with my performance today, but ultimately tomorrow is when it counts. We are aiming for points, and we know it won\u2019t be the easiest race from what we have learnt from testing last week, but anything can happen.\u201d Jody Egginton, Technical Director \u201cWe had a clear picture of what the primary limitations of the car were on Friday night, and it\u2019s fair to say that the changes made overnight improved the balance of the car in FP3 & qualifying. This is promising, but there is still much to do to get the car to where we want it. Yuki has delivered a good performance, extracting pretty much everything from the car, whilst Nyck has also put on a solid first qualifying. He\u2019s made good progress, and more importantly, provided excellent feedback on what the car is doing and what he needs from it. As you would expect, we are not satisfied with the performance shown by the AT04 so far, but tomorrow\u2019s race is another key milestone, and aero developments will be coming through in the next events.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 3 BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Yuki Tsunoda of Scuderia AlphaTauri and Japan during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

It was a good showing from the American, who did say before the season that qualifying was his strength. As for Albon, he made Q2 but only ran once in that segment, and was fighting a very fidgety car. After running wide, he aborted his lap and didn\u2019t set a time. Logan Sargeant, 16th, 1:31.652 \u201cIt's a dream come true to go out and qualify in Formula 1. We had good pace today and the team deserved to have both cars in Q2. A slight mistake in Sector 1 cost me as I struggled to find my brake point with the change of wind at Turn 1. However, we've laid a good foundation for ourselves to build off going forward. I think we had the car in a great window this evening. In terms of balance it was right where I wanted it, I just needed to put it together slightly better. \u201cIt's going to be a pretty special feeling when the lights go out tomorrow. I'll try to get off the line clean, have a good first lap and build from there.\u201d Alex Albon, 15th, No time set in Q2 \u201cWe had some front wing damage in Qualifying, and we lost one of the flaps, so we didn\u2019t complete a lap in Q2. It\u2019s disappointing as, looking at the times in Q2, I really believe we could have made it to Q3. \u201cI\u2019m a bit disappointed after being P9 in Q1 and I feel like we deserved more than where we qualified but I think if you look at where we were this time last year and where we are at this year, apart from Aston Martin, we\u2019re the team that has made the biggest step forward. I\u2019m really proud of everyone at the team and at the factory and things are going in the right direction. \u201cWe really do come alive when the track becomes cold and I would say our race pace is stronger than our qualifying pace, so let\u2019s see what happens tomorrow.\u201d Dave Robson, Head of Vehicle Performance \u201cA frustrating result this evening but one that shows good promise. Logan was extremely unlucky not to get into Q2 having set the same lap time as Norris. Whilst Alex progressed to Q2 and was in a great position to set a good lap time, he had to abort his flying lap when an adjuster on his front wing failed, causing the flap to drop. Having completed so much running last week without an issue, it is frustrating to have it today in such an important session. \u201cWe can take a lot of positives from today as we look to translate the performance into a solid and forward-looking race plan. Both drivers know how to compile a strong race stint at this circuit, and everyone in Bahrain and in Grove are looking forward to helping them make good progress.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - MARCH 04: Logan Sargeant of United States driving the (2) Williams FW45 Mercedes in the Pitlane during final practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Bahrain at Bahrain International Circuit on March 04, 2023 in Bahrain, Bahrain.

While the Mexican got lucky, from there <a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.perez-relieved-his-tyre-didnt-blow-up-en-route-to-becoming-first-ever.28YCtYuhR6CQXbXrIYtCmD.html\">he drove a superb race</a> at a track he so often goes well at, and never seemed under undue pressure.  Verstappen was struggling by contract with the balance of his RB19 and in the end had to settle for second.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.i-learned-a-lot-of-things-verstappen-takes-the-positives-from-baku-despite.6Xq6FIGKhBT6ovoFYXccWO.html\">READ MORE: &#8216;I learned a lot of things&#8217; &#8211; Verstappen takes the positives from Baku despite losing out to team mate Perez</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Max Verstappen, 2nd</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Overall it was quite a good race. Of course, I was a bit unlucky with the safety car call, but I think in that second stint both of us were pushing flat out. We used every centimetre on that track and touched a few walls! It was a good Team result and there were a lot of learnings from this weekend to take forward to the rest of the season. We bought it home and a 1-2 for the Team was ideal, Checo had a great race and did very well today. I&#8217;m already looking forward to Miami and seeing what we can do there.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Sergio Perez, 1st</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It has been an unbelievable weekend, I am super pleased and I cannot say more about the Team, it has been a tremendous day for us and I am so proud of everyone. I want to say a big thanks to Thibaut, he is one of my mechanics who is at home for personal reasons, but he is still a very big part of our Team. The Team enjoy calling me the King of the Streets, I am super happy for them all. They have been tremendous all weekend, from the sprint race yesterday through to the way we executed the race today, it was perfect. I think today we were the fastest car on track and regardless of the safety car we would have won the race. I am definitely in the fight for the title, not just because of Baku, I believe I can be very good anywhere this season and now I am just thinking of Miami. There are a lot of races coming up and we must make sure we are on it.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Christian Horner, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Checo absolutely excelled today. He had the pace and really controlled the race, he benefitted from the timing of the safety car but it was a phenomenal performance from him today and all weekend. Hats off to him. We were unlucky with the safety car and the pit stop for Max. Sometimes things like that don&#8217;t go your way but that is racing and we will learn from it. Other than that it was an excellent performance from the whole team, another 1-2, our 25th! Things are clicking for us at the moment and it sets us up well for next week but it is still early days, there are 19 races and 5 more sprint races in this long season. With each race comes moments to savour but just as many learnings, we take those and move to the next challenge, preparation for Miami is already well under way, see you at the beach!&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Race winner Sergio Perez of Mexico and Oracle Red Bull Racing\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Race winner Sergio Perez of Mexico and Oracle Red Bull Racing\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Race winner Sergio Perez of Mexico and Oracle Red Bull Racing and\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">3</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Race winner Sergio Perez of Mexico and Oracle Red Bull Racing celebrates with teammates in parc ferme during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

From there, he had a lonely race in third but at least scored his first podium of the season. Sainz lost out to Alonso after the Safety Car peeled in, and came close to losing a place to Hamilton but in the end managed his tyres well enough to have enough rubber left to defend hard in the closing stages.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.leclerc-says-ferrari-absolutely-maximised-azerbaijan-weekend-after-claiming.3cebi7civvRc2WY0d8vKmm.html\">READ MORE: Leclerc says Ferrari 'absolutely maximised' Azerbaijan weekend after claiming first podium of season</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Charles Leclerc, 3rd</strong></p>\n<p>\"We are still not quite there in terms of race pace and we know that&#8217;s what we have to work on the most at the moment. We maximised every session throughout the weekend and couldn't have done anything differently, so that&#8217;s something to be happy about and the team did a great job. The bottom line is that we have to focus on race pace and tyre management and push to make even more progress in the coming races.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Carlos Sainz, 5th</strong></p>\n<p>\"This has been a very difficult weekend. P5 brings home some points but I must put my hand up and admit I lacked confidence under braking and the pace was not there. On the Medium tyre I could push a bit more, but with the harder compound I simply didn&#8217;t feel the car. Now I look forward to a reset, as Miami is just around the corner and I can&#8217;t wait to jump in the car again and keep pushing.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Fred Vasseur, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>\"Overall, this has been a positive weekend for the team. We took two pole positions and one podium finish with Charles and our overall points total, thanks also to Carlos&#8217; fifth place, is satisfactory. There were signs of progress in Melbourne, but they were overshadowed by the poor race result. In the four week break, we worked hard in Maranello and here in Baku we have made further progress which translated into a good result.</p>\n<p>\"We definitely are back to where we wanted to be in terms of qualifying, but there&#8217;s still a significant gap to Red Bull in the race. However, we aim to fight them for the win and we are gearing up to do just that. It&#8217;s a morale booster for the whole team to finish on the podium, something which we will carry forward as we prepare for next weekend&#8217;s race in Miami.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Third placed Charles Leclerc of Monaco and Ferrari celebrates on the\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Carlos Sainz of Spain and Ferrari looks on on the grid prior to the F1\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Third placed Charles Leclerc of Monaco and Ferrari celebrates on the podium during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

He was finding the afternoon&#8217;s running easy enough to spend much of the day chatting to his engineer about his set up, and suggesting improvements that could be utilised by his team mate behind. Speaking of, things seem pretty harmonious at Aston Martin with Stroll saying he wouldn&#8217;t attack when the duo were running line astern, while Alonso said he was perfectly happy if he tried a move.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.ferrari-were-quite-lucky-declares-alonso-as-he-narrowly-misses-out-on-podium.PluG4Ec5n7wQ3Cr9uH5Cq.html\">READ MORE: 'Ferrari were quite lucky' declares Alonso as he narrowly misses out on podium finish at Azerbaijan GP</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Fernando Alonso, 4th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I think we had a tricky weekend with the DRS issue on Friday and Saturday, but despite this we have finished only one second away from the podium at the chequered flag. With that in mind, I have to be happy with fourth position and our overall performance which was encouraging all race. Thankfully today the DRS seemed to work fine, and our tyre management was strong. I thought the tailwind was quite random and here in Baku you are always on the edge. We only have to wait a few days before we go racing again, so let&#8217;s see what we can do next week in Miami!&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Lance Stroll, 7th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was pretty tough out there today. I was happy with my start, as well as the Safety Car restart, but I wasn&#8217;t feeling super comfortable with the car once the race got going and made a slight mistake. A little misjudgement can end your day here, so I was fortunate to get away with brushing the wall and managed to continue with the race. Once Lewis [Hamilton] passed me, it was just about maintaining position and holding off George [Russell] for the remaining laps. He was pushing hard, but we managed the tyres well and I was able to keep him behind me. As a team, we definitely have a few things to work though ahead of Miami, but I think we need to be pleased to come away from the first Sprint weekend of the year with a decent haul of points to maintain second in the Constructors&#8217; Championship.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Mike Krack, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Another well-executed weekend by the entire team and we leave Baku with a combined total of 22 points. That is a good return from quite a challenging event on a very demanding street circuit. Full credit to the drivers who did an excellent job to make progress from their starting positions. They managed the Hard tyres well over a long stint, while maintaining good race pace, and brought the cars home safely to round off a clean weekend. This sets us up nicely for our first trip of the year to the United States next week as we get ready to entertain the fans in Miami.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Lance Stroll of Canada and Aston Martin F1 Team, Logan Sargeant of\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W14 leads Fernando Alonso of Spain driving the (14) Aston Martin AMR23 Mercedes on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

As such his team mate actually jumped him, but Russell had a poor restart and was helpless to fight off his team mate on track as Hamilton streamed past. From there, Hamilton also picked off Stroll but ran out of time to make it past Sainz, while Russell was left with a free pit stop late on which he used to grab the bonus point for fastest lap.</p>\n<p><strong>Lewis Hamilton, 6th</strong></p>\n<p>\"The timing of the Safety Car wasn't ideal! I couldn't get bogged down in that frustration though. I had to keep my head down and get focused on attacking. That's what I did, and I got right back in the race. I really enjoyed those battles with the cars around me. The Ferrari of Sainz was just a little bit quicker on the straight than us, even with the DRS open. I gave it everything I had to get past though.</p>\n<p>\"I'm continuously proud of my team. We didn't have the pace that we did in Melbourne, which is not the greatest, but there is no lack of motivation in this team. We're all super hungry, and hopefully this is the beginning of something better in the coming races. Once I get that confidence in the car, the pace will come.\"</p>\n<p><strong>George Russell, 8th</strong></p>\n<p>\"I'm a little bit disappointed with myself today. I made a really good start and got in a decent position. I made a good move on Stroll to get past him into the pit lane but I then made a mess of the restart. I was defending from Lance and almost ran into the back of Fernando (Alonso). I then ran wide and got my tyres dirty. Ultimately that's why both Lance and Lewis got past. From there, it was line astern.</p>\n<p>\"I'll take the extra point for fastest lap but the only reason we had that opportunity was because we were in a bad position. It was close pace-wise between ourselves, Ferrari and Aston Martin and small differences can make a big change in terms of results. Whether we finish P4 or P8 though, it's far from first so we've got a lot of work to do.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport</strong></p>\n<p>\"Today was not a thriller. There was very little overtaking even with a big pace difference. We headed into a sub optimum set-up direction during FP1 and by the time we realised it was too late, and the car was in parc ferm&#233; conditions. It's the same for everyone though under this format.</p>\n<p>\"The pace in free air today looked similar between ourselves, the Ferraris and the Aston Martins. It was hard to tell who was ultimately quicker though, because with the difficulty of overtaking you are stuck where you are stuck. The Red Bulls meanwhile sailed away into the sunset on merit. If we can get the platform right though, I think we can close that gap this year. It's not about adding points of downforce, more giving the drivers a car that they have confidence in.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director</strong></p>\n<p>\"We're never going to get excited about sixth and eighth place, but it was a day where the car wasn't particularly quick and neither driver had much luck during the race. Lewis had a decent opening lap; he'd started to get a bit of pressure from Alonso towards the end of the stint, so we came in to protect the position. Unfortunately, that was the lap before the Safety Car, so he lost out. A good restart helped the recovery, but he just couldn't get past Sainz.</p>\n<p>\"George had a really good opening lap, getting through some key cars early on. He was able to take the stop under the Safety Car but then struggled on the restart and lost a couple of places. Similarly to Lewis, he just couldn't make a pass despite having a bit more pace so our only consolation was a point for fastest lap at the end. We haven't got long to wait before we are bringing some more performance to the car and in the meantime, we just need to focus on collecting as many points as possible. We're hoping the car will be a bit better suited to the track in Miami and looking forward to being able to get back on track in just a few days.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: George Russell of Great Britain driving the (63) Mercedes AMG Petronas\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W14 comes in for a pitstop during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

It was as good a result as I was going to get and the best we could achieve today. P9 really doesn&#8217;t sound like a lot but it was the best we can do at the moment. We got a bit unlucky with the Safety Car happening just after we had pit. I then got stuck behind Hulkenberg, but we got a couple of points on the board, which is a solid result, plus we got some good things out of the new parts we bought to track. So, I&#8217;m happy with that and we&#8217;ll try to improve again in Miami.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Oscar Piastri, 11th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a shame to miss out on points by one spot, but we were just lacking a bit of pace in the middle of the race, so there wasn&#8217;t really much more we could do. I&#8217;m happy I survived the weekend after being unwell and we&#8217;ve got some really good learning in the bank. I certainly learned a lot about the tyres in that race, and how to manage them better, so all of that will help us fight for points next time. Thanks to the team here and back at the factory for getting the upgrades out to us, it's definitely helped. We go again in Miami.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Andrea Stella, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;An interesting weekend in Azerbaijan with the new Sprint format. Our main objective for the weekend remained preparing for the race: this was where the most points were available. The top four teams are a little bit ahead at the moment, so the mission was to be at the head of the midfield. We achieved that thanks to the upgrades we fitted this weekend. Thanks go to the team back at the factory and at track for helping us bring these parts to the car. Over the next few races, we will be able to verify how much of that is a genuine improvement, and how much was track-specific.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Lando, once again, was rock solid. Another clean weekend brings us a couple of very useful points. We were highly impressed with Oscar too. He&#8217;s been unwell this weekend but managed to focus on the job, also delivering a clean weekend with no mistakes. Thank you to our excellent medical staff for their continuous support throughout the weekend. We hope he&#8217;ll be feeling better in a few days when we start again in Miami.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Lando Norris of Great Britain driving the (4) McLaren MCL60 Mercedes\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Oscar Piastri of Australia driving the (81) McLaren MCL60 Mercedes on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Lando Norris of Great Britain driving the (4) McLaren MCL60 Mercedes on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

That moment brought out the Safety Car that proved to be so pivotal. As for Tsunoda, he dropped out of the top 10 at the start after getting baulked on the first lap, but played the long game and overtook Hulkenberg late on to get back into the points, holding Piastri at bay for his second P10 finish in a row.</p>\n<p><strong>Nyck de Vries, DNF</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;The accident today was fully my mistake. It was very silly and unnecessary and that responsibility is on me. I am disappointed with myself but that&#8217;s the way it is. There are positives to take away from this weekend and I&#8217;ll try to look at them. I am happy to be racing again next week so I forget this weekend as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Yuki Tsunoda, 10th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a tough race today but the team, especially the mechanics, did a great job to repair the car after yesterday. The engineers found a strong set-up, even if we lost some time in sector two. We didn&#8217;t get many chances to do long runs this weekend but to be able to demonstrate a strong pace, and build on this performance throughout the race, was awesome from the team. I am also happy with my performance. I was consistent, and being sandwiched between the two McLarens meant any mistake would cost us the point. It took a lot of concentration but in the end, we were able to achieve another top-ten finish. There is still room for development and improvement to fight for points consistently, but I have confidence in my team to race stronger in the future.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Franz Tost, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Firstly, congratulations to Red Bull Racing for another front-row finish. As for our weekend, we came to this race with some aero updates, and I&#8217;m pleased to say they seem to work very well. The team in Bicester did a fantastic job because we have been competitive from the very beginning of the weekend. The highlight was of course Friday&#8217;s qualifying, where Yuki finished in eighth position. As for today&#8217;s race, he was overtaken by Stroll and Russell on the first lap, but this is what I expected as their cars are simply faster than ours. Nevertheless, Yuki did a fantastic job. He was able to split the McLarens, staying quite close to Norris and keeping Piastri behind. Overall, a big congratulations to Yuki for another strong performance, which shows how much he is improving race by race. Unfortunately, Nyck had an accident, he touched the wall in turn 5, breaking the front left track rod, and that was the end of his race. Generally speaking, we have improved the car performance dramatically since the start of the season, so now I am even more looking forward to the next race in Miami.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Guillaume Dezoteux, Head of Vehicle Performance</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We are very happy to end the weekend with a point. Yuki drove a solid race, the strategy calls were right and the pit stop was competitive. At the start of the race, we knew it would be difficult to hold faster cars behind us, but Yuki remained focused, made no mistakes and settled in a train of cars with both McLarens, a Haas and an Alpine. We were continuously evaluating safety car scenarios and monitoring other cars to react, although in the end, there was nothing to react to. Nyck's race started well with an offset strategy. We decided to start on the hard tyre, chasing any opportunity to make ground through the pack. Unfortunately, he made contact with the inside of Turn 5 and broke his front left track rod, which forced him to stop on track. Overall, this weekend has been solid and the track layout has suited us better. There are similarities in Miami, so we will review everything in the next couple of days to prepare as best we can for next weekend.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04 on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: The car of Nyck de Vries of Netherlands and Scuderia AlphaTauri is\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04 on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

His car was okay to continue, but he spent most of the race stuck in a DRS train and unable to make progress. The same could be said for Sargeant, who pitted under the Safety Car but didn&#8217;t have the pace to really fight those around him. Better races to come from Williams, who need to find a way to convert their one-lap pace into race advantage.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.highlights-watch-as-sergio-perez-wins-the-2023-azerbaijan-grand-prix.4v3cZ8DYa87X8r18wvbon2.html\">HIGHLIGHTS: Watch as Sergio Perez wins the 2023 Azerbaijan Grand Prix</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Logan Sargeant, 16th</strong></p>\n<p>\"All things considered I learned a lot this weekend. In the race today, we got a bit unlucky with the safety car timing at the start and fell into a bit of a lonely, frustrating race. I was stuck behind Zhou for most of it. By the time he pitted it was just too late and I was too far disconnected from the pack ahead. However, when I did get in front, the car felt good, I was driving well, and the pace was not too bad at the end. I brought a set of hard tyres a long way and that&#8217;s all positive.</p>\n<p>\"Our one lap pace this weekend was good, and I was happy considering we only had one free practice session to go into qualifying and have a pretty good one. It was going to be an even better Sprint Shootout until the crash, so I&#8217;ll learn from that and move forward. The race wasn&#8217;t bad, it just fell out of our hands and was a lonely, boring one for most people.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Alex Albon, 12th</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was really tough out there today. I had some damage on my front wing for most of the race following contact with the McLaren, so there was a lot of management to do. It was tricky trying to keep the Haas behind me whilst staying close to Oscar, and not a lot of room for overtaking with the shortened DRS zones. We really did maximise this weekend and I think it was personally one of my strongest, especially coming off Australia. I think we definitely have more to find with the car, but I think I&#8217;m becoming at one with it, so hopefully we can keep this going.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Dave Robson, Head of Vehicle Performance</strong></p>\n<p>\"Alex suffered some front wing damage on the opening lap, which hurt the car balance and cost him downforce. Despite this he was able to put together another very strong race; he dealt with the pressure from Gasly and Magnussen brilliantly whilst also staying close to Piastri ahead. The timing of the early safety car was unfortunate for our strategy, but that is the nature of racing at Baku.</p>\n<p>Having missed the sprint race yesterday, Logan started the Grand Prix somewhat on the back foot but still put together a strong drive to fight with Zhou and Gasly. His pace and car management were competitive and gave him some very valuable learning for the future.</p>\n<p>\"We arrived in Baku for this new style sprint event expecting it to be a challenge. Although we rose to that challenge well and were able to put together a strong performance overall, it is frustrating not to get some points for our effort. Nonetheless, we head to Miami with some positive momentum and another good opportunity to challenge the top 10.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Alexander Albon of Thailand driving the (23) Williams FW45 Mercedes\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">1</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Alexander Albon of Thailand driving the (23) Williams FW45 Mercedes leads Pierre Gasly of France driving the (10) Alpine F1 A523 Renault on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

He tried hard from there on in, but wasn&#8217;t able to climb back into the points. Hulkenberg had started from the pit lane and went for a very long first stint in the hopes a late Safety Car would offer him a free pit stop, but his tyres went off the cliff and he dropped back through the field.</p>\n<p><strong>Nico Hulkenberg, 17th</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was hard work &#8211; I was head-down, focused. It was a quali race to be honest for me, that was all I had but it was okay for 40 laps or so and then at the end, unfortunately the tyres started to drop quite rapidly. The Safety Car didn&#8217;t come out and that&#8217;s what we needed with the strategy we pursued. Nevertheless, it was good learning. We elected for a pit lane start and changed the set up completely to something more conventional. We learned something, on the positive side, and now onto Miami where I think we&#8217;ll be more competitive.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Magnussen, 13th</strong></p>\n<p>\"We were stuck in traffic the whole race, we had pace for much more but just couldn&#8217;t pass. Unfortunately, with the wing we have it&#8217;s really fast with no DRS but with DRS it doesn&#8217;t really have a big impact. Overtaking is very difficult, defending is pretty good because without DRS we&#8217;re pretty fast. That little detail made the difference today because I think looking at the cars ahead I was way quicker than them but just couldn&#8217;t get past. A bit of the same story as last year as we were in the points until the end but this year, we had even more pace. Hopefully that carries onto Miami, and we will try again.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Guenther Steiner, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>\"Kevin got his front wing endplate knocked off at the start because Bottas in front of him locked up, so he couldn&#8217;t avoid him, and it was severe enough to make a front wing change. With Nico, we tried a different strategy and it didn&#8217;t work because the Safety Car came too early. All in all, the performance of the car was good and we could hold pace with the Alpine and McLaren. I think we just have to take this one as a little dip and come back in Miami, where maybe for our car it&#8217;s even better, being a medium-downforce circuit.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Kevin Magnussen of Denmark and Haas F1 looks on on the grid prior to\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Nico Hulkenberg of Germany driving the (27) Haas F1 VF-23 Ferrari on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Kevin Magnussen of Denmark and Haas F1 looks on on the grid prior to the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

Gasly pitted very early to get onto the hard compound, but as such lost out when the Safety Car came out. He pitted again, one of the few to try a two-stop strategy which wasn&#8217;t the quickest way to the flag. As for Ocon, he climbed into the top 10 after starting in the pit lane on the hard tyres, and pitted on the very last lap as he desperately tried to hang on for a second Safety Car, which never came.</p>\n<p><strong>Esteban Ocon, 15th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We gave it everything we could today, going for the Hail Mary strategy in the hope for a late Safety Car or incident, but things did not go our way. We can be proud with our efforts, pushing all the way to the end and extracting the most from the Hard tyres. I had a bit of a scary moment at the end of the race when I came into pit and saw people congregating in the Pit Lane even though the race had not ended. Fortunately, nothing happened, but we must make sure these scenarios don&#8217;t happen again. We were not where we want to be in terms of performance this weekend. And, after a weekend of learning, we have a chance to review and comeback stronger in Miami. I know we will do just that.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Pierre Gasly, 14th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a weekend all of us are keen to quickly move on from as it&#8217;s been a very frustrating one for all of us at the team. We have to make sure this kind of performance is not repeated again. Clearly, it is not where we should be and we need to come back stronger for Miami next week on a more conventional track. In terms of my race, we tried something different on strategy and hoped for some fortune, but in the end, we couldn&#8217;t do much more. I made a couple of moves, that&#8217;s always satisfying, but it&#8217;s much more rewarding when those overtakes are for points. I&#8217;m looking forward to racing in Miami next weekend.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Otmar Szafnauer, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a bitterly disappointing weekend for the team in Baku and we must not repeat this type of performance again. We very much started on the backfoot on Friday and since then we were not able to make any kind of recovery in any of the sessions. We were quite far off on car set-up on Friday during practice and with such limited running &#8211; notably with some reliability issues on both cars &#8211; we left ourselves with a mountain to climb for the remainder of the weekend. We must limit these problems going forward and begin all Grand Prix weekends on the front-foot to make sure we give ourselves the best possible chance on Saturday and Sunday to score points. We demonstrated our race pace in Australia and we have a better chance to validate our upgrade package in Miami.

Bottas collided with Magnussen at the start which dropped him back through the field, and from there struggled more than most with tyre wear. He pitted three times in the end on his way to last place. At least he saw the chequered flag though &#8211; Zhou was called in to the pits midway through to retire the car with technical issues.</p>\n<p><strong>Valtteri Bottas, 18th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t a great race for us and we were never in the mix for the points: we need to understand what happened and, most importantly, how to get back to being competitive. My race was hard from the start: I had a contact in turn two, I was on the outside and I was hit from the left and from behind, which left me with some damage. It was quite a long race after that: we tried to find a way back in, as anything can happen here, but eventually there weren&#8217;t any chances for us to rebuild our race. For sure, we need to improve our pace and do everything we can to move forward. We head straight to Miami now: it is a very different track from this, we will stay motivated and go for it again.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Zhou Guanyu, DNF</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Quite the weekend to forget for us: it&#8217;s never nice to DNF, but realistically we didn&#8217;t have a chance to score points today. We needed to retire the car as a precaution as we had rising temperatures and alarms on my dash. In general, it was a tough weekend for all of us. We need to understand the reasons for this and work hard, all of us, to make a step forward. I am confident this team can do that, I see it in the people here and at home. We will do all in our power to get back where we expect to be and continue to improve.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Alessandro Alunni Bravi, Team Representative</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;This was a disappointing race and it showed that, right now, our package is not competitive enough to score points. The priority for everyone of us in the team &#8211; here at the track and back at base &#8211; is to work hard and make the improvements necessary to get back where we expect to be. The field remains tight, and we can get back into this battle: but we must deliver a step forward to do so. We are all fully committed to this and we&#8217;re going to do whatever it takes to get there.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Zhou Guanyu of China and Alfa Romeo F1 talks with Valtteri Bottas of\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari comes in for a pitstop during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

As we fully expected, nearly all the drivers chose an opening stint on the P Zero Yellow medium before moving onto the P Zero White hard: only the drivers who started from the pit lane &#8211; Alpine&#8217;s Esteban Ocon and Haas driver Nico Hulkenberg &#8211; or those at the back of the grid like AlphaTauri&#8217;s Nyck De Vries, chose to start with a long stint on the hard tyre before going onto soft in the hope of a safety car during the closing stages. With very little long run data to fall back on, which was mainly collected during yesterday&#8217;s Sprint, there were a few more unknowns than usual heading into today&#8217;s grand prix. We&#8217;re pleased that the hard tyre not only showed a good level of reliability, with some runs of 300 kilometres on it, but that it also allowed drivers to push as hard as they liked. Proof of this came from the spectacular exchange of fastest laps among the top four, all from different teams, which additionally underlines the versatility of this compound. The fact that the best time among them (1m44.232s from Verstappen) was 1.8 seconds faster than last year&#8217;s fastest race lap is significant. The medium, which everyone had a bit more information on compared to the hard, showed performance in line with expectations but suffered from less graining, probably thanks also to the extra grip offered by the new asphalt.\"</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.facts-and-stats-red-bull-take-25th-one-two-as-perez-makes-it-five-street.1NNXwQKTk3DIIxlvsQrg4Q.html\">FACTS AND STATS: Red Bull take 25th one-two as Perez makes it five street wins in a row</a></strong></p>\n\n    </div>",

But with de Vries in the wall, the team opted to pit Verstappen. A lap later when the Safety Car came out, Perez was able to dive in and leapfrog his team mate. While the Mexican got lucky, from there he drove a superb race at a track he so often goes well at, and never seemed under undue pressure. Verstappen was struggling by contract with the balance of his RB19 and in the end had to settle for second.

Of course, I was a bit unlucky with the safety car call, but I think in that second stint both of us were pushing flat out. We used every centimetre on that track and touched a few walls! It was a good Team result and there were a lot of learnings from this weekend to take forward to the rest of the season. We bought it home and a 1-2 for the Team was ideal, Checo had a great race and did very well today. I\u2019m already looking forward to Miami and seeing what we can do there.\u201d Sergio Perez, 1st \u201cIt has been an unbelievable weekend, I am super pleased and I cannot say more about the Team, it has been a tremendous day for us and I am so proud of everyone. I want to say a big thanks to Thibaut, he is one of my mechanics who is at home for personal reasons, but he is still a very big part of our Team. The Team enjoy calling me the King of the Streets, I am super happy for them all. They have been tremendous all weekend, from the sprint race yesterday through to the way we executed the race today, it was perfect. I think today we were the fastest car on track and regardless of the safety car we would have won the race. I am definitely in the fight for the title, not just because of Baku, I believe I can be very good anywhere this season and now I am just thinking of Miami. There are a lot of races coming up and we must make sure we are on it.\u201d Christian Horner, Team Principal \u201cCheco absolutely excelled today. He had the pace and really controlled the race, he benefitted from the timing of the safety car but it was a phenomenal performance from him today and all weekend. Hats off to him. We were unlucky with the safety car and the pit stop for Max. Sometimes things like that don\u2019t go your way but that is racing and we will learn from it. Other than that it was an excellent performance from the whole team, another 1-2, our 25th! Things are clicking for us at the moment and it sets us up well for next week but it is still early days, there are 19 races and 5 more sprint races in this long season. With each race comes moments to savour but just as many learnings, we take those and move to the next challenge, preparation for Miami is already well under way, see you at the beach!\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 3 BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Race winner Sergio Perez of Mexico and Oracle Red Bull Racing celebrates with teammates in parc ferme during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

From there, he had a lonely race in third but at least scored his first podium of the season.

We maximised every session throughout the weekend and couldn't have done anything differently, so that\u2019s something to be happy about and the team did a great job. The bottom line is that we have to focus on race pace and tyre management and push to make even more progress in the coming races.\" Carlos Sainz, 5th \"This has been a very difficult weekend. P5 brings home some points but I must put my hand up and admit I lacked confidence under braking and the pace was not there. On the Medium tyre I could push a bit more, but with the harder compound I simply didn\u2019t feel the car. Now I look forward to a reset, as Miami is just around the corner and I can\u2019t wait to jump in the car again and keep pushing.\" Fred Vasseur, Team Principal \"Overall, this has been a positive weekend for the team. We took two pole positions and one podium finish with Charles and our overall points total, thanks also to Carlos\u2019 fifth place, is satisfactory. There were signs of progress in Melbourne, but they were overshadowed by the poor race result. In the four week break, we worked hard in Maranello and here in Baku we have made further progress which translated into a good result. \"We definitely are back to where we wanted to be in terms of qualifying, but there\u2019s still a significant gap to Red Bull in the race. However, we aim to fight them for the win and we are gearing up to do just that. It\u2019s a morale booster for the whole team to finish on the podium, something which we will carry forward as we prepare for next weekend\u2019s race in Miami.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Third placed Charles Leclerc of Monaco and Ferrari celebrates on the podium during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

He was finding the afternoon\u2019s running easy enough to spend much of the day chatting to his engineer about his set up, and suggesting improvements that could be utilised by his team mate behind. Speaking of, things seem pretty harmonious at Aston Martin with Stroll saying he wouldn\u2019t attack when the duo were running line astern, while Alonso said he was perfectly happy if he tried a move. READ MORE: 'Ferrari were quite lucky' declares Alonso as he narrowly misses out on podium finish at Azerbaijan GP Fernando Alonso, 4th \u201cI think we had a tricky weekend with the DRS issue on Friday and Saturday, but despite this we have finished only one second away from the podium at the chequered flag. With that in mind, I have to be happy with fourth position and our overall performance which was encouraging all race. Thankfully today the DRS seemed to work fine, and our tyre management was strong. I thought the tailwind was quite random and here in Baku you are always on the edge. We only have to wait a few days before we go racing again, so let\u2019s see what we can do next week in Miami!\u201d Lance Stroll, 7th \u201cIt was pretty tough out there today. I was happy with my start, as well as the Safety Car restart, but I wasn\u2019t feeling super comfortable with the car once the race got going and made a slight mistake. A little misjudgement can end your day here, so I was fortunate to get away with brushing the wall and managed to continue with the race. Once Lewis [Hamilton] passed me, it was just about maintaining position and holding off George [Russell] for the remaining laps. He was pushing hard, but we managed the tyres well and I was able to keep him behind me. As a team, we definitely have a few things to work though ahead of Miami, but I think we need to be pleased to come away from the first Sprint weekend of the year with a decent haul of points to maintain second in the Constructors\u2019 Championship.\u201d Mike Krack, Team Principal \u201cAnother well-executed weekend by the entire team and we leave Baku with a combined total of 22 points. That is a good return from quite a challenging event on a very demanding street circuit. Full credit to the drivers who did an excellent job to make progress from their starting positions. They managed the Hard tyres well over a long stint, while maintaining good race pace, and brought the cars home safely to round off a clean weekend. This sets us up nicely for our first trip of the year to the United States next week as we get ready to entertain the fans in Miami.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W14 leads Fernando Alonso of Spain driving the (14) Aston Martin AMR23 Mercedes on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

As such his team mate actually jumped him, but Russell had a poor restart and was helpless to fight off his team mate on track as Hamilton streamed past. From there, Hamilton also picked off Stroll but ran out of time to make it past Sainz, while Russell was left with a free pit stop late on which he used to grab the bonus point for fastest lap. Lewis Hamilton, 6th \"The timing of the Safety Car wasn't ideal! I couldn't get bogged down in that frustration though. I had to keep my head down and get focused on attacking. That's what I did, and I got right back in the race. I really enjoyed those battles with the cars around me. The Ferrari of Sainz was just a little bit quicker on the straight than us, even with the DRS open. I gave it everything I had to get past though. \"I'm continuously proud of my team. We didn't have the pace that we did in Melbourne, which is not the greatest, but there is no lack of motivation in this team. We're all super hungry, and hopefully this is the beginning of something better in the coming races. Once I get that confidence in the car, the pace will come.\" George Russell, 8th \"I'm a little bit disappointed with myself today. I made a really good start and got in a decent position. I made a good move on Stroll to get past him into the pit lane but I then made a mess of the restart. I was defending from Lance and almost ran into the back of Fernando (Alonso). I then ran wide and got my tyres dirty. Ultimately that's why both Lance and Lewis got past. From there, it was line astern. \"I'll take the extra point for fastest lap but the only reason we had that opportunity was because we were in a bad position. It was close pace-wise between ourselves, Ferrari and Aston Martin and small differences can make a big change in terms of results. Whether we finish P4 or P8 though, it's far from first so we've got a lot of work to do.\" Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport \"Today was not a thriller. There was very little overtaking even with a big pace difference. We headed into a sub optimum set-up direction during FP1 and by the time we realised it was too late, and the car was in parc ferm\u00e9 conditions. It's the same for everyone though under this format. \"The pace in free air today looked similar between ourselves, the Ferraris and the Aston Martins. It was hard to tell who was ultimately quicker though, because with the difficulty of overtaking you are stuck where you are stuck. The Red Bulls meanwhile sailed away into the sunset on merit. If we can get the platform right though, I think we can close that gap this year. It's not about adding points of downforce, more giving the drivers a car that they have confidence in.\" Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director \"We're never going to get excited about sixth and eighth place, but it was a day where the car wasn't particularly quick and neither driver had much luck during the race. Lewis had a decent opening lap; he'd started to get a bit of pressure from Alonso towards the end of the stint, so we came in to protect the position. Unfortunately, that was the lap before the Safety Car, so he lost out. A good restart helped the recovery, but he just couldn't get past Sainz. \"George had a really good opening lap, getting through some key cars early on. He was able to take the stop under the Safety Car but then struggled on the restart and lost a couple of places. Similarly to Lewis, he just couldn't make a pass despite having a bit more pace so our only consolation was a point for fastest lap at the end. We haven't got long to wait before we are bringing some more performance to the car and in the meantime, we just need to focus on collecting as many points as possible. We're hoping the car will be a bit better suited to the track in Miami and looking forward to being able to get back on track in just a few days.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W14 comes in for a pitstop during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

Piastri had a tougher afternoon, contact with Albon at the start stalling his progress.

It was as good a result as I was going to get and the best we could achieve today. P9 really doesn\u2019t sound like a lot but it was the best we can do at the moment. We got a bit unlucky with the Safety Car happening just after we had pit. I then got stuck behind Hulkenberg, but we got a couple of points on the board, which is a solid result, plus we got some good things out of the new parts we bought to track. So, I\u2019m happy with that and we\u2019ll try to improve again in Miami.\u201d Oscar Piastri, 11th \u201cIt was a shame to miss out on points by one spot, but we were just lacking a bit of pace in the middle of the race, so there wasn\u2019t really much more we could do. I\u2019m happy I survived the weekend after being unwell and we\u2019ve got some really good learning in the bank. I certainly learned a lot about the tyres in that race, and how to manage them better, so all of that will help us fight for points next time. Thanks to the team here and back at the factory for getting the upgrades out to us, it's definitely helped. We go again in Miami.\u201d Andrea Stella, Team Principal \u201cAn interesting weekend in Azerbaijan with the new Sprint format. Our main objective for the weekend remained preparing for the race: this was where the most points were available. The top four teams are a little bit ahead at the moment, so the mission was to be at the head of the midfield. We achieved that thanks to the upgrades we fitted this weekend. Thanks go to the team back at the factory and at track for helping us bring these parts to the car. Over the next few races, we will be able to verify how much of that is a genuine improvement, and how much was track-specific. \u201cLando, once again, was rock solid. Another clean weekend brings us a couple of very useful points. We were highly impressed with Oscar too.

I am happy to be racing again next week so I forget this weekend as soon as possible.\u201d Yuki Tsunoda, 10th \u201cIt was a tough race today but the team, especially the mechanics, did a great job to repair the car after yesterday. The engineers found a strong set-up, even if we lost some time in sector two. We didn\u2019t get many chances to do long runs this weekend but to be able to demonstrate a strong pace, and build on this performance throughout the race, was awesome from the team. I am also happy with my performance. I was consistent, and being sandwiched between the two McLarens meant any mistake would cost us the point. It took a lot of concentration but in the end, we were able to achieve another top-ten finish. There is still room for development and improvement to fight for points consistently, but I have confidence in my team to race stronger in the future.\u201d Franz Tost, Team Principal \u201cFirstly, congratulations to Red Bull Racing for another front-row finish. As for our weekend, we came to this race with some aero updates, and I\u2019m pleased to say they seem to work very well. The team in Bicester did a fantastic job because we have been competitive from the very beginning of the weekend. The highlight was of course Friday\u2019s qualifying, where Yuki finished in eighth position. As for today\u2019s race, he was overtaken by Stroll and Russell on the first lap, but this is what I expected as their cars are simply faster than ours. Nevertheless, Yuki did a fantastic job. He was able to split the McLarens, staying quite close to Norris and keeping Piastri behind. Overall, a big congratulations to Yuki for another strong performance, which shows how much he is improving race by race. Unfortunately, Nyck had an accident, he touched the wall in turn 5, breaking the front left track rod, and that was the end of his race. Generally speaking, we have improved the car performance dramatically since the start of the season, so now I am even more looking forward to the next race in Miami.\u201d Guillaume Dezoteux, Head of Vehicle Performance \u201cWe are very happy to end the weekend with a point. Yuki drove a solid race, the strategy calls were right and the pit stop was competitive. At the start of the race, we knew it would be difficult to hold faster cars behind us, but Yuki remained focused, made no mistakes and settled in a train of cars with both McLarens, a Haas and an Alpine. We were continuously evaluating safety car scenarios and monitoring other cars to react, although in the end, there was nothing to react to. Nyck's race started well with an offset strategy. We decided to start on the hard tyre, chasing any opportunity to make ground through the pack. Unfortunately, he made contact with the inside of Turn 5 and broke his front left track rod, which forced him to stop on track. Overall, this weekend has been solid and the track layout has suited us better. There are similarities in Miami, so we will review everything in the next couple of days to prepare as best we can for next weekend.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04 on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

His car was okay to continue, but he spent most of the race stuck in a DRS train and unable to make progress. The same could be said for Sargeant, who pitted under the Safety Car but didn\u2019t have the pace to really fight those around him. Better races to come from Williams, who need to find a way to convert their one-lap pace into race advantage. HIGHLIGHTS: Watch as Sergio Perez wins the 2023 Azerbaijan Grand Prix Logan Sargeant, 16th \"All things considered I learned a lot this weekend. In the race today, we got a bit unlucky with the safety car timing at the start and fell into a bit of a lonely, frustrating race. I was stuck behind Zhou for most of it. By the time he pitted it was just too late and I was too far disconnected from the pack ahead. However, when I did get in front, the car felt good, I was driving well, and the pace was not too bad at the end. I brought a set of hard tyres a long way and that\u2019s all positive. \"Our one lap pace this weekend was good, and I was happy considering we only had one free practice session to go into qualifying and have a pretty good one. It was going to be an even better Sprint Shootout until the crash, so I\u2019ll learn from that and move forward. The race wasn\u2019t bad, it just fell out of our hands and was a lonely, boring one for most people.\" Alex Albon, 12th \"It was really tough out there today. I had some damage on my front wing for most of the race following contact with the McLaren, so there was a lot of management to do. It was tricky trying to keep the Haas behind me whilst staying close to Oscar, and not a lot of room for overtaking with the shortened DRS zones. We really did maximise this weekend and I think it was personally one of my strongest, especially coming off Australia. I think we definitely have more to find with the car, but I think I\u2019m becoming at one with it, so hopefully we can keep this going.\" Dave Robson, Head of Vehicle Performance \"Alex suffered some front wing damage on the opening lap, which hurt the car balance and cost him downforce. Despite this he was able to put together another very strong race; he dealt with the pressure from Gasly and Magnussen brilliantly whilst also staying close to Piastri ahead. The timing of the early safety car was unfortunate for our strategy, but that is the nature of racing at Baku. Having missed the sprint race yesterday, Logan started the Grand Prix somewhat on the back foot but still put together a strong drive to fight with Zhou and Gasly. His pace and car management were competitive and gave him some very valuable learning for the future. \"We arrived in Baku for this new style sprint event expecting it to be a challenge. Although we rose to that challenge well and were able to put together a strong performance overall, it is frustrating not to get some points for our effort. Nonetheless, we head to Miami with some positive momentum and another good opportunity to challenge the top 10.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 1 BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Alexander Albon of Thailand driving the (23) Williams FW45 Mercedes leads Pierre Gasly of France driving the (10) Alpine F1 A523 Renault on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan. (Photo by Francois Nel/Getty Images) Info Close\n\nHaas Magnussen\u2019s bad luck continued, as he suffered front wing damage after running out of room at the start and colliding with Bottas. He tried hard from there on in, but wasn\u2019t able to climb back into the points. Hulkenberg had started from the pit lane and went for a very long first stint in the hopes a late Safety Car would offer him a free pit stop, but his tyres went off the cliff and he dropped back through the field. Nico Hulkenberg, 17th \"It was hard work \u2013 I was head-down, focused. It was a quali race to be honest for me, that was all I had but it was okay for 40 laps or so and then at the end, unfortunately the tyres started to drop quite rapidly. The Safety Car didn\u2019t come out and that\u2019s what we needed with the strategy we pursued. Nevertheless, it was good learning. We elected for a pit lane start and changed the set up completely to something more conventional. We learned something, on the positive side, and now onto Miami where I think we\u2019ll be more competitive.\" Kevin Magnussen, 13th \"We were stuck in traffic the whole race, we had pace for much more but just couldn\u2019t pass. Unfortunately, with the wing we have it\u2019s really fast with no DRS but with DRS it doesn\u2019t really have a big impact. Overtaking is very difficult, defending is pretty good because without DRS we\u2019re pretty fast. That little detail made the difference today because I think looking at the cars ahead I was way quicker than them but just couldn\u2019t get past. A bit of the same story as last year as we were in the points until the end but this year, we had even more pace. Hopefully that carries onto Miami, and we will try again.\" Guenther Steiner, Team Principal \"Kevin got his front wing endplate knocked off at the start because Bottas in front of him locked up, so he couldn\u2019t avoid him, and it was severe enough to make a front wing change. With Nico, we tried a different strategy and it didn\u2019t work because the Safety Car came too early. All in all, the performance of the car was good and we could hold pace with the Alpine and McLaren. I think we just have to take this one as a little dip and come back in Miami, where maybe for our car it\u2019s even better, being a medium-downforce circuit.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Kevin Magnussen of Denmark and Haas F1 looks on on the grid prior to the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

(Photo by Francois Nel/Getty Images) Info Close\n\nAlpine Alpine\u2019s difficult weekend continued on Sunday. Gasly pitted very early to get onto the hard compound, but as such lost out when the Safety Car came out. He pitted again, one of the few to try a two-stop strategy which wasn\u2019t the quickest way to the flag. As for Ocon, he climbed into the top 10 after starting in the pit lane on the hard tyres, and pitted on the very last lap as he desperately tried to hang on for a second Safety Car, which never came. Esteban Ocon, 15th \u201cWe gave it everything we could today, going for the Hail Mary strategy in the hope for a late Safety Car or incident, but things did not go our way. We can be proud with our efforts, pushing all the way to the end and extracting the most from the Hard tyres. I had a bit of a scary moment at the end of the race when I came into pit and saw people congregating in the Pit Lane even though the race had not ended. Fortunately, nothing happened, but we must make sure these scenarios don\u2019t happen again. We were not where we want to be in terms of performance this weekend. And, after a weekend of learning, we have a chance to review and comeback stronger in Miami. I know we will do just that.\u201d Pierre Gasly, 14th \u201cThis is a weekend all of us are keen to quickly move on from as it\u2019s been a very frustrating one for all of us at the team. We have to make sure this kind of performance is not repeated again. Clearly, it is not where we should be and we need to come back stronger for Miami next week on a more conventional track. In terms of my race, we tried something different on strategy and hoped for some fortune, but in the end, we couldn\u2019t do much more. I made a couple of moves, that\u2019s always satisfying, but it\u2019s much more rewarding when those overtakes are for points. I\u2019m looking forward to racing in Miami next weekend.\u201d Otmar Szafnauer, Team Principal \u201cIt\u2019s been a bitterly disappointing weekend for the team in Baku and we must not repeat this type of performance again. We very much started on the backfoot on Friday and since then we were not able to make any kind of recovery in any of the sessions. We were quite far off on car set-up on Friday during practice and with such limited running \u2013 notably with some reliability issues on both cars \u2013 we left ourselves with a mountain to climb for the remainder of the weekend. We must limit these problems going forward and begin all Grand Prix weekends on the front-foot to make sure we give ourselves the best possible chance on Saturday and Sunday to score points. We demonstrated our race pace in Australia and we have a better chance to validate our upgrade package in Miami. We must keep working hard as a team, keep up our understanding of how to maximise the most from our package and target a much-improved overall team performance next weekend Stateside.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Pierre Gasly of France driving the (10) Alpine F1 A523 Renault on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

Bottas collided with Magnussen at the start which dropped him back through the field, and from there struggled more than most with tyre wear. He pitted three times in the end on his way to last place. At least he saw the chequered flag though \u2013 Zhou was called in to the pits midway through to retire the car with technical issues. Valtteri Bottas, 18th \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a great race for us and we were never in the mix for the points: we need to understand what happened and, most importantly, how to get back to being competitive. My race was hard from the start: I had a contact in turn two, I was on the outside and I was hit from the left and from behind, which left me with some damage. It was quite a long race after that: we tried to find a way back in, as anything can happen here, but eventually there weren\u2019t any chances for us to rebuild our race. For sure, we need to improve our pace and do everything we can to move forward. We head straight to Miami now: it is a very different track from this, we will stay motivated and go for it again.\u201d Zhou Guanyu, DNF \u201cQuite the weekend to forget for us: it\u2019s never nice to DNF, but realistically we didn\u2019t have a chance to score points today. We needed to retire the car as a precaution as we had rising temperatures and alarms on my dash. In general, it was a tough weekend for all of us. We need to understand the reasons for this and work hard, all of us, to make a step forward. I am confident this team can do that, I see it in the people here and at home. We will do all in our power to get back where we expect to be and continue to improve.\u201d Alessandro Alunni Bravi, Team Representative \u201cThis was a disappointing race and it showed that, right now, our package is not competitive enough to score points. The priority for everyone of us in the team \u2013 here at the track and back at base \u2013 is to work hard and make the improvements necessary to get back where we expect to be. The field remains tight, and we can get back into this battle: but we must deliver a step forward to do so. We are all fully committed to this and we\u2019re going to do whatever it takes to get there.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - APRIL 30: Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari comes in for a pitstop during the F1 Grand Prix of Azerbaijan at Baku City Circuit on April 30, 2023 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

We need to make sure we get on top of the tyres and put them in the window at the right time to get the perfect lap around here.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MONTE-CARLO, MONACO - MAY 26: Sergio Perez of Mexico driving the (11) Oracle Red Bull Racing RB19\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MONTE-CARLO, MONACO - MAY 26: Max Verstappen of the Netherlands driving the (1) Oracle Red Bull\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MONTE-CARLO, MONACO - MAY 26: Sergio Perez of Mexico driving the (11) Oracle Red Bull Racing RB19 on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Monaco at Circuit de Monaco on May 26, 2023 in Monte-Carlo, Monaco.

His session from there was fairly serene, but the same couldn&#8217;t be said for Leclerc who locked up and ran wide as he struggled to put a clean lap together. The situation was reversed in FP2 though, with Sainz starting strongly but winding up in the barriers after hitting the barriers again &#8211; this time much more heavily. Leclerc, though, found his stride late on to push Verstappen hard and is right in the mix for tomorrow.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.leclerc-hopeful-of-fighting-for-hat-trick-of-monaco-poles-as-sainz-stresses.1ROv4pEVR5sXhgdND5GLd9.html\"><strong>READ MORE: Leclerc hopeful of fighting for hat-trick of Monaco poles as Sainz stresses FP2 crash &#8216;won&#8217;t affect&#8217; his confidence</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Charles Leclerc - FP1: 1:14.093, P5; FP2: 1:12.527, P2</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a bit of a difficult day as the car is not doing exactly what it is supposed to do.

Obviously, it was not ideal to finish the session in that way, after a small miscalculation trying to find the limit.

It was important to find a rhythm early this weekend and avoid any issues. In both sessions the car felt good and it&#8217;s easy to drive which helps at this circuit. There are going to be lots of ups and downs for everybody this year, so we have to be ready to deliver every weekend.

The AMR23 is working well around here &#8211; it&#8217;s definitely behaving itself &#8211; so tonight we&#8217;ll focus on tweaking a few, final things.

Hamilton seemed comfortable from the off and topped the timing sheets for much of the first session, but Russell wasn&#8217;t so confident as he struggled with both tyre warm up and brake temperatures. They dropped back slightly once the soft tyres were bolted on, and with so many strong cars this year, will have to find something special for tomorrow if they want a slot right at the front.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.hamilton-hails-amazing-day-in-monaco-as-mercedes-get-first-glimpse-of.TDJkklQhZJHtehWvbB7En.html\">READ MORE: Hamilton hails &#8216;amazing day&#8217; in Monaco as Mercedes get first glimpse of upgraded W14 out on track</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Lewis Hamilton &#8211; FP1: 1:14.035, P3; FP2: 1:12.960, P6</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had an amazing day and I really enjoyed driving out there. I want to send a big thank you to everyone at the factories. To build, design and develop a car is not an easy thing. Everyone&#8217;s put in so many hours of hard work to get us here. We got a lot of data today; it&#8217;s not a place to ultimately test an upgrade but the car was generally feeling good. It&#8217;s a shame we weren&#8217;t as close as I&#8217;d hoped at the end of the last session, but I felt some improvements. We&#8217;ve got to keep chipping away at it and see if we can squeeze some more juice out of the car.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>George Russell - FP1: 1:15.066, P15; FP2: 1:13.191, P12</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Monaco is such a unique track so it&#8217;s not an ideal place to be evaluating updates, but we knew that coming into the weekend. We&#8217;re just trying to focus on improving around this circuit and qualifying is obviously the most important part of the weekend. We generally do better on Sundays and struggle more on Saturday, so we need to try and flip that here. There were positive signs to take from today&#8217;s sessions but it&#8217;s never easy around this place. We made a lot of changes throughout the day, and the car felt improved in FP2. We&#8217;ll work hard tonight to see what we can do tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had a busy day but ran decent programmes with both cars and managed to cram in plenty of set-up compares along the way. It&#8217;s difficult to evaluate the update at this track from a lap-time point of view, but from what we can see it&#8217;s all working as expected. George seemed to have a better afternoon session which is good news as he was lacking confidence in FP1. Lewis has been pretty happy with the car all day but there are a few things we may have done for the second session that cost a bit of pace. We&#8217;ll look at that overnight. We&#8217;ve also got a good programme running in the simulator to try and find a bit more performance; hopefully we can find a step as even a tenth-of-a-second can be a big difference in qualifying here.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MONTE-CARLO, MONACO - MAY 26: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MONTE-CARLO, MONACO - MAY 26: George Russell of Great Britain driving the (63) Mercedes AMG\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MONTE-CARLO, MONACO - MAY 26: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W14 on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Monaco at Circuit de Monaco on May 26, 2023 in Monte-Carlo, Monaco.

Awesome to be back in the car here in Monaco. Feels insane, as always. Good fun out there and got comfortable very quickly, which is always important here. We made a few changes from FP1 to FP2, which were in the right direction, and we definitely got a bit more out of the car, so we&#8217;ll continue to try to explore that direction, see if we can improve a little bit more into tomorrow. A decent Friday, and I&#8217;m probably feeling a little bit more comfortable than I have been the last few weeks.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Oscar Piastri - FP1: 1:15.192, P17; FP2: 1:13.673, P18</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;First day in Monaco in an F1 car. It was a bit of a tricky day, it&#8217;s such a challenging circuit and I&#8217;ve got a bit of work to do on my side, but that&#8217;s what happens when you&#8217;re getting up to speed. I think I&#8217;ve got the best out of each corner at least once, I&#8217;ve just got to put them all together on a lap now. We&#8217;ll keep working overnight and see what we can do. The car looks to be in a reasonable place, but the field is so tight again, so small improvements can have a big impact. We&#8217;ll keep pushing and look to unlock more pace tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Andrea Stella, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had a decent first day of running in Monaco, despite a couple of issues on Lando&#8217;s side which ate into his track time in FP2 and high fuel laps. That aside, we worked through our programme as planned. Lando found a good rhythm relatively soon at low fuel. Oscar, making his first visit to Monaco in an F1 car, was rightly learning more and more run after run.

Both drivers kept their heads down and managed a good haul of laps, with Ocon the pick of the duo in FP1 and Gasly just shading his team mate in FP2. But with so many teams looking strong here, Alpine might need their drivers at their very best if they are to book slots in the top 10 come qualifying.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.need-to-know-the-most-important-facts-stats-and-trivia-ahead-of-the-2023-monaco.4IQmQbTxbx7CsTx6A7f4qV.html\"><strong>NEED TO KNOW: The most important facts, stats and trivia ahead of the 2023 Monaco Grand Prix</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Esteban Ocon - FP1: 1:14.585, P8; FP2: 1:13.162, P10</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Driving here in Monaco is a very special experience; there&#8217;s really no place like it. On our side, I think it&#8217;s been a smooth day, where we&#8217;ve run through our programme, tried a few different things and, importantly, did not take any unnecessary risks. I think we have a few more things to go through and test to be really up to speed and ready for qualifying tomorrow, so I&#8217;m sure Free Practice 3, for everybody, will be important. The car feels good, and we&#8217;re in a strong place looking ahead to the rest of the weekend.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Pierre Gasly - FP1: 1:14.866, P14; FP2: 1:13.089, P9</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s always great to be here in Monaco and driving around this iconic Formula 1 circuit. It&#8217;s been a reasonably solid day for us with some upgrades on the car and it was good to build up an understanding on those and, in general, ease ourselves into the weekend. The car felt much improved between Free Practice 1 and Free Practice 2, so I&#8217;m happy with our work today and we&#8217;re in decent shape looking ahead to the rest of the weekend. Tomorrow is qualifying day, an exciting experience at this place, and we&#8217;ll be giving it our best to be up there on the grid.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Matt Harman, Technical Director</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been good to have a smooth Practice day today where we&#8217;ve been able to assess some new upgrades on the car including the new sidepod, which is a very good step from the previous version. It&#8217;s been equally important not to face any issues on Friday &#8211; just like in Miami &#8211; for us to learn and validate our new parts as well as gearing up for the rest of the weekend. Both drivers have been sharp today, bringing their speed and confidence up around this tough track in a sensible manner. We&#8217;ll keep looking to make improvements on set-up to be well placed ahead of tomorrow&#8217;s important Qualifying session.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MONTE-CARLO, MONACO - MAY 26: Pierre Gasly of France driving the (10) Alpine F1 A523 Renault on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MONTE-CARLO, MONACO - MAY 26: Esteban Ocon of France driving the (31) Alpine F1 A523 Renault on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MONTE-CARLO, MONACO - MAY 26: Pierre Gasly of France driving the (10) Alpine F1 A523 Renault on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Monaco at Circuit de Monaco on May 26, 2023 in Monte-Carlo, Monaco.

Once the soft tyres went on, the Finn came alive and wound up solidly in the top 10. He might be hard pushed to stay there tomorrow, but he can&#8217;t be ruled out. Zhou was slightly further back on Friday, and will need to analyse the data to work out why.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.formula-why-the-reasons-why-street-tracks-are-the-ultimate-challenge-for-f1.b6qkM1QgRRT2R25kX9C23.html\"><strong>FORMULA WHY: The reasons why street tracks are the ultimate challenge for F1 drivers</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Valtteri Bottas - FP1: 1:14.718, P11; FP2: 1:13.050, P8</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a good, productive day and it was what we needed to finally test our new upgrades. I could feel a difference already, a positive one, even though we will have to do some work to refine the package and extract the most from it. It&#8217;s a promising sign, though, especially since the field is so tight and a small improvement can make a big difference. Overall, it was an interesting day: the track kept improving with every lap and, as always in Monaco, so did my confidence. Traffic is always an issue here but today we were able to navigate through it well. Now we need to focus on qualifying: the feeling is positive, if we can improve a little bit more overnight, we can be there or thereabout.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Zhou Guanyu - FP1: 1:15.684, P19; FP2: 1:13.354, P13</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;In general, a promising day for us. FP1 wasn&#8217;t the smoothest session and it was difficult to find a rhythm, but the later session was a step up for us. The first impressions from the upgrade package are positive, although it&#8217;s still early days, and I feel there is still a bit of margin, both for myself and the car, to further improve to be ready for tomorrow. We seem to be able to carry on from where we left off in Miami, and I&#8217;m looking forward to qualifying. We also looked solid in the long runs, so if we manage to translate today&#8217;s work into a good qualifying position, we can fight for the points. Tomorrow will be tricky &#8211; it always is here &#8211; but we can be in the mix for a good result.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MONTE-CARLO, MONACO - MAY 26: Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MONTE-CARLO, MONACO - MAY 26: Zhou Guanyu of China driving the (24) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MONTE-CARLO, MONACO - MAY 26: Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Monaco at Circuit de Monaco on May 26, 2023 in Monte-Carlo, Monaco.

He managed to slowly crawl back to the pits and didn&#8217;t seem to have done too much damage to the floor or the rear diffuser in the process. He was straight out in FP2 to make up for lost time, and may fancy his chances given so far this season, his prowess has been mostly on Saturdays. Magnussen had a quieter time of it bar one excursion down at Sainte Devote.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.paddock-insider-monaco-is-one-of-f1s-great-challenges-and-its-where-red.49GOcgBuwqAhhr6Eeieajo.html\"><strong>PADDOCK INSIDER: Monaco is one of F1&#8217;s great challenges &#8211; and it&#8217;s where Red Bull&#8217;s rivals will feel they are beatable</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Nico Hulkenberg - FP1: 1:15.785, P20; FP2: 1:13.520, P15</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was good fun but challenging at the same time. It&#8217;s mega fast around here now and it&#8217;s the first time I drive this new generation of car around Monaco, and I have to say it&#8217;s probably the fastest thing I&#8217;ve driven around here and it&#8217;s only Friday, so there&#8217;s more to come. In terms of running, it wasn&#8217;t ideal in FP1 with the little kiss coming out of the tunnel. FP2 was okay, we collected a lot of data, and we have some new parts on the car that we need to analyse and see what else we can find.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Magnussen &#8211; FP1: 1:14.725, P12; FP2: 1:13.457, P14</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a decent day and it looked good in FP1, we lost a little bit in FP2 I think with the changes we made to the car. It&#8217;s very bumpy out there for us in the low-speed, not like the typical high-speed porpoising stuff but just dealing with the bumps at the apex of the corners. It&#8217;s Monaco and everything is tight together and you only need to find a little bit then you move up a lot, so it&#8217;s still all to play for tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Guenther Steiner, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t a perfect day, not bad, but we learned a lot. We need to get a bit further up to qualify well because that defines the race weekend here, so we still have some work in front of us, but everyone knows what we need to do and we&#8217;ll try to achieve it for FP3. All in all, not a bad day except for the little incident from Nico but it wasn&#8217;t bad. We need to work a little bit on the set-up of the car so that the drivers feel a bit more comfortable in it.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MONTE-CARLO, MONACO - MAY 26: Nico Hulkenberg of Germany driving the (27) Haas F1 VF-23 Ferrari\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MONTE-CARLO, MONACO - MAY 26: Kevin Magnussen of Denmark driving the (20) Haas F1 VF-23 Ferrari on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MONTE-CARLO, MONACO - MAY 26: Nico Hulkenberg of Germany driving the (27) Haas F1 VF-23 Ferrari with a broken rear wheel after a crash during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Monaco at Circuit de Monaco on May 26, 2023 in Monte-Carlo, Monaco.

But then Albon crashed, losing the rear into the first corner and connecting with the walls to bring out the red flags. The team managed to repair his car and he did come out in FP2, but he lost a lot of running and will be up against it in FP3 to try and regain his confidence.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.destination-guide-what-fans-can-eat-see-and-do-when-they-visit-monaco-for.6mir8BF2few8KzFlgAQZjM.html\"><strong>DESTINATION GUIDE: What fans can eat, see and do when they visit Monaco for the Grand Prix</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Logan Sargeant - FP1: 1:15.557, P18; FP2: 1:14.238, P20</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;The first day here in Monaco is done and it&#8217;s always a privilege to drive this track. We&#8217;re not exactly where we want to be and we&#8217;re missing some pace but, from a driving standpoint, I think I was driving well and that&#8217;s a positive to take. We&#8217;ll look to see how we can improve the car for tomorrow and we go again.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Alex Albon - FP1: 1:14.666, P10; FP2: 1:14.217, P19</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a great job from the team to get the car ready for FP2, despite being a bit compromised in that session. We need to take a look tonight to see if we can improve the car, however it is tricky out there, but I think it&#8217;s tricky for everyone. It feels like it always does around Monaco, like you&#8217;re on a knife edge but that&#8217;s because you&#8217;re always on the limit. Ultimately, I think we need to find a few more tenths to fight for Q2 but we&#8217;ll try do that.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Dave Robson, Head of Vehicle Performance</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Today was a bit mixed with Alex showing some decent pace in FP1 but then damaging the car at the end of the session. Until that point, he was making steady progress and we were investigating the new parts on the car. Although his team did an excellent job to get the car ready for FP2, there wasn&#8217;t enough of the session left for Alex to really understand the evening conditions and the soft qualifying tyre. If we can recover to the pace we had in FP1 then we can still mount a useful challenge in qualifying.

He kept the sessions clean and progressed his learning and understanding of the set-up throughout the day.

I raced here in Formula 2 and Formula E, but coming here as the main series is definitely different. I think it was a solid Friday, in which we made progress throughout both of the sessions. We are slowly chipping away and getting more comfortable with the car on track, but there is still some work to do for the balance. The Monaco track isn&#8217;t an aerodynamic-sensitive track, so we will need to find more performance elsewhere from the new upgrades. We&#8217;ll do our homework tonight and we will need to keep it clean tomorrow when there will be a lot of cars on track during Q1, so getting a lap together will be challenging.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Yuki Tsunoda - FP1: 1:14.820, P13; FP2: 1:13.641, P16</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I enjoyed driving around Monaco, but there is still some pace to be found for qualifying, and we have to focus on this as it&#8217;s going to be really important. We have quite a few big upgrades on the car this weekend, but it&#8217;s hard to say how well they work because Monaco isn&#8217;t an aero-efficient track. As usual, we will put it together tonight so we can make it through to Q2 tomorrow, as Q3 seems a bit difficult, but let&#8217;s see.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Jonathan Eddolls, Chief Race Engineer</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Having missed the Emilia Romagna GP last week, it&#8217;s been three weeks since the drivers had been on track, so coming here to a tricky track, it was a case of building up the pace lap by lap. We carried over the new aero package that was\nplanned to be introduced in the last event, but it&#8217;s always very difficult to draw conclusions at Monaco. So far, there seem to be no surprises, so both cars will retain this for the rest of the weekend.</p>\n<p>&#8220;FP1 was mainly focused on the drivers and covering the most laps possible to get them used to the car at this track. The balance was quite close already from the beginning, which means it was just a case of tracking the changing track conditions throughout the day. We made a further step in improving the balance for FP2, but it&#8217;s clear there is still more that we can do for tomorrow, so we will continue to work on the set-up overnight to tackle the main weaknesses. Yuki&#8217;s session ended prematurely after just brushing the apex barrier at Turn 10 and damaging the rims, so he missed out on his long run, but at least this won&#8217;t have a big impact on his qualifying preparation for tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MONTE-CARLO, MONACO - MAY 26: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04 on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MONTE-CARLO, MONACO - MAY 26: Nyck de Vries of Netherlands and Scuderia AlphaTauri prepares to\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MONTE-CARLO, MONACO - MAY 26: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04 on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Monaco at Circuit de Monaco on May 26, 2023 in Monte-Carlo, Monaco.

In terms of tyre behavior, we had no particular surprises. All three compounds were used on a track that sped up significantly from the beginning to the end of today&#8217;s running. The differences in performance between hard, medium and soft are quite in line with the simulations and, in their evaluation, one must take into account the relatively short length of this circuit and its evolution.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.watch-ride-onboard-with-max-verstappen-on-his-way-to-the-fastest-lap-of-day.cweYeCoDeZ8mdjuin0YBk.html\"><strong>WATCH: Ride onboard with Max Verstappen on his way to the fastest lap of day one running in Monaco</strong></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Usually the gaps here are small, but this year they seem to be even smaller, because in the hybrid era we have never seen a gap of only seven-tenths between the first and 10th-fastest drivers in FP2. It will therefore be even more important to be on track at the right moment to be able to push hard and, with this in mind, it is worth pointing out that today we saw that even the softest compound allows for more than one fast lap if properly managed in terms of grip recovery. It is a tyre characteristic that we introduced last year and which has already been highlighted recently at other circuits, such as Baku.&#8221;</p>\n\n    </div>",

The situation was reversed in FP2 though, with Sainz starting strongly but winding up in the barriers after hitting the barriers again \u2013 this time much more heavily.

We got a lot of data today; it\u2019s not a place to ultimately test an upgrade but the car was generally feeling good. It\u2019s a shame we weren\u2019t as close as I\u2019d hoped at the end of the last session, but I felt some improvements. We\u2019ve got to keep chipping away at it and see if we can squeeze some more juice out of the car.\u201d George Russell - FP1: 1:15.066, P15; FP2: 1:13.191, P12 \u201cMonaco is such a unique track so it\u2019s not an ideal place to be evaluating updates, but we knew that coming into the weekend. We\u2019re just trying to focus on improving around this circuit and qualifying is obviously the most important part of the weekend. We generally do better on Sundays and struggle more on Saturday, so we need to try and flip that here. There were positive signs to take from today\u2019s sessions but it\u2019s never easy around this place. We made a lot of changes throughout the day, and the car felt improved in FP2. We\u2019ll work hard tonight to see what we can do tomorrow.\u201d Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director \u201cWe\u2019ve had a busy day but ran decent programmes with both cars and managed to cram in plenty of set-up compares along the way. It\u2019s difficult to evaluate the update at this track from a lap-time point of view, but from what we can see it\u2019s all working as expected. George seemed to have a better afternoon session which is good news as he was lacking confidence in FP1. Lewis has been pretty happy with the car all day but there are a few things we may have done for the second session that cost a bit of pace. We\u2019ll look at that overnight. We\u2019ve also got a good programme running in the simulator to try and find a bit more performance; hopefully we can find a step as even a tenth-of-a-second can be a big difference in qualifying here.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 MONTE-CARLO, MONACO - MAY 26: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W14 on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Monaco at Circuit de Monaco on May 26, 2023 in Monte-Carlo, Monaco.

Awesome to be back in the car here in Monaco. Feels insane, as always. Good fun out there and got comfortable very quickly, which is always important here. We made a few changes from FP1 to FP2, which were in the right direction, and we definitely got a bit more out of the car, so we\u2019ll continue to try to explore that direction, see if we can improve a little bit more into tomorrow. A decent Friday, and I\u2019m probably feeling a little bit more comfortable than I have been the last few weeks.\u201d Oscar Piastri - FP1: 1:15.192, P17; FP2: 1:13.673, P18 \u201cFirst day in Monaco in an F1 car. It was a bit of a tricky day, it\u2019s such a challenging circuit and I\u2019ve got a bit of work to do on my side, but that\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re getting up to speed. I think I\u2019ve got the best out of each corner at least once, I\u2019ve just got to put them all together on a lap now. We\u2019ll keep working overnight and see what we can do. The car looks to be in a reasonable place, but the field is so tight again, so small improvements can have a big impact. We\u2019ll keep pushing and look to unlock more pace tomorrow.\u201d Andrea Stella, Team Principal \u201cWe\u2019ve had a decent first day of running in Monaco, despite a couple of issues on Lando\u2019s side which ate into his track time in FP2 and high fuel laps. That aside, we worked through our programme as planned. Lando found a good rhythm relatively soon at low fuel. Oscar, making his first visit to Monaco in an F1 car, was rightly learning more and more run after run. From here, we\u2019ll do all the usual Monaco things: keep optimising all the details with the drivers and on the car, do our best to execute our plan smoothly and put good laps together for qualifying and the race.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 MONTE-CARLO, MONACO - MAY 26: Lando Norris of Great Britain driving the (4) McLaren MCL60 Mercedes on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Monaco at Circuit de Monaco on May 26, 2023 in Monte-Carlo, Monaco.

Both drivers kept their heads down and managed a good haul of laps, with Ocon the pick of the duo in FP1 and Gasly just shading his team mate in FP2. But with so many teams looking strong here, Alpine might need their drivers at their very best if they are to book slots in the top 10 come qualifying. NEED TO KNOW: The most important facts, stats and trivia ahead of the 2023 Monaco Grand Prix Esteban Ocon - FP1: 1:14.585, P8; FP2: 1:13.162, P10 \u201cDriving here in Monaco is a very special experience; there\u2019s really no place like it. On our side, I think it\u2019s been a smooth day, where we\u2019ve run through our programme, tried a few different things and, importantly, did not take any unnecessary risks. I think we have a few more things to go through and test to be really up to speed and ready for qualifying tomorrow, so I\u2019m sure Free Practice 3, for everybody, will be important. The car feels good, and we\u2019re in a strong place looking ahead to the rest of the weekend.\u201d Pierre Gasly - FP1: 1:14.866, P14; FP2: 1:13.089, P9 \u201cIt\u2019s always great to be here in Monaco and driving around this iconic Formula 1 circuit. It\u2019s been a reasonably solid day for us with some upgrades on the car and it was good to build up an understanding on those and, in general, ease ourselves into the weekend. The car felt much improved between Free Practice 1 and Free Practice 2, so I\u2019m happy with our work today and we\u2019re in decent shape looking ahead to the rest of the weekend. Tomorrow is qualifying day, an exciting experience at this place, and we\u2019ll be giving it our best to be up there on the grid.\u201d Matt Harman, Technical Director \u201cIt\u2019s been good to have a smooth Practice day today where we\u2019ve been able to assess some new upgrades on the car including the new sidepod, which is a very good step from the previous version. It\u2019s been equally important not to face any issues on Friday \u2013 just like in Miami \u2013 for us to learn and validate our new parts as well as gearing up for the rest of the weekend. Both drivers have been sharp today, bringing their speed and confidence up around this tough track in a sensible manner. We\u2019ll keep looking to make improvements on set-up to be well placed ahead of tomorrow\u2019s important Qualifying session.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 MONTE-CARLO, MONACO - MAY 26: Pierre Gasly of France driving the (10) Alpine F1 A523 Renault on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Monaco at Circuit de Monaco on May 26, 2023 in Monte-Carlo, Monaco.

Once the soft tyres went on, the Finn came alive and wound up solidly in the top 10. He might be hard pushed to stay there tomorrow, but he can\u2019t be ruled out. Zhou was slightly further back on Friday, and will need to analyse the data to work out why. FORMULA WHY: The reasons why street tracks are the ultimate challenge for F1 drivers Valtteri Bottas - FP1: 1:14.718, P11; FP2: 1:13.050, P8 \u201cIt was a good, productive day and it was what we needed to finally test our new upgrades. I could feel a difference already, a positive one, even though we will have to do some work to refine the package and extract the most from it. It\u2019s a promising sign, though, especially since the field is so tight and a small improvement can make a big difference. Overall, it was an interesting day: the track kept improving with every lap and, as always in Monaco, so did my confidence. Traffic is always an issue here but today we were able to navigate through it well. Now we need to focus on qualifying: the feeling is positive, if we can improve a little bit more overnight, we can be there or thereabout.\u201d Zhou Guanyu - FP1: 1:15.684, P19; FP2: 1:13.354, P13 \u201cIn general, a promising day for us. FP1 wasn\u2019t the smoothest session and it was difficult to find a rhythm, but the later session was a step up for us. The first impressions from the upgrade package are positive, although it\u2019s still early days, and I feel there is still a bit of margin, both for myself and the car, to further improve to be ready for tomorrow. We seem to be able to carry on from where we left off in Miami, and I\u2019m looking forward to qualifying. We also looked solid in the long runs, so if we manage to translate today\u2019s work into a good qualifying position, we can fight for the points. Tomorrow will be tricky \u2013 it always is here \u2013 but we can be in the mix for a good result.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 MONTE-CARLO, MONACO - MAY 26: Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Monaco at Circuit de Monaco on May 26, 2023 in Monte-Carlo, Monaco.

He managed to slowly crawl back to the pits and didn\u2019t seem to have done too much damage to the floor or the rear diffuser in the process. He was straight out in FP2 to make up for lost time, and may fancy his chances given so far this season, his prowess has been mostly on Saturdays. Magnussen had a quieter time of it bar one excursion down at Sainte Devote. PADDOCK INSIDER: Monaco is one of F1\u2019s great challenges \u2013 and it\u2019s where Red Bull\u2019s rivals will feel they are beatable Nico Hulkenberg - FP1: 1:15.785, P20; FP2: 1:13.520, P15 \u201cIt was good fun but challenging at the same time. It\u2019s mega fast around here now and it\u2019s the first time I drive this new generation of car around Monaco, and I have to say it\u2019s probably the fastest thing I\u2019ve driven around here and it\u2019s only Friday, so there\u2019s more to come. In terms of running, it wasn\u2019t ideal in FP1 with the little kiss coming out of the tunnel. FP2 was okay, we collected a lot of data, and we have some new parts on the car that we need to analyse and see what else we can find.\u201d Kevin Magnussen \u2013 FP1: 1:14.725, P12; FP2: 1:13.457, P14 \u201cIt was a decent day and it looked good in FP1, we lost a little bit in FP2 I think with the changes we made to the car. It\u2019s very bumpy out there for us in the low-speed, not like the typical high-speed porpoising stuff but just dealing with the bumps at the apex of the corners. It\u2019s Monaco and everything is tight together and you only need to find a little bit then you move up a lot, so it\u2019s still all to play for tomorrow.\u201d Guenther Steiner, Team Principal \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a perfect day, not bad, but we learned a lot. We need to get a bit further up to qualify well because that defines the race weekend here, so we still have some work in front of us, but everyone knows what we need to do and we\u2019ll try to achieve it for FP3. All in all, not a bad day except for the little incident from Nico but it wasn\u2019t bad. We need to work a little bit on the set-up of the car so that the drivers feel a bit more comfortable in it.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 MONTE-CARLO, MONACO - MAY 26: Nico Hulkenberg of Germany driving the (27) Haas F1 VF-23 Ferrari with a broken rear wheel after a crash during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Monaco at Circuit de Monaco on May 26, 2023 in Monte-Carlo, Monaco.

First, Sargeant had to limp back to the pits with an issue, which the team managed to sort and get him back out on track. But then Albon crashed, losing the rear into the first corner and connecting with the walls to bring out the red flags. The team managed to repair his car and he did come out in FP2, but he lost a lot of running and will be up against it in FP3 to try and regain his confidence. DESTINATION GUIDE: What fans can eat, see and do when they visit Monaco for the Grand Prix Logan Sargeant - FP1: 1:15.557, P18; FP2: 1:14.238, P20 \u201cThe first day here in Monaco is done and it\u2019s always a privilege to drive this track. We\u2019re not exactly where we want to be and we\u2019re missing some pace but, from a driving standpoint, I think I was driving well and that\u2019s a positive to take. We\u2019ll look to see how we can improve the car for tomorrow and we go again.\u201d Alex Albon - FP1: 1:14.666, P10; FP2: 1:14.217, P19 \u201cIt was a great job from the team to get the car ready for FP2, despite being a bit compromised in that session. We need to take a look tonight to see if we can improve the car, however it is tricky out there, but I think it\u2019s tricky for everyone. It feels like it always does around Monaco, like you\u2019re on a knife edge but that\u2019s because you\u2019re always on the limit. Ultimately, I think we need to find a few more tenths to fight for Q2 but we\u2019ll try do that.\u201d Dave Robson, Head of Vehicle Performance \u201cToday was a bit mixed with Alex showing some decent pace in FP1 but then damaging the car at the end of the session. Until that point, he was making steady progress and we were investigating the new parts on the car. Although his team did an excellent job to get the car ready for FP2, there wasn\u2019t enough of the session left for Alex to really understand the evening conditions and the soft qualifying tyre. If we can recover to the pace we had in FP1 then we can still mount a useful challenge in qualifying. However, missing much of a session in Monaco is very costly and we will need to work hard overnight and through FP3 to make up for the lost time. \u201cLogan drove well throughout the day; although he has driven here before, tackling the streets of Monte Carlo in an F1 car is a different challenge. He kept the sessions clean and progressed his learning and understanding of the set-up throughout the day. His pace was a little bit off where he wanted it to be, but with a little bit more work tonight, he can have a strong day tomorrow and build on his solid start to the weekend.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 MONTE-CARLO, MONACO - MAY 26: Alexander Albon of Thailand driving the (23) Williams FW45 Mercedes on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Monaco at Circuit de Monaco on May 26, 2023 in Monte-Carlo, Monaco.

(Photo by Ryan Pierse/Getty Images) Info Close\n\nAlphaTauri Tsunoda was unsurprisingly vocal about some of the traffic issues that everyone faced in practice, and later managed to clip the barriers in FP2. That led to a rear puncture and cost him the rest of the session. De Vries had a quieter day but did manage two mistake-free sessions, which was a good start for the rookie here, as he seeks to out-qualify his team mate for the second straight race. F1 TRACKS: Check out The Chainsmokers\u2019 amazing playlist and exclusive Q&A ahead of the Monaco Grand Prix Nyck de Vries - FP1: 1:15.083, P16; FP2: 1:13.663, P17 \u201cI\u2019m enjoying this track. I raced here in Formula 2 and Formula E, but coming here as the main series is definitely different. I think it was a solid Friday, in which we made progress throughout both of the sessions. We are slowly chipping away and getting more comfortable with the car on track, but there is still some work to do for the balance. The Monaco track isn\u2019t an aerodynamic-sensitive track, so we will need to find more performance elsewhere from the new upgrades. We\u2019ll do our homework tonight and we will need to keep it clean tomorrow when there will be a lot of cars on track during Q1, so getting a lap together will be challenging.\u201d Yuki Tsunoda - FP1: 1:14.820, P13; FP2: 1:13.641, P16 \u201cI enjoyed driving around Monaco, but there is still some pace to be found for qualifying, and we have to focus on this as it\u2019s going to be really important. We have quite a few big upgrades on the car this weekend, but it\u2019s hard to say how well they work because Monaco isn\u2019t an aero-efficient track. As usual, we will put it together tonight so we can make it through to Q2 tomorrow, as Q3 seems a bit difficult, but let\u2019s see.\u201d Jonathan Eddolls, Chief Race Engineer \u201cHaving missed the Emilia Romagna GP last week, it\u2019s been three weeks since the drivers had been on track, so coming here to a tricky track, it was a case of building up the pace lap by lap. We carried over the new aero package that was planned to be introduced in the last event, but it\u2019s always very difficult to draw conclusions at Monaco. So far, there seem to be no surprises, so both cars will retain this for the rest of the weekend. \u201cFP1 was mainly focused on the drivers and covering the most laps possible to get them used to the car at this track. The balance was quite close already from the beginning, which means it was just a case of tracking the changing track conditions throughout the day. We made a further step in improving the balance for FP2, but it\u2019s clear there is still more that we can do for tomorrow, so we will continue to work on the set-up overnight to tackle the main weaknesses. Yuki\u2019s session ended prematurely after just brushing the apex barrier at Turn 10 and damaging the rims, so he missed out on his long run, but at least this won\u2019t have a big impact on his qualifying preparation for tomorrow.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 MONTE-CARLO, MONACO - MAY 26: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04 on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Monaco at Circuit de Monaco on May 26, 2023 in Monte-Carlo, Monaco.

He didn&#8217;t pit under the first Safety Car but Russell did, so the Dutchman found himself after the first red flag in second and on fresh tyres was able to easily pick off Hamilton. He led from there on in, although he did run wide at one point after locking up when comfortably ahead. As for Perez, the early red flag looked to have scuppered his plan to start on the hards and run long, but he was able to extract plenty of pace from his car to climb through the field after starting in the pit lane.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.verstappen-very-happy-with-maiden-australian-gp-win-but-says-rules-were-not.5WCX2KErDRaBxiT3FZsGRX.html\">READ MORE: Verstappen &#8216;very happy&#8217; with maiden Australian GP win &#8211; but says rules were &#8216;not followed&#8217; in Lap 1 Hamilton tussle</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Max Verstappen, 1st</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;My start today wasn&#8217;t amazing and then on lap 1 I was very careful as there was a lot on the line, I had a lot to lose and a lot to win. But after that restart, we had good pace and a decent gap for the majority of the race. Perhaps we didn&#8217;t need all of those red flags today, it was frustrating, but everyone was safe and we won which is the most important thing. It&#8217;s my first win in Australia which feels really good, it&#8217;s also been a while for the Team so it means a lot to us all, especially as Checo also had a good recovery drive today. It&#8217;s been a chaotic day but it&#8217;s great to see that the fans had a great time despite the long wait!&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Sergio Perez, 5th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Generally, it was a good result today. Yesterday, I obviously lost a bit of confidence with the car, but we made a lot of changes overnight so that helped heading into the race. I had a really good restart the first time, I jumped 3 or 4 places but then it was a bit of a mess with the DRS train. I was frustrated later in the race because I couldn&#8217;t advance any further, but it was so difficult to get through the field with tyre deg low and everyone going on to the hard tyres quickly. Maybe if I&#8217;d been a bit more aggressive earlier on, I could&#8217;ve finished higher, but I&#8217;m happy we finished P5 and even managed to secure the fastest lap. Overall, this race gives us confidence heading to Baku in a few weeks and we look forward to the challenge that it brings.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Christian Horner, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a complicated race made up of three parts. The first start didn&#8217;t go our way but in the restart Max was able to hold position, battle Lewis for the lead and really control the race from there. While the marshals are always acting in the interest of safety, and driver safety is paramount, the restart at the end of the race was a little frustrating. Thankfully, it didn&#8217;t cost us anything, we had great pace with the car and Max was on great form. For Max to claim the victory was testament to his driving, but equally, credit must go to the Team both here and at home, all of whom worked together to deliver a great race. Checo also drove phenomenally well, bringing home the fastest lap and securing P5 in the end. It was a great recovery, from the back of the grid, in the pits, on a track where it is very difficult to overtake. All in all we are very happy with our performance and thrilled to bring home a win on our 350th race at a track we haven&#8217;t won at in 10 years.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Race winner Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle Red Bull\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Sergio Perez of Mexico driving the (11) Oracle Red Bull Racing\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Race winner Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle Red Bull Racing celebrates on the podium during the F1 Grand Prix of Australia at Albert Park Grand Prix Circuit on April 02, 2023 in Melbourne, Australia.

From there, Hamilton couldn&#8217;t keep Verstappen behind but did well to manage his tyres to the finish to keep Alonso at bay for a brilliant second place. Russell was scything his way back through the field before <a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.its-just-such-a-shame-says-mercedes-russell-after-retiring-with-power-unit.1BhfnePPs7NbkXPJg5yOc1.html\">flames erupted from the back of his PU</a>, ending his race early.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.hamilton-hails-amazing-podium-as-he-says-mercedes-closing-gap-to-red-bull.flGxtJoNz03v1TSkr7Mfw.html\">READ MORE: Hamilton hails &#8216;amazing&#8217; Melbourne podium as he says Mercedes closing gap to Red Bull will be &#8216;tough but not impossible&#8217;</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Lewis Hamilton, 2nd</strong></p>\n<p>\"To get a podium today is amazing; I definitely didn't expect to be second this weekend, so I am super grateful. Considering we're down on performance, to be fighting with the Aston Martins is amazing for us at this point in the season. We've just got to keep fighting. A big thank you to all the people back at the factory. We can close that gap; it's going to be tough but not impossible.</p>\n<p>\"It was very unlucky for George today. Our reliability has generally been pretty good so that was unfortunate. Finally, I want to say a huge thank you to everyone here in Melbourne and Australia. I've had the best week here and this town continues to put on a great show.\"</p>\n<p><strong>George Russell, DNF</strong></p>\n<p>\"We did everything right this weekend. We had a great Qualifying yesterday and today, the start was perfect. We managed the first stint well and I could have extended it quite a lot more. I've felt comfortable and strong in the car on all three days. I see no reason why we couldn't have fought for victory today, so it's disappointing. As soon as I came through the high-speed turn 10, I felt something go. Three corners later, I was stopped. When it's not your day, it's not your day.</p>\n<p>\"We've still got a lot of work to do to catch Red Bull, but we can take the positives from this weekend. Every time we've taken to the track, we couldn't have done any more. We maximised everything and I'm proud of the job that we have done.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport</strong></p>\n<p>\"We had strong pace today and it was really close with the Aston Martins and the Ferraris. That is good news for us, and I think we have made a step forward this weekend, both on one-lap and race pace. We maximised what we have, and we need to now comb through the data and continue to learn about the car. This will help bring the upgrade packages and that will be the key in challenging the leaders more often.</p>\n<p>\"It was unfortunate with George; he had a great stop from the lead and changed onto the hard tyre. It was absolutely the right call, and he would have been very much at the front. With the red flag his race was not so good anymore. He still could have made it to the front though, so he was unfortunate to have a Power Unit failure.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director</strong></p>\n<p>\"It's great to get the first podium of the year with Lewis, but it was a day of mixed fortunes for the team. Lewis drove a difficult race well and had to find a fine balance between tyre management and defending. George had put together a strong weekend and was unfortunate that the Safety Car became a red flag. Things then got worse with the Power Unit issue. The pace of the car has been better than at the first two races; we've made some changes to the setup for the circuit but hopefully we can take some of that learning into the upcoming races.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Second placed Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain and Mercedes\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"Mercedes' British driver George Russell walks back to the pits after his car caught fire during the\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Second placed Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain and Mercedes celebrates on the podium during the F1 Grand Prix of Australia at Albert Park Grand Prix Circuit on April 02, 2023 in Melbourne, Australia.

Both were able to pick up a free tyre change at the first red flag stoppage which catapulted them up the order, with Alonso harrying Hamilton ahead for much of the race. But disaster struck at the third restart, as Alonso was tapped into a spin by Sainz before Stroll out-braked himself and disappeared into the gravel. That left them 11th and 12th and out of the points with one lap to go, before Race Control decided to revert to the order of the final restart.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.alonso-reflects-on-rollercoaster-of-emotions-race-as-he-takes-third-place-in.5bQQng17Q26YvI6uCHruLe.html\">READ MORE: Alonso reflects on 'rollercoaster of emotions' race as he takes third place in Melbourne</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Fernando Alonso, 3rd</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a rollercoaster of emotions today with the red flags and incidents. It was probably my craziest race here in Melbourne but it&#8217;s great to come away with another podium. There were many things going on all afternoon and we had an interesting battle with Lewis [Hamilton] for second. The pace of the car was good and we kept up the pressure on Lewis, but he did a good job and didn&#8217;t really make any mistakes. On the contact with Carlos [Sainz] after the restart I&#8217;m sure he didn&#8217;t mean to do it so I think the penalty for him was quite harsh in the end. We have to be pleased with this start to the season and three podiums in as many races.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Lance Stroll, 4th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I think we should be pleased with the result we&#8217;ve come away with today: third and fourth is great for the team. It was a heavily disrupted race with red flags and a few big accidents, and neither Fernando nor I managed to stay clear of the drama. I had a little bit of contact on the first lap, but we were running well until the first red flag was thrown. As we&#8217;ve seen across the weekend, it takes a while for the tyres to get up to temperature here and so on the second restart I locked up at turn three and ended up in the gravel. Thankfully, the red flag had been waved before that point and I was able to retake my position for the final restart. This sport is a rollercoaster of emotions sometimes! Overall, we&#8217;ve come away from a chaotic race with a solid haul of points for the team and to be second in the Constructors&#8217; Championship after three races is very positive&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Mike Krack, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;What a race! There was just about everything you could imagine this afternoon so to come away with third and fourth places &#8211; and 27 points &#8211; is a brilliant reward for the team. It was not an easy race to navigate with the early red flag putting extra emphasis on managing the Hard tyres. Almost everyone was trying to run until the end and it was very close throughout the top ten. Fernando stayed close to Lewis, but with similar race pace we could not get close enough to challenge for second. Lance raced hard all afternoon, survived various battles, and did an excellent job looking after the tyres. Then there was the chaotic restart and I have to say it was a relief to see the starting order reinstated. I know some drivers and teams really lost out in the mayhem, but we got a bit lucky with both cars being largely undamaged allowing us to finish the race under the Safety Car. Big congratulations and thanks to the whole team at Silverstone and here at the track for another strong and faultless performance with both cars and our third podium of the year. Today we celebrate and enjoy this result, but tomorrow our attention turns to the next race in Baku.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Third placed Fernando Alonso of Spain and Aston Martin F1 Team\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Lance Stroll of Canada driving the (18) Aston Martin AMR23\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Third placed Fernando Alonso of Spain and Aston Martin F1 Team celebrates on the podium during the F1 Grand Prix of Australia at Albert Park Grand Prix Circuit on April 02, 2023 in Melbourne, Australia.

We had good pace throughout, stayed out of trouble with no mistakes. The team did a very good job. I think the pace today was stronger than our qualifying pace yesterday, so things came together nicely. Just a well-executed race.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy with all of that, and it's the first points for us this season. It's nice to get on the board and it's a good end to the first few races before we have a bit of a break and then head into Baku and the next batch of races.

Double points for the team is a great result and thank you to everyone who got us there.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Andrea Stella, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;An eventful race today in Melbourne. We managed to stay out of trouble and were able to score our first points of the season. Even without the three red flags, it was good to see that we were in condition to race well and make good overtaking moves, so there&#8217;s plenty of positives. At the same time, we know we have to stay realistic and have a lot of hard work ahead. Both trackside and back at the factory, we&#8217;ll use the energy from this double points result to make us even more determined to deliver a quicker car.

He did stop after the chequered flag though, so will hope there aren't any enduring reliability concerns. It was a case of what might have been though, with the German finding himself fourth in the pit lane queue until Race Control decided to revert to the previous order.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.breaking-haas-protest-results-of-2023-australian-grand-prix.2VIj7H2Oe3V3AAPGESJOdd.html\">READ MORE: Haas protest provisional results of 2023 Australian Grand Prix</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Nico Hulkenberg, 7th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was wild and a bit messy at times. We&#8217;ll have to look through everything that happened as there were a lot of things happening. I had a super start the third time around on softs and came through to P4, so it&#8217;s a shame there were a few incidents and then the race was red flagged. There are a lot of positive learnings again and I feel there are a lot of good things happening. I&#8217;m refreshed, in a very positive mindset and really enjoy working with the team and experimenting with the car. We have very good momentum and that&#8217;s what we want to take into the next races.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Magnussen, DNF</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I brushed the wall at the exit of Turn 2 and the rim broke, the tire came off and I had to stop. I didn&#8217;t even feel it so it definitely wasn&#8217;t something that felt big in the car, but it was enough to crack the rim and take the tire off. It&#8217;s unfortunate, we were in P12 I think at that time and it didn&#8217;t look like I was going to be able to score points. We got unlucky with the first red flag as we had just pitted from P11 and we seemed to be quicker than the next couple of cars so I was quite confident at that stage of the race. Then we pitted under the safety car and just afterwards, it turned to a red flag. Everyone put their tires on to go to the end of the race and we were last. It wasn&#8217;t my day but it seemed like the car had decent pace so I&#8217;m encouraged by that and we&#8217;ll push next time.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Nico Hulkenberg of Germany driving the (27) Haas F1 VF-23 Ferrari\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Kevin Magnussen of Denmark and Haas F1 looks on from the drivers\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Nico Hulkenberg of Germany driving the (27) Haas F1 VF-23 Ferrari on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Australia at Albert Park Grand Prix Circuit on April 02, 2023 in Melbourne, Australia.

Zhou wasn&#8217;t too far further up, but as the chaos unfolded, both cars started to move up the order. They both managed to tiptoe through all the late carnage to find themselves in the top 10 &#8211; only for Race Control to revert the order, which left Zhou clinging on to one point, but left Bottas missing out in 11th.</p>\n<p><strong>Valtteri Bottas, 11th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy for Zhou and the team to come back with two points from what can only be described as a chaotic race. My afternoon had been quite lonely and without much action &#8211; until it all kicked off towards the end. We decided to take a risk at the start, and I pitted for hard tyres on lap one: the plan was to keep those tyres for the whole race, but then the red flag meant I couldn&#8217;t get much advantage from that. Later, when the safety car came out, we went for softs, but yet again the red flag messed up with my strategy. It&#8217;s been a hard weekend, we have been off the pace since the start, but we&#8217;ll make sure to look into that in the gap before the next race. I am actually glad to have some time before Baku, to get back to the drawing board and get back in a more competitive shape.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Zhou Guanyu, 10th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;P9 at the chequered flag is a good result, especially considering where we started and the challenging weekend we had. There are positives to take &#8211; we had a really good start, which is something we worked really hard on, and we didn&#8217;t do any mistakes in a race where there were plenty of spills. We kept it clean, kept out of trouble, and I was able to keep the pressure on Magnussen in the later stages, which in the end allowed us to get points. The conditions out there were difficult, the track temperatures were very low but we didn&#8217;t do mistakes and it is what matters. These are my first points of the year, always a nice reward in a tricky place like Melbourne. Now we will need to keep improving and hopefully add more points to our name in Baku and beyond.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Alessandro Alunni Bravi, Team Representative</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s race shows the importance of fighting until the very end of the race. We kept pushing, we executed the race well and we placed ourselves in the position to capitalise on the opportunities when they came our way: luck is only getting a chance, we had to seize it. We were actually quite unlucky with the timing of the first red flag: we had both cars on the right strategy to fight for the top ten, but the stoppage, and the free stop it gifted everyone else, effectively jeopardised our afternoon. Both Zhou and Valtteri had a solid race, without making mistakes, and on a track like this it meant they were there or thereabout at the chequered flag. Two points are a good return in what has been a challenging weekend: we need to make the most of this little break before Baku to understand how to recapture the pace we had in Bahrain, analyse the data from the car, especially with the new upgrades our team at home was able to produce for this race, and get back stronger for the next rounds.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Zhou Guanyu of China and Alfa Romeo F1 greets fans on the\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Zhou Guanyu of China and Alfa Romeo F1 greets fans on the Melbourne Walk prior to the F1 Grand Prix of Australia at Albert Park Grand Prix Circuit on April 02, 2023 in Melbourne, Australia.

Tsunoda had been struggling with an undisclosed car issue for much of the race, sinking like a stone in the early stages. But he found himself P11 yet again as the cars trundled out of the pit lane for the final time, only to be pushed up to 10th when Sainz&#8217;s penalty was applied &#8211; scoring AlphaTauri&#8217;s first point of the year.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.facts-and-stats-three-champs-on-top-in-first-ever-race-to-feature-three-red.59ScVtXDfrgJR8DwgnX40m.html\">FACTS AND STATS: Three champs on top in first-ever race to feature three red flags</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Nyck de Vries, DNF</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Sadly, the racing incident with Logan meant the end of the race for us. We were struggling very much out there today but we did well at the beginning on the hard compound. Unfortunately, when the red flag came out, everyone who started on the mediums got a free pitstop to switch to the hard. I also damaged the front wing during the race, so I ended up with understeer and graining on the tyres. The midfield is still very tight, so we will continue to work and push, to be able to move up the ladder.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Yuki Tsunoda, 10th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I have mixed feelings about today. We scored our first point of the season which is good, but to be honest, given our pace I didn&#8217;t expect to score any today. Considering how much we were struggling before the red flag, with warming up and getting the hard compound tyres in the optimum window, we should take this result and be happy with P10 as we maximised our performance. It's a shame we lost P5 because, going into Turn 1, I managed to overtake several cars. On the positive side we scored a point, so we will continue to work hard to score more in the coming races.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Jody Egginton, Technical Director</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a very difficult race for us. Both drivers pushed hard to extract all they could from the package, but we couldn't manage to get the cars moving forward as required. The pace of the car was not there on all compounds, and we struggled for straight-line speed, as such, we weren't able to attack nor hold position in some phases of the race. We leave Melbourne with a lot of data to go through and a lot of work ahead of us in order to be best prepared for Baku.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04 on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Nyck de Vries of Netherlands driving the (21) Scuderia AlphaTauri\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04 on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Australia at Albert Park Grand Prix Circuit on April 02, 2023 in Melbourne, Australia.

That left Sainz to fly the flag for the team. He climbed back through the field after unluckily stopping just before the first red flag, and looked to have pace to burn today. But at the second restart he tapped Alonso into a spin, which earned him a five second time penalty. With the race red flagged, and only one formation lap behind the Safety Car remaining, that time penalty dropped the distraught Spaniard from fourth to P12.</p>\n<p><strong>Charles Leclerc, DNF</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was unfortunate to end the race this way today, but it was a racing incident and I don&#8217;t think that we could have done anything differently. Disappointing, but on to the next one where I hope things will run more smoothly again.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Carlos Sainz, 12th</strong></p>\n<p>\"I had a good start and felt confident on the medium tyre but we were unlucky, pitting just before they brought out the first red flag and I dropped down to P11. From there I managed to pull off a good comeback with nice overtakes and solid pace, so for that I&#8217;m happy.</p>\n<p>\"It was a good race overall but the penalty ruined all the effort and I don&#8217;t agree with it. The frustration I feel right now will be difficult to digest, but I will try to think only of the positives from today and focus on the next race.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Fred Vasseur, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>\"Today&#8217;s result, not scoring points, does not reflect the progress we have made as a team. We have taken a step forward in terms of pure performance and even more importantly, we had a decent and consistent race pace on the various tyre compounds, including the Hard. Only yesterday&#8217;s qualifying did not match our potential.</p>\n<p>\"Our initial reaction is one of frustration, with Charles clearly unlucky to be involved in a racing incident at the start. It was a good call to bring Carlos in under the first Safety Car, but following the red flag, he had to start again from P11, from which he recovered very well. The penalty had a devastating effect on the final result for him but despite this, we go back to Maranello knowing that we are moving in the right direction and we now have three weeks to keep working on optimising and updating the SF-23 for the coming races.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Charles Leclerc of Monaco driving the (16) Ferrari SF-23 gets\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Charles Leclerc of Monaco and Ferrari walks from his car after\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Carlos Sainz of Spain driving (55) the Ferrari SF-23 on track\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">3</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Charles Leclerc of Monaco driving the (16) Ferrari SF-23 gets stuck in a gravel trap during the F1 Grand Prix of Australia at Albert Park Grand Prix Circuit on April 02, 2023 in Melbourne, Australia.

Gasly was having a brilliant race, running in fifth for much of the day and exhibiting great race pace in being able to stick with the Ferrari of Sainz and the Aston Martin of Alonso, whilst keeping Stroll behind. As for Ocon, he climbed up into P10 and looks assured of a point at least. But at the final restart, Gasly ran wide and hit his team mate as he returned to the track. That sent them both into the wall in what appeared to be a racing incident after which both were summoned to the Stewards.</p>\n<p><strong>Esteban Ocon, DNF</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a real shame for both cars not to finish today&#8217;s race, especially after showing great pace all weekend. We had the performance to be fighting the Ferraris and the Aston Martins, so to walk away with nothing is a tough one for all of us. The restart at the end was very chaotic and everything went so fast. The clash with Pierre was unfortunate and I&#8217;m glad we&#8217;re both OK. We&#8217;ve spoken about it, and we&#8217;re all good and there&#8217;s no hard feelings. We&#8217;re both already looking forward to the next one and I know the whole team will want to put this weekend behind us.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Pierre Gasly, DNF</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very disappointed in the outcome of today&#8217;s race. We were in fifth place for most of it, chasing Carlos [Sainz] for fourth place and we showed really good race pace. For us to be so close to scoring ten points and leaving without any is a bitter one for us to take. Right now, we must focus on the positives and that is how we managed our race and how we were able to take the fight to our rivals ahead. I&#8217;m glad both Esteban and I are OK after the incident. As a team, we&#8217;ll move on and keep focused for the next race.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Otmar Szafnauer, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;While it&#8217;s disappointing to leave here with zero points, we can be satisfied and positive with the performance of our car today. We showed we can race with our close rivals ahead and, indeed, close cars down and be clinical when it counts. Pierre drove very well today, running much of the race in fifth place and in the fight for a podium alongside the Mercedes, Aston Martin and Ferrari. We must take the positives of this and use it as motivation going forwards. Esteban was certainly unfortunate with the sequence of events early in the race, but he did a good job to climb his way back into the points with some well-judged overtaking moves. It was unfortunate to have both our cars come together at the third standing start and I&#8217;m glad both drivers are OK given the nature of the incident. We&#8217;ll keep moving forwards and these hard moments are what brings the team closer together. We&#8217;re already looking forward to Baku where an upgrade is planned.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Pierre Gasly of France driving the (10) Alpine F1 A523 Renault on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Esteban Ocon of France and Alpine F1 looks on from the grid during\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Pierre Gasly of France driving the (10) Alpine F1 A523 Renault on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Australia at Albert Park Grand Prix Circuit on April 02, 2023 in Melbourne, Australia.

But he spun off in the early stages under his own steam after losing the rear, bringing out first the Safety Car and then the first red flags due to gravel on the track. Sargeant was working hard from the back of the field, but he was one of very few to require another stop after those red flags which didn&#8217;t help his cause. At the second restart, he hit the back of the AlphaTauri of De Vries, which sent him off into the gravel and out of the race.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.must-see-williams-alex-albon-crashes-out-of-promising-sixth-place-in-the.5pU9MTNZpMNFyvIm9m35Z1.html\">MUST-SEE: Williams' Alex Albon crashes out of promising sixth place in the 2023 Australian Grand Prix and brings out red flags</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Logan Sargeant, DNF</strong></p>\n<p>\"The race in general just didn&#8217;t quite fall our way, with it being a really tricky day. We pitted to the medium tyre following the first safety car, and it just wasn&#8217;t the tyre to be on today and I really struggled with it. Once we got to the hard tyre, the pace wasn&#8217;t too bad, so to end it like that is unfortunate. We tried to take some chances today and it just didn&#8217;t pay off. I&#8217;ve learnt a lot from today, so hopefully can use these learnings going forward.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Alex Albon, DNF</strong></p>\n<p>\"We&#8217;re still looking at the data but there was nothing unusual in the corner itself. When I lost the car, I was going through slower than the previous lap; I went wide on the corner before and spiked the tyre temperatures, losing grip and going into the next corner a bit hot, so I think that&#8217;s what happened but we need to look at it. With all the accidents, it was a good chance to score points this weekend, so I&#8217;m very sorry to the team. I&#8217;m disappointed, as we had a great car today and were really strong.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Dave Robson, Head of Vehicle Performance</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was a remarkable race but ultimately it was a missed opportunity for us. Alex built on his excellent qualifying display to make more positions at the start and was looking good for a comfortable top ten finish.

All these occurrences effectively defined how the strategies shook out, while in terms of tyre behaviour, the compounds performed as we expected them to, with the hard C2 tyre playing a leading role. When the first safety car came out after Albon went off on lap seven, some drivers who had started on the mediums switched to the hard &#8211; followed by others once the red flag came out to allow the track to be cleaned. Despite not having much information over long runs &#8211; very few drivers strung together stints of longer than 10 laps or so in free practice &#8211; the C2 showed itself to be a very consistent tyre in terms of degradation and not far from the pace of other nominated compounds, fulfilling all the demands placed on it. The fact that we saw all three compounds on the starting grid highlights how bringing the C4 tyre to Melbourne this year was the correct choice, as it was judged to be a valid race tyre as well as becoming the protagonist of the final run to the flag, thanks to two red flag periods that were almost consecutive. Both this compound and the medium showed good performance today, albeit over relatively short stints, with higher temperatures and a more rubbered-in surface.\"</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.highlights-safety-cars-red-flags-and-high-drama-down-under-as-verstappen.3ECfPdB8IfSoD4SbwseLVM.html\">HIGHLIGHTS: Safety Cars, red flags and high drama Down Under as Verstappen wins in Australia</a></strong></p>\n\n    </div>",
            "text": "Red Bull Verstappen made a slow getaway and lost out to both Mercedes cars. He didn\u2019t pit under the first Safety Car but Russell did, so the Dutchman found himself after the first red flag in second and on fresh tyres was able to easily pick off Hamilton. He led from there on in, although he did run wide at one point after locking up when comfortably ahead. As for Perez, the early red flag looked to have scuppered his plan to start on the hards and run long, but he was able to extract plenty of pace from his car to climb through the field after starting in the pit lane. READ MORE: Verstappen \u2018very happy\u2019 with maiden Australian GP win \u2013 but says rules were \u2018not followed\u2019 in Lap 1 Hamilton tussle Max Verstappen, 1st \u201cMy start today wasn\u2019t amazing and then on lap 1 I was very careful as there was a lot on the line, I had a lot to lose and a lot to win. But after that restart, we had good pace and a decent gap for the majority of the race. Perhaps we didn\u2019t need all of those red flags today, it was frustrating, but everyone was safe and we won which is the most important thing. It\u2019s my first win in Australia which feels really good, it\u2019s also been a while for the Team so it means a lot to us all, especially as Checo also had a good recovery drive today. It\u2019s been a chaotic day but it\u2019s great to see that the fans had a great time despite the long wait!\u201d Sergio Perez, 5th \u201cGenerally, it was a good result today. Yesterday, I obviously lost a bit of confidence with the car, but we made a lot of changes overnight so that helped heading into the race. I had a really good restart the first time, I jumped 3 or 4 places but then it was a bit of a mess with the DRS train. I was frustrated later in the race because I couldn\u2019t advance any further, but it was so difficult to get through the field with tyre deg low and everyone going on to the hard tyres quickly. Maybe if I\u2019d been a bit more aggressive earlier on, I could\u2019ve finished higher, but I\u2019m happy we finished P5 and even managed to secure the fastest lap. Overall, this race gives us confidence heading to Baku in a few weeks and we look forward to the challenge that it brings.\u201d Christian Horner, Team Principal \u201cIt was a complicated race made up of three parts. The first start didn\u2019t go our way but in the restart Max was able to hold position, battle Lewis for the lead and really control the race from there. While the marshals are always acting in the interest of safety, and driver safety is paramount, the restart at the end of the race was a little frustrating. Thankfully, it didn\u2019t cost us anything, we had great pace with the car and Max was on great form. For Max to claim the victory was testament to his driving, but equally, credit must go to the Team both here and at home, all of whom worked together to deliver a great race. Checo also drove phenomenally well, bringing home the fastest lap and securing P5 in the end. It was a great recovery, from the back of the grid, in the pits, on a track where it is very difficult to overtake. All in all we are very happy with our performance and thrilled to bring home a win on our 350th race at a track we haven\u2019t won at in 10 years.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Race winner Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle Red Bull Racing celebrates on the podium during the F1 Grand Prix of Australia at Albert Park Grand Prix Circuit on April 02, 2023 in Melbourne, Australia.

Russell then pitted under the first Safety Car, before the red flags came out. That dropped him unluckily down the order and left Hamilton leading. From there, Hamilton couldn\u2019t keep Verstappen behind but did well to manage his tyres to the finish to keep Alonso at bay for a brilliant second place. Russell was scything his way back through the field before flames erupted from the back of his PU, ending his race early.

Considering we're down on performance, to be fighting with the Aston Martins is amazing for us at this point in the season. We've just got to keep fighting. A big thank you to all the people back at the factory. We can close that gap; it's going to be tough but not impossible. \"It was very unlucky for George today. Our reliability has generally been pretty good so that was unfortunate. Finally, I want to say a huge thank you to everyone here in Melbourne and Australia. I've had the best week here and this town continues to put on a great show.\" George Russell, DNF \"We did everything right this weekend. We had a great Qualifying yesterday and today, the start was perfect. We managed the first stint well and I could have extended it quite a lot more. I've felt comfortable and strong in the car on all three days. I see no reason why we couldn't have fought for victory today, so it's disappointing. As soon as I came through the high-speed turn 10, I felt something go. Three corners later, I was stopped. When it's not your day, it's not your day. \"We've still got a lot of work to do to catch Red Bull, but we can take the positives from this weekend. Every time we've taken to the track, we couldn't have done any more. We maximised everything and I'm proud of the job that we have done.\" Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport \"We had strong pace today and it was really close with the Aston Martins and the Ferraris. That is good news for us, and I think we have made a step forward this weekend, both on one-lap and race pace. We maximised what we have, and we need to now comb through the data and continue to learn about the car. This will help bring the upgrade packages and that will be the key in challenging the leaders more often. \"It was unfortunate with George; he had a great stop from the lead and changed onto the hard tyre. It was absolutely the right call, and he would have been very much at the front. With the red flag his race was not so good anymore. He still could have made it to the front though, so he was unfortunate to have a Power Unit failure.\" Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director \"It's great to get the first podium of the year with Lewis, but it was a day of mixed fortunes for the team. Lewis drove a difficult race well and had to find a fine balance between tyre management and defending. George had put together a strong weekend and was unfortunate that the Safety Car became a red flag. Things then got worse with the Power Unit issue. The pace of the car has been better than at the first two races; we've made some changes to the setup for the circuit but hopefully we can take some of that learning into the upcoming races.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Second placed Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain and Mercedes celebrates on the podium during the F1 Grand Prix of Australia at Albert Park Grand Prix Circuit on April 02, 2023 in Melbourne, Australia.

Both were able to pick up a free tyre change at the first red flag stoppage which catapulted them up the order, with Alonso harrying Hamilton ahead for much of the race. But disaster struck at the third restart, as Alonso was tapped into a spin by Sainz before Stroll out-braked himself and disappeared into the gravel. That left them 11th and 12th and out of the points with one lap to go, before Race Control decided to revert to the order of the final restart. READ MORE: Alonso reflects on 'rollercoaster of emotions' race as he takes third place in Melbourne Fernando Alonso, 3rd \u201cIt was a rollercoaster of emotions today with the red flags and incidents. It was probably my craziest race here in Melbourne but it\u2019s great to come away with another podium. There were many things going on all afternoon and we had an interesting battle with Lewis [Hamilton] for second. The pace of the car was good and we kept up the pressure on Lewis, but he did a good job and didn\u2019t really make any mistakes. On the contact with Carlos [Sainz] after the restart I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t mean to do it so I think the penalty for him was quite harsh in the end. We have to be pleased with this start to the season and three podiums in as many races.\u201d Lance Stroll, 4th \u201cI think we should be pleased with the result we\u2019ve come away with today: third and fourth is great for the team. It was a heavily disrupted race with red flags and a few big accidents, and neither Fernando nor I managed to stay clear of the drama. I had a little bit of contact on the first lap, but we were running well until the first red flag was thrown. As we\u2019ve seen across the weekend, it takes a while for the tyres to get up to temperature here and so on the second restart I locked up at turn three and ended up in the gravel. Thankfully, the red flag had been waved before that point and I was able to retake my position for the final restart. This sport is a rollercoaster of emotions sometimes! Overall, we\u2019ve come away from a chaotic race with a solid haul of points for the team and to be second in the Constructors\u2019 Championship after three races is very positive\u201d Mike Krack, Team Principal \u201cWhat a race! There was just about everything you could imagine this afternoon so to come away with third and fourth places \u2013 and 27 points \u2013 is a brilliant reward for the team. It was not an easy race to navigate with the early red flag putting extra emphasis on managing the Hard tyres. Almost everyone was trying to run until the end and it was very close throughout the top ten. Fernando stayed close to Lewis, but with similar race pace we could not get close enough to challenge for second. Lance raced hard all afternoon, survived various battles, and did an excellent job looking after the tyres. Then there was the chaotic restart and I have to say it was a relief to see the starting order reinstated. I know some drivers and teams really lost out in the mayhem, but we got a bit lucky with both cars being largely undamaged allowing us to finish the race under the Safety Car. Big congratulations and thanks to the whole team at Silverstone and here at the track for another strong and faultless performance with both cars and our third podium of the year. Today we celebrate and enjoy this result, but tomorrow our attention turns to the next race in Baku.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Third placed Fernando Alonso of Spain and Aston Martin F1 Team celebrates on the podium during the F1 Grand Prix of Australia at Albert Park Grand Prix Circuit on April 02, 2023 in Melbourne, Australia.

Norris was able to hold Perez at bay in the middle of the race, while Piastri had to get his elbows out to climb through the field. They were rewarded with points for both cars, keeping a calm head every bit as important today as tyre management in a race of attrition. Lando Norris, 6th \"A very good race. We had good pace throughout, stayed out of trouble with no mistakes. The team did a very good job. I think the pace today was stronger than our qualifying pace yesterday, so things came together nicely. Just a well-executed race. \u201cI\u2019m happy with all of that, and it's the first points for us this season. It's nice to get on the board and it's a good end to the first few races before we have a bit of a break and then head into Baku and the next batch of races.

I\u2019ll definitely take it. Obviously a crazy, crazy race but we stayed in there when it mattered. I\u2019m so happy to get my first points in Melbourne and want to thank all of the home fans and papaya fans for all their support this week. Double points for the team is a great result and thank you to everyone who got us there.\u201d Andrea Stella, Team Principal \u201cAn eventful race today in Melbourne. We managed to stay out of trouble and were able to score our first points of the season. Even without the three red flags, it was good to see that we were in condition to race well and make good overtaking moves, so there\u2019s plenty of positives. At the same time, we know we have to stay realistic and have a lot of hard work ahead. Both trackside and back at the factory, we\u2019ll use the energy from this double points result to make us even more determined to deliver a quicker car.

Hulkenberg though had been running in the points for all of the afternoon, and although he lost out to Perez and Norris, seventh was still a strong result and his first points of the season. He did stop after the chequered flag though, so will hope there aren't any enduring reliability concerns. It was a case of what might have been though, with the German finding himself fourth in the pit lane queue until Race Control decided to revert to the previous order. READ MORE: Haas protest provisional results of 2023 Australian Grand Prix Nico Hulkenberg, 7th \u201cIt was wild and a bit messy at times. We\u2019ll have to look through everything that happened as there were a lot of things happening. I had a super start the third time around on softs and came through to P4, so it\u2019s a shame there were a few incidents and then the race was red flagged. There are a lot of positive learnings again and I feel there are a lot of good things happening. I\u2019m refreshed, in a very positive mindset and really enjoy working with the team and experimenting with the car. We have very good momentum and that\u2019s what we want to take into the next races.\u201d Kevin Magnussen, DNF \u201cI brushed the wall at the exit of Turn 2 and the rim broke, the tire came off and I had to stop. I didn\u2019t even feel it so it definitely wasn\u2019t something that felt big in the car, but it was enough to crack the rim and take the tire off. It\u2019s unfortunate, we were in P12 I think at that time and it didn\u2019t look like I was going to be able to score points. We got unlucky with the first red flag as we had just pitted from P11 and we seemed to be quicker than the next couple of cars so I was quite confident at that stage of the race. Then we pitted under the safety car and just afterwards, it turned to a red flag. Everyone put their tires on to go to the end of the race and we were last. It wasn\u2019t my day but it seemed like the car had decent pace so I\u2019m encouraged by that and we\u2019ll push next time.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Nico Hulkenberg of Germany driving the (27) Haas F1 VF-23 Ferrari on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Australia at Albert Park Grand Prix Circuit on April 02, 2023 in Melbourne, Australia.

Zhou wasn\u2019t too far further up, but as the chaos unfolded, both cars started to move up the order. They both managed to tiptoe through all the late carnage to find themselves in the top 10 \u2013 only for Race Control to revert the order, which left Zhou clinging on to one point, but left Bottas missing out in 11th. Valtteri Bottas, 11th \u201cI\u2019m happy for Zhou and the team to come back with two points from what can only be described as a chaotic race. My afternoon had been quite lonely and without much action \u2013 until it all kicked off towards the end. We decided to take a risk at the start, and I pitted for hard tyres on lap one: the plan was to keep those tyres for the whole race, but then the red flag meant I couldn\u2019t get much advantage from that. Later, when the safety car came out, we went for softs, but yet again the red flag messed up with my strategy. It\u2019s been a hard weekend, we have been off the pace since the start, but we\u2019ll make sure to look into that in the gap before the next race. I am actually glad to have some time before Baku, to get back to the drawing board and get back in a more competitive shape.\u201d Zhou Guanyu, 10th \u201cP9 at the chequered flag is a good result, especially considering where we started and the challenging weekend we had. There are positives to take \u2013 we had a really good start, which is something we worked really hard on, and we didn\u2019t do any mistakes in a race where there were plenty of spills. We kept it clean, kept out of trouble, and I was able to keep the pressure on Magnussen in the later stages, which in the end allowed us to get points. The conditions out there were difficult, the track temperatures were very low but we didn\u2019t do mistakes and it is what matters. These are my first points of the year, always a nice reward in a tricky place like Melbourne. Now we will need to keep improving and hopefully add more points to our name in Baku and beyond.\u201d Alessandro Alunni Bravi, Team Representative \u201cToday\u2019s race shows the importance of fighting until the very end of the race. We kept pushing, we executed the race well and we placed ourselves in the position to capitalise on the opportunities when they came our way: luck is only getting a chance, we had to seize it. We were actually quite unlucky with the timing of the first red flag: we had both cars on the right strategy to fight for the top ten, but the stoppage, and the free stop it gifted everyone else, effectively jeopardised our afternoon. Both Zhou and Valtteri had a solid race, without making mistakes, and on a track like this it meant they were there or thereabout at the chequered flag. Two points are a good return in what has been a challenging weekend: we need to make the most of this little break before Baku to understand how to recapture the pace we had in Bahrain, analyse the data from the car, especially with the new upgrades our team at home was able to produce for this race, and get back stronger for the next rounds.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Zhou Guanyu of China and Alfa Romeo F1 greets fans on the Melbourne Walk prior to the F1 Grand Prix of Australia at Albert Park Grand Prix Circuit on April 02, 2023 in Melbourne, Australia.

Tsunoda had been struggling with an undisclosed car issue for much of the race, sinking like a stone in the early stages. But he found himself P11 yet again as the cars trundled out of the pit lane for the final time, only to be pushed up to 10th when Sainz\u2019s penalty was applied \u2013 scoring AlphaTauri\u2019s first point of the year. FACTS AND STATS: Three champs on top in first-ever race to feature three red flags Nyck de Vries, DNF \u201cSadly, the racing incident with Logan meant the end of the race for us. We were struggling very much out there today but we did well at the beginning on the hard compound. Unfortunately, when the red flag came out, everyone who started on the mediums got a free pitstop to switch to the hard. I also damaged the front wing during the race, so I ended up with understeer and graining on the tyres. The midfield is still very tight, so we will continue to work and push, to be able to move up the ladder.\u201d Yuki Tsunoda, 10th \u201cI have mixed feelings about today. We scored our first point of the season which is good, but to be honest, given our pace I didn\u2019t expect to score any today. Considering how much we were struggling before the red flag, with warming up and getting the hard compound tyres in the optimum window, we should take this result and be happy with P10 as we maximised our performance. It's a shame we lost P5 because, going into Turn 1, I managed to overtake several cars. On the positive side we scored a point, so we will continue to work hard to score more in the coming races.\u201d Jody Egginton, Technical Director \u201cIt was a very difficult race for us. Both drivers pushed hard to extract all they could from the package, but we couldn't manage to get the cars moving forward as required. The pace of the car was not there on all compounds, and we struggled for straight-line speed, as such, we weren't able to attack nor hold position in some phases of the race. We leave Melbourne with a lot of data to go through and a lot of work ahead of us in order to be best prepared for Baku.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04 on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Australia at Albert Park Grand Prix Circuit on April 02, 2023 in Melbourne, Australia.

(Photo by Peter Fox/Getty Images) Info Close\n\nFerrari Leclerc was unlucky \u2013 he battled with Alonso, Stroll and Sainz at the start and was tapped into a spin that beached him in the gravel on the very first lap. That left Sainz to fly the flag for the team. He climbed back through the field after unluckily stopping just before the first red flag, and looked to have pace to burn today. But at the second restart he tapped Alonso into a spin, which earned him a five second time penalty. With the race red flagged, and only one formation lap behind the Safety Car remaining, that time penalty dropped the distraught Spaniard from fourth to P12. Charles Leclerc, DNF \"It was unfortunate to end the race this way today, but it was a racing incident and I don\u2019t think that we could have done anything differently. Disappointing, but on to the next one where I hope things will run more smoothly again.\" Carlos Sainz, 12th \"I had a good start and felt confident on the medium tyre but we were unlucky, pitting just before they brought out the first red flag and I dropped down to P11. From there I managed to pull off a good comeback with nice overtakes and solid pace, so for that I\u2019m happy. \"It was a good race overall but the penalty ruined all the effort and I don\u2019t agree with it. The frustration I feel right now will be difficult to digest, but I will try to think only of the positives from today and focus on the next race.\" Fred Vasseur, Team Principal \"Today\u2019s result, not scoring points, does not reflect the progress we have made as a team. We have taken a step forward in terms of pure performance and even more importantly, we had a decent and consistent race pace on the various tyre compounds, including the Hard. Only yesterday\u2019s qualifying did not match our potential. \"Our initial reaction is one of frustration, with Charles clearly unlucky to be involved in a racing incident at the start. It was a good call to bring Carlos in under the first Safety Car, but following the red flag, he had to start again from P11, from which he recovered very well. The penalty had a devastating effect on the final result for him but despite this, we go back to Maranello knowing that we are moving in the right direction and we now have three weeks to keep working on optimising and updating the SF-23 for the coming races.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 3 MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Charles Leclerc of Monaco driving the (16) Ferrari SF-23 gets stuck in a gravel trap during the F1 Grand Prix of Australia at Albert Park Grand Prix Circuit on April 02, 2023 in Melbourne, Australia.

(Photo by Clive Mason - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images) Info Close\n\nAlpine Alpine can count themselves unlucky in Melbourne. Gasly was having a brilliant race, running in fifth for much of the day and exhibiting great race pace in being able to stick with the Ferrari of Sainz and the Aston Martin of Alonso, whilst keeping Stroll behind. As for Ocon, he climbed up into P10 and looks assured of a point at least. But at the final restart, Gasly ran wide and hit his team mate as he returned to the track. That sent them both into the wall in what appeared to be a racing incident after which both were summoned to the Stewards. Esteban Ocon, DNF \u201cIt\u2019s a real shame for both cars not to finish today\u2019s race, especially after showing great pace all weekend. We had the performance to be fighting the Ferraris and the Aston Martins, so to walk away with nothing is a tough one for all of us. The restart at the end was very chaotic and everything went so fast. The clash with Pierre was unfortunate and I\u2019m glad we\u2019re both OK. We\u2019ve spoken about it, and we\u2019re all good and there\u2019s no hard feelings. We\u2019re both already looking forward to the next one and I know the whole team will want to put this weekend behind us.\u201d Pierre Gasly, DNF \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in the outcome of today\u2019s race. We were in fifth place for most of it, chasing Carlos [Sainz] for fourth place and we showed really good race pace. For us to be so close to scoring ten points and leaving without any is a bitter one for us to take. Right now, we must focus on the positives and that is how we managed our race and how we were able to take the fight to our rivals ahead. I\u2019m glad both Esteban and I are OK after the incident. As a team, we\u2019ll move on and keep focused for the next race.\u201d Otmar Szafnauer, Team Principal \u201cWhile it\u2019s disappointing to leave here with zero points, we can be satisfied and positive with the performance of our car today. We showed we can race with our close rivals ahead and, indeed, close cars down and be clinical when it counts. Pierre drove very well today, running much of the race in fifth place and in the fight for a podium alongside the Mercedes, Aston Martin and Ferrari. We must take the positives of this and use it as motivation going forwards. Esteban was certainly unfortunate with the sequence of events early in the race, but he did a good job to climb his way back into the points with some well-judged overtaking moves. It was unfortunate to have both our cars come together at the third standing start and I\u2019m glad both drivers are OK given the nature of the incident. We\u2019ll keep moving forwards and these hard moments are what brings the team closer together. We\u2019re already looking forward to Baku where an upgrade is planned.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Pierre Gasly of France driving the (10) Alpine F1 A523 Renault on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Australia at Albert Park Grand Prix Circuit on April 02, 2023 in Melbourne, Australia.

But he spun off in the early stages under his own steam after losing the rear, bringing out first the Safety Car and then the first red flags due to gravel on the track. Sargeant was working hard from the back of the field, but he was one of very few to require another stop after those red flags which didn\u2019t help his cause. At the second restart, he hit the back of the AlphaTauri of De Vries, which sent him off into the gravel and out of the race. MUST-SEE: Williams' Alex Albon crashes out of promising sixth place in the 2023 Australian Grand Prix and brings out red flags Logan Sargeant, DNF \"The race in general just didn\u2019t quite fall our way, with it being a really tricky day. We pitted to the medium tyre following the first safety car, and it just wasn\u2019t the tyre to be on today and I really struggled with it. Once we got to the hard tyre, the pace wasn\u2019t too bad, so to end it like that is unfortunate. We tried to take some chances today and it just didn\u2019t pay off. I\u2019ve learnt a lot from today, so hopefully can use these learnings going forward.\" Alex Albon, DNF \"We\u2019re still looking at the data but there was nothing unusual in the corner itself. When I lost the car, I was going through slower than the previous lap; I went wide on the corner before and spiked the tyre temperatures, losing grip and going into the next corner a bit hot, so I think that\u2019s what happened but we need to look at it. With all the accidents, it was a good chance to score points this weekend, so I\u2019m very sorry to the team. I\u2019m disappointed, as we had a great car today and were really strong.\" Dave Robson, Head of Vehicle Performance \"It was a remarkable race but ultimately it was a missed opportunity for us. Alex built on his excellent qualifying display to make more positions at the start and was looking good for a comfortable top ten finish. Unfortunately, touching the kerb at high speed in Turn 5 led to a small snap and a spike in tyre temperature, which led him to lose the car at the next corner. \"We tried a different initial strategy with Logan, but the early red flag rendered that ineffective. Although he had some decent pace, he was unable to benefit from the unusual way that race developed ahead. \"We leave Melbourne frustrated that we couldn\u2019t take advantage of our good pace and turn it into points. However, the whole team can be heartened that the car worked very well this weekend and we will be able to put ourselves into similar positions in future races, starting in Baku in a few weeks\u2019 time.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 3 MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - APRIL 02: Alexander Albon of Thailand driving the (23) Williams FW45 Mercedes runs through a gravel trap before crashing during the F1 Grand Prix of Australia at Albert Park Grand Prix Circuit on April 02, 2023 in Melbourne, Australia.

The sport&#8217;s evolution over the past decade into a global entertainment phenomenon is opening it up as a compelling new playground for some unlikely names. Until recently, with Austin, Texas, the only established Grand Prix on U.S. territory, F1 remained a fairly remote concept here in the States, competing for attention with the long-established, home-grown outfits like Nascar. But just last year, F1 Miami was added to the calendar, and this November, F1 Las Vegas will debut, too. The latter will be the first-ever Grand Prix staged at night, with part of the track lying right along the famous strip itself. </p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">Adding venues known first and foremost as hedonistic playgrounds means things are clearly happening in Formula 1. Toss in the runaway success of Netflix's Drive to Survive, which chronicles the real-life drama of F1 racing drivers, and it's pretty clear why now, even more than ever, F1 organizations with deep pockets are lining up to get in on the action. </p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">Trackside, and in the vast hospitality suites that need a battery of lanyards to get into, you can practically smell the money. No expense is spared to entertain and provide the full F1 experience. Smaller brands rarely get much of a look in here. The few fashion sponsors in the game&#8212;think Tommy Hilfiger (Mercedes-AMG Petronas) and Boss (Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant)&#8212;tend to be global megabrands. Yet last week, edgy Milan-based label Palm Angels had its official debut as Entertainment Curator of U.S. team MoneyGram Haas Racing at Miami&#8217;s second Formula 1 Grand Prix. It&#8217;s an unlikely pairing, and a reach for a brand with currently only 50 employees, but for founder and creative director Francesco Ragazzi, it was a compelling opportunity. </p><p id=\"product-eb18f5c2-71e2-4f21-b5dc-4c5a5deb6767\" class=\"css-17pp2fn etrqhn81\"></p><p class=\"top css-1f1nsoy eyaokey2\"><h2 class=\"css-ehkbao e8seki10\">Palm Angels Racing Bowling Shirt</h2></p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525077&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.palmangels.com%2Fen-us%2Fshopping%2Fracing-bowling-shirt-20115875\" class=\"product-image-link eyaokey0 en6kra60 css-15xslai e1c1bym14\"><img alt=\"Racing Bowling Shirt\" title=\"Racing Bowling Shirt\" src=\"https://hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1683911700-20115875_45388521_2048.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0.133xh&amp;resize=980:*\" width=\"2048\" height=\"2731\"></a><p class=\"css-1f1nsoy eyaokey2\"><h2 class=\"css-ehkbao e8seki10\">Palm Angels Racing Bowling Shirt</h2></p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525077&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.palmangels.com%2Fen-us%2Fshopping%2Fracing-bowling-shirt-20115875\" class=\"product-btn-link en6kra60 css-1hilq3j e1c1bym14\">$720 at palmangels.com</a><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">&#8220;I think as an outsider brand, Palm Angels needs to be unique,&#8221; says Ragazzi. &#8220;We must differentiate our communication and our messaging. We compete with all these huge fashion brands and they basically have a monopoly on every type of output from celebrities and ambassadors to marketing in general. To combat that, Palm Angels needs to be a pioneer, doing something for the first time and reaching a different consumer in unexpected ways. There's a real mix of audience now in Formula 1, which is really important. And a lot of that comes from Drive to Survive on Netflix. So, for us, the idea started first with the idea that we need to differentiate Palm Angels. Second is about what's involved in F1. It's sport, of course but it&#8217;s also real entertainment. I like this clash of ideas and I think that mix is why the sport is becoming more and more popular, especially in the States.&#8221; </p><img alt=\"miami international autodrome, united states of america may 05 nico hulkenberg, haas f1 team during the miami gp at miami international autodrome on friday may 05, 2023 in miami, united states of america photo by mark sutton lat images\" title=\"Formula 1 2023: Miami GP\" width=\"2374\" height=\"3561\" src=\"https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/1019612099-sut-20230505-gp2305-104446ms1-8463-645e74be635b1.jpg?resize=980:*\" class=\"css-0 exi4f7p0\"><p class=\"css-1y3mo7s e1xqj1sx1\">Haas driver Nico H&#252;lkenberg wearing Palm Angels in Miami.</p><p class=\"css-1jsgjuc e6iqukd2\">Mark Sutton</p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">Palm Angels, which currently has stores in Miami and Las Vegas (with two more coming in New York and Costa Mesa, California), designed elements of the team&#8217;s garage, the racing suits, and of course those very noticeable Palm Angels logos on the helmets of the drivers and along the flanks of the cars. What must - surely - be the only example of a gothic script logo to feature in Formula 1, Palm Angels's name stands out all the more for it. Alongside the initiative, Palm Angels launched a capsule collection of tops, pants, and jackets featuring an F1 theme imagined in Palm Angels casual style and Team Haas&#8217;s signature red, white, and black color palette.</p><p class=\"css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0\">&#8220;Formula 1 is truly a global sport,&#8221; says Ragazzi. &#8220;Right now, we're in Miami, which is an important market for us, because we have a store here. Then it's going to be in Abu Dhabi and then Singapore and then Las Vegas. It's not like the Super Bowl once a year or World Cup soccer every four years. F1 travels around to so many countries practically all year round; it&#8217;s a logistical nightmare. It&#8217;s almost like having a Super Bowl every other weekend in all these amazing shopping cities.

But it was also attractive to Ragazzi because, like Palm Angels, Haas in Formula 1 is the rank outsider, the upstart on the grid. &#8220;It's an American team,&#8221; he says, &#8220;but it&#8217;s one with a beating, Italian heart, because the team uses Ferrari engines.

            "text": "From left: Palm Angels founder and creative director Francesco Ragazzi, Haas drivers Kevin Magnussen and Nico H\u00fclkenberg. Palm Angels\n\nFormula 1 sponsorship is a big game and it takes big players to get into it, especially now. The sport\u2019s evolution over the past decade into a global entertainment phenomenon is opening it up as a compelling new playground for some unlikely names. Until recently, with Austin, Texas, the only established Grand Prix on U.S. territory, F1 remained a fairly remote concept here in the States, competing for attention with the long-established, home-grown outfits like Nascar. But just last year, F1 Miami was added to the calendar, and this November, F1 Las Vegas will debut, too. The latter will be the first-ever Grand Prix staged at night, with part of the track lying right along the famous strip itself.\n\nAdding venues known first and foremost as hedonistic playgrounds means things are clearly happening in Formula 1. Toss in the runaway success of Netflix's Drive to Survive, which chronicles the real-life drama of F1 racing drivers, and it's pretty clear why now, even more than ever, F1 organizations with deep pockets are lining up to get in on the action.\n\nTrackside, and in the vast hospitality suites that need a battery of lanyards to get into, you can practically smell the money. No expense is spared to entertain and provide the full F1 experience. Smaller brands rarely get much of a look in here. The few fashion sponsors in the game\u2014think Tommy Hilfiger (Mercedes-AMG Petronas) and Boss (Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant)\u2014tend to be global megabrands. Yet last week, edgy Milan-based label Palm Angels had its official debut as Entertainment Curator of U.S. team MoneyGram Haas Racing at Miami\u2019s second Formula 1 Grand Prix. It\u2019s an unlikely pairing, and a reach for a brand with currently only 50 employees, but for founder and creative director Francesco Ragazzi, it was a compelling opportunity.\n\nPalm Angels Racing Bowling Shirt Palm Angels Racing Bowling Shirt $720 at palmangels.com\n\n\u201cI think as an outsider brand, Palm Angels needs to be unique,\u201d says Ragazzi. \u201cWe must differentiate our communication and our messaging. We compete with all these huge fashion brands and they basically have a monopoly on every type of output from celebrities and ambassadors to marketing in general. To combat that, Palm Angels needs to be a pioneer, doing something for the first time and reaching a different consumer in unexpected ways. There's a real mix of audience now in Formula 1, which is really important. And a lot of that comes from Drive to Survive on Netflix. So, for us, the idea started first with the idea that we need to differentiate Palm Angels. Second is about what's involved in F1. It's sport, of course but it\u2019s also real entertainment. I like this clash of ideas and I think that mix is why the sport is becoming more and more popular, especially in the States.\u201d\n\nHaas driver Nico H\u00fclkenberg wearing Palm Angels in Miami. Mark Sutton\n\nPalm Angels, which currently has stores in Miami and Las Vegas (with two more coming in New York and Costa Mesa, California), designed elements of the team\u2019s garage, the racing suits, and of course those very noticeable Palm Angels logos on the helmets of the drivers and along the flanks of the cars. What must - surely - be the only example of a gothic script logo to feature in Formula 1, Palm Angels's name stands out all the more for it. Alongside the initiative, Palm Angels launched a capsule collection of tops, pants, and jackets featuring an F1 theme imagined in Palm Angels casual style and Team Haas\u2019s signature red, white, and black color palette.\n\n\u201cFormula 1 is truly a global sport,\u201d says Ragazzi. \u201cRight now, we're in Miami, which is an important market for us, because we have a store here. Then it's going to be in Abu Dhabi and then Singapore and then Las Vegas. It's not like the Super Bowl once a year or World Cup soccer every four years. F1 travels around to so many countries practically all year round; it\u2019s a logistical nightmare. It\u2019s almost like having a Super Bowl every other weekend in all these amazing shopping cities. For me, that's very interesting.\u201d\n\nKevin Magnussen, also a Haas driver, wearing Palm Angels at the Miami Grand Prix. Mark Sutton\n\nHaas was chosen partly by design, partly out of necessity (thanks to a more attainable entry price for the brand). But it was also attractive to Ragazzi because, like Palm Angels, Haas in Formula 1 is the rank outsider, the upstart on the grid. \u201cIt's an American team,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it\u2019s one with a beating, Italian heart, because the team uses Ferrari engines. It\u2019s also the youngest team. Haas is really the new kid on the block, just like us. For me, that made Haas the perfect partner for us. And the best thing is that they came with no rules or prejudice. So, when we pitched our ideas to them, they were very open-minded.\u201d\n\nPalm Angels Racing Hoodie Palm Angels Racing Hoodie $750 at palmangels.com\n\nPalm Angels audacious plan, to build its global reach through Formula 1, makes more and more sense as the F1 plays up the luxury and glamor while still preserving the thrills-and-spills nature of the adrenaline-rich sport.

            "article_html": "<div><h3>Red Bull</h3>\n<p>Perez lost out to Alonso at the start, but soon picked off the Spaniard and from there was untroubled for much of the race. Verstappen had slowly but surely worked his way back into the reckoning, before the Safety Car came out at the right time and allowed him to jump a couple of places. That meant he was right on his team mate&#8217;s tail with Perez managing the gap superbly until both drivers started to struggle with reliability concerns. But the team confirmed both could push to the finish and they duly did, with Perez coming home ahead.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.perez-details-intense-finale-after-holding-off-verstappen-to-win-at-jeddah.qhI582KzWmsiGRgHOQ1GB.html\">READ MORE: Perez details 'intense' finale after holding off Verstappen to win at Jeddah</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Max Verstappen, 2nd</strong></p>\n<p>\"The beginning of the race was a bit tricky, it was hard to follow in the train of cars because there was very low grip. At one point it all settled down a bit, I could move forward and the safety car helped a little bit. It was about being calm and overtaking the cars one by one. In general P2 was always the target today. Today was about recovering what was possible, if I had qualified P1 then today would have looked very different. I was catching Checo towards the end of the race but we calculated it wouldn&#8217;t be enough to make up the gap to him by the end of the race. I started to feel a vibration in the laps where I was catching and trying to push, I started to feel some instability in the car. Sometimes it&#8217;s better to just tell yourself it&#8217;s better to bring that P2 home. As a Team we have to work on making sure both cars are reliable because we have a very fast car but I still think we can do a better job. I would like a clean weekend in Melbourne to maximise everything we can. I am happy with the way it is turning it out at the moment but it is still a long season.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Sergio Perez, 1st</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I had a wicked race - which is a new word I learnt this week! I didn&#8217;t have a great start but after I got back around Fernando, I was able to create a good gap between the rest of the field and me... until the safety car came out and I was reminded of Jeddah 2022&#8230; It was a new race after the safety car though and I&#8217;m happy I was able to build a gap again and then keep it, even when Max was pushing at the end. Everyone back in Milton Keynes and here at the track have built such a fantastic car for us this season. I love being a part of this Team because of the way we push and the way we deliver, I&#8217;m so proud of us. The Team is working at such a high level so it&#8217;s really great to be a part of. In the end, we must remember it&#8217;s a long season but tonight was a massive team result.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Christian Horner, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>\"What a race! All credit to the Team today. They&#8217;ve built an incredible car. That coupled with some truly fantastic driving has made for the best start to a season in our history, consecutive 1-2 finishes. Max had a mountain to climb, overcoming a significant deficit, but with over half the race to go, was already in P4. Similarly, Checo turned in an equally outstanding performance, perhaps the best drive I have ever seen from him. They were both going flat out, hard at it. Both drivers were free to race and they went for it. Max secured the fastest lap and Checo came away with the victory. It was an exemplary performance from both drivers, the Team here at the track and everyone back at the factory. There is a tremendous amount of work that goes into a race such as this and it is the epitome of a team performing at the top of their game. We wont rest on it though, Australia is just around the corner. It is a track that has not been kind to us in the past so we want to ensure we are prepared, just as we were here, to give us the best chance of success and another first class performance.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Race winner Sergio Perez of Mexico and Oracle Red Bull Racing\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Race winner Sergio Perez of Mexico and Oracle Red Bull Racing\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Second placed Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle Red\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">3</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Race winner Sergio Perez of Mexico and Oracle Red Bull Racing celebrates in parc ferme during the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 19, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Although he lost out to both Red Bulls from there, he was comfortably ahead of the rest of the field. But he did get handed a five-second penalty for being out of his grid slot at the start, and when serving it, the mechanics started working on his car too early. That earned him a post-race 10-second penalty, which dropped him from third to fourth, only for the decision to be reversed a few hours later. As for Stroll, he was making good progress and was in the mix before being told to stop the car out on track with an issue.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.breaking-alonso-loses-p3-and-100th-f1-podium-after-receiving-10s-penalty-in.4QbFJtlN8sUWqQXt4jJmmR.html\">READ MORE: &#8216;I am happy in the end with the result&#8217; &#8211; Alonso relieved after 100th career podium reinstated in Jeddah</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Fernando Alonso, 3rd</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I am happy in the end with the result tonight and our second podium. We showed that we can be the second fastest team and we had good pace throughout the race. It was my mistake at the start with the position on the grid, but we pushed to make up that time. Coming into this weekend we were not sure exactly where we would be, so this is good news for us going into the next few races. I am looking forward to Australia next.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Lance Stroll, DNF</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was disappointing to retire from the Grand Prix after such a promising weekend. I had a great start and really enjoyed overtaking Carlos [Sainz] around the outside of Turn 13. We were in a good position on track and I was having fun pushing, but then I started experiencing reduced power and got the call to stop the car. It is not the result we wanted, but we leave Saudi Arabia knowing that we have a very competitive car and we will pick up the fight next time out in Australia.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Mike Krack, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It is very satisfying to score our second podium of the year with Fernando here in Jeddah. It is Fernando&#8217;s 100th career podium, which is a very impressive milestone. The car has been competitive throughout the weekend and we showed strong race pace once again tonight. Full credit to everyone in the team for their hard work this week. It is a real shame that Lance was forced to retire early with an energy recovery issue, the cause of which is still being investigated, because he had strong pace and would surely have scored big points tonight as well.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Third placed Fernando Alonso of Spain and Aston Martin F1 Team\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Lance Stroll of Canada and Aston Martin F1 Team looks on prior to\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Third placed Fernando Alonso of Spain and Aston Martin F1 Team celebrates on the podium during the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 19, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Both drivers were able to pit behind the Safety Car and that left Russell ahead on the hards and Hamilton behind on mediums. But the team didn&#8217;t issue any orders, and Hamilton couldn&#8217;t find a way past his team mate despite arguably better rubber. As it was, Russell then briefly inherited third place thanks to Alonso&#8217;s post-race penalty, only to lose the position a few hours later, as Hamilton came home P5.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.russell-calls-alonso-penalty-harsh-as-he-inherits-p3-in-jeddah-after-one-of.7aNJUyy78dD1KiaBrVVQvx.html\">READ MORE: Russell calls Alonso penalty &#8216;harsh&#8217; as he inherits P3 in Jeddah after &#8216;one of my strongest weekends in F1&#8217;</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Lewis Hamilton, 5th</strong></p>\n<p>\"We got some great points as a Team today... I was able to move forward from seventh to fifth, which is the main thing. If I had qualified better then maybe I could have got a better result, but we still got some points. My set-up this weekend has been the biggest issue I've faced. I got it wrong for Qualifying and it wasn't good in the race either, so I struggled today. We were trying to go long on the hard tyre, but the Safety Car came out, so I had to pit. We just about managed to make the medium work, but it was a long second stint. We didn't have the same tyre degradation as we did in Bahrain, though. We were a lot closer to some of those ahead and it's great to be in the top five, ahead of the Ferraris. There is lots to work on but there are positives to take away from this weekend.\"</p>\n<p><strong>George Russell, 4th</strong></p>\n<p>\"When you put the hard work in and it pays dividends, you come away feeling satisfied. We finished ahead of both Ferraris on merit today and we know we've got a lot of performance to come soon. The gap to the Red Bulls is still considerable, but we'll take the positives from the weekend, keep fighting as hard as we can and focusing on ourselves. It was an interesting race. After the Safety Car I was on the hard tyre and Lewis was behind on the medium. He had a bit more pace at the beginning, but I knew my pace would come at the end. Fernando deserved to be on the podium today and I was pleased with P4.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport</strong></p>\n<p>\"Today was positive... I think we saw some performance gains to Bahrain which is encouraging. It shows us that the development trajectory is going in the right direction. I think both of our drivers under our guidance probably over-managed their tyres a bit, and we had a little more pace. Bahrain is still in our heads, and we could have maybe pushed more. It was a strong drive from George and a great recovery from Lewis to get solid points. Red Bull are still far away in terms of performance and that won't be easy to catch. Nevertheless, today we've seen that our development is heading in the way we want to head.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director</strong></p>\n<p>\"A good effort by the team and both drivers today to collect some very useful points and clearly a pleasing end to the weekend for George... The car is hard work to get into the right window and it's not as easy for the drivers as it needs to be, but we've certainly found a better balance than in Bahrain and it has been a lot kinder on its tyres. We're under no illusion that we have a lot of work to do. We've been busy at the factory searching for performance and the initial findings are encouraging which gives us the motivation to keep working hard to improve. Today, we did exactly what we needed to do, which is to maximise the potential in what we have. We're looking forward to the next race in Melbourne; it's closer in characteristics to Saudi than Bahrain, so hopefully we'll have a car that we can fight for a podium. If there is any more performance that we can bring we'll make sure we get it to the track.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: George Russell of Great Britain driving the (63) Mercedes AMG\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Carlos Sainz of Spain driving (55) the Ferrari SF-23 and Lewis\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: George Russell of Great Britain driving the (63) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W14 leads Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain and Mercedes during the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 19, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Both lost out to Tsunoda in the pit stops after the Japanese racer used the Safety Car timing to good effect, but both soon got back past. Gasly had one look at his team mate at the restart, but after that they held station to the line to pick up a handful of points for the team.</p>\n<p><strong>Esteban Ocon, 8th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Overall, I would say it&#8217;s been a reasonable race for the team. The final result reflects our performance in the race and eighth place is the maximum we could have achieved today. Having both cars in the points is definitely positive, especially after Bahrain, but we must not be completely satisfied with where we are at the moment. Our car has potential and we will continue learning and building to catch up to our competitors. We want to challenge for positions higher up the grid, and we will keep working hard to do that. We will debrief on this weekend and our attention will quickly turn to Australia where we&#8217;ll aim for more.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Pierre Gasly, 9th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely satisfying to make it two points finishes from my first two races with the team. I think finishing in eighth and ninth was the best we could achieve today, though. We&#8217;re making positive steps; we&#8217;re learning things each time we get in the car and we must continue to apply that knowledge to keep improving the overall package. On my side, there&#8217;s more to come, especially in extracting the maximum in Qualifying, which will allow us better track position for the Race. I&#8217;m looking forward to debriefing with the team, continuing my learning and going again in Australia where we want to show further improvements.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Otmar Szafnauer, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s race highlighted many things: areas where we know there are positives and other areas where we need to improve. Finishing with Esteban in eighth and Pierre in ninth was probably the best we could achieve today and we&#8217;re making steps in the right direction towards our targets. We&#8217;re not where we want to be right now, that is clear, and we have a lot of hard work ahead of us if we&#8217;re to take the fight further up the grid. We&#8217;ve reeled in some of the teams who were in front of us in the championship last year and we must continue to chip away at that gap and close it. As a team we&#8217;ll debrief on this weekend as there are many positives as well as some finer details for us to improve on. We have a good batch of upgrades coming up as per our development plan and we look forward to Australia in two weeks&#8217; time where we aim to apply our learnings and again come away with a good team result.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Logan Sargeant of United States driving the (2) Williams FW45\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Pierre Gasly of France driving the (10) Alpine F1 A523 Renault on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Logan Sargeant of United States driving the (2) Williams FW45 Mercedes leads Esteban Ocon of France driving the (31) Alpine F1 A523 Renault and Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04 during the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 19, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Magnussen had to bide his time behind Tsunoda for a huge number of laps with a few aborted overtake attempts for good measure, before finally managing to overtake the AlphaTauri late on to grab the final point on offer.</p>\n<p><strong>Nico Hulkenberg, 12th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was eventful. It&#8217;s always a massive challenge here on this track and it was tight. On one hand I&#8217;m disappointed I missed out on a point, but on the other hand I&#8217;m very pleased that I completed the race and we&#8217;ve learned a lot. The underlying positive news is that we&#8217;re competitive. It was difficult to judge in Bahrain with damage, but here today we&#8217;re definitely competitive in the midfield and that makes me happy.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Magnussen, 10th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;A point means a lot. We didn&#8217;t start the weekend on the right foot but it seemed like we really turned things around and found a groove for qualifying. Unfortunately, we had this issue with the gearbox that we didn&#8217;t have today, which was really nice. We were able to have a good race, get a good start, manage the tyres well &#8211; especially on the hard compound when I was on older tyres than Tsunoda and actually had less degradation. I was then able to get past him at the end, and we managed to get a point.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Guenther Steiner, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;First point this season. We had the speed but didn&#8217;t luck into it as some people were in a better position after the Safety Car, but the drivers fought hard, and we got a point. The whole team performed flawlessly all weekend, they kept their heads up and everyone just kept on pushing. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to be doing all season long and I&#8217;m really looking forward to going to Australia now. As I said after Bahrain, I didn&#8217;t really know where we were with the car, but we now know where we think we are. We&#8217;re in the mix, we&#8217;re actually pretty good I think &#8211; it&#8217;s all coming together. We didn&#8217;t panic after Bahrain &#8211; now we&#8217;re cautiously optimistic.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Nico Hulkenberg of Germany driving the (27) Haas F1 VF-23 Ferrari\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04 leads Kevin Magnussen of Denmark driving the (20) Haas F1 VF-23 Ferrari during the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 19, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

But he couldn&#8217;t hold the quicker Alpine cars at bay and fell to 10th. From there, his stern defence came close to netting him a point but in the end, the Haas of Magnussen just had too much pace. As for De Vries, he was involved in some fun moves late on as he continues to build experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Nyck de Vries, 14th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t do a good enough job today. I lost most of my momentum at the start and restart, so I got stuck in traffic. It's difficult to regain that rhythm and make up the positions, especially when you&#8217;re caught in a DRS train. I didn&#8217;t attack enough and struggled to find the balance between managing the tyres well and pushing, so I was unable to get them to the right temperature. In the end, when I was in clean air chasing Zhou, my pace was very strong and consistent. Generally, it was a step up from Bahrain, so that&#8217;s a positive. We definitely need to keep going and continue to push.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Yuki Tsunoda, 11th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I ended the race in P11, it's frustrating to lose the position with only four laps to go. The team did a really great job, everything went perfectly. The pace on the medium tyre was very strong and it improved compared to qualifying. I'm happy with what the team and I achieved together, but at the same time, I&#8217;m disappointed we didn&#8217;t reach the points in the end. We&#8217;ll come back stronger with updates in Melbourne, so we are already fully focussed on the next race, where we will do our best to maximise our performance. We'll continue to work hard to be able to fight at the top of the midfield and start scoring points consistently.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Jody Egginton, Technical Director</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Both drivers delivered a solid race putting in consistent lap times tonight. The strategy was good, and the double stack pitstop under the Safety Car worked well as we gained track position. We achieved this as both drivers managed the medium tyre very well, meaning we could extend the first stint and not lose time to our midfield competitors, who stopped for the hard compound earlier. This strategy, together with the Safety Car, put Yuki into the fight for the final points positions tonight. Although Yuki put up a good fight for eighth, the Alpines were quicker and he couldn't keep them behind for long. However, he was able to fight with Magnussen for P10 for most of the final stint, defending from consistent pressure and only losing out in the last laps for the final point, finishing P11. We weren't able to move Nyck into the points with the strategy, but he made some progress from his starting position, had some good battles, and was putting in solid lap times on both compounds tonight. It&#8217;s frustrating to miss out on a point, but there were positives to take from the drivers and team&#8217;s performance tonight. We're now looking forward to the planned aero developments and we trust they will improve our performance in the upcoming events.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04 on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Nyck de Vries of Netherlands driving the (21) Scuderia AlphaTauri\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04 on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 19, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

He pitted very early, then again under the Safety Car and then a third time after struggling for grip. The team did check his radiators for damage as the Finn complained of a total lack of speed as he trawled home last. As for Zhou, he was in the thick of the battles in the midfield with the Haas drivers but couldn&#8217;t quite manage to fight his way closer to the points.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.highlights-watch-the-action-from-a-thrilling-saudi-arabian-grand-prix-as.olTD2Qkd67JhLRbF19ruw.html\">HIGHLIGHTS: Watch the action from a thrilling Saudi Arabian Grand Prix as Perez leads a Red Bull 1-2</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Valtteri Bottas, 18th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Our qualifying performance yesterday was similar to the one we had in Bahrain, so we had good hopes for tonight, but unfortunately the race was a very different affair. The car didn&#8217;t feel right, we couldn&#8217;t get any grip from the beginning of the race and we need to figure out exactly what happened. I ran over a large piece of debris on lap one, so perhaps I was carrying some damage to the floor: we&#8217;ll look at the car and at the data and understand more to prepare for Melbourne. I believe our car is much better than what we&#8217;ve shown tonight: Zhou had a much better pace, so I don&#8217;t think this weekend was very representative, and I am confident we can be back fighting for points in Australia.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Zhou Guanyu, 13th</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We looked strong in the first stint, our pace was good and it seemed the top ten was within reach. Of course, track position always makes the difference on street circuits like this one, and, unfortunately, I got stuck in a DRS train once the Safety Car came out. My race was compromised from that moment onwards, and there wasn&#8217;t much more we could do. Today just hasn&#8217;t been our day, but I think we can achieve much more as a team going forward. We get a new chance in a few weeks in Melbourne, where we will be bringing some upgrades to our car: hopefully they&#8217;ll allow us to make the step forward we need to continue fighting for points. We&#8217;re have shown we can do it and that we can fight towards the front, and I am confident we can achieve that again in Australia.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Alessandro Alunni Bravi, Team Representative</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Starting where we were on the grid, we were expecting to fight for the points, but, unfortunately, we weren&#8217;t able to finish in the top ten this time around. The team had a difficult weekend, and we weren&#8217;t able to be at the level for which we aimed: we&#8217;ll need to go back to base, analyse the data from this performance and understand where we&#8217;ve fallen short, and what steps we need to make to return to the level we were in Bahrain. We are confident we can make it there in Melbourne, where we will also bring some updates to further improve the performance of our C43. We need to keep working hard, of course: the season is long and the battle will be intense in each race.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Zhou Guanyu of China driving the (24) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari prepares to drive on the grid prior to the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 19, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Both had to immediately pit for replacement front wings, and both dropped to the back as a result. From there the race was more about gathering data and getting Piastri more used to F1 machinery in race conditions, but the two were allowed to fight at one point, with Piastri managing to make his way past his team mate despite being on the same set of tyres from the end of the first lap to the finish.</p>\n<p><strong>Lando Norris, 17th</strong></p>\n<p>\"Tough race, we were very unlucky today. I had a really good start but then got hit with debris which damaged my front wing. We did our best to try to come out with something, but no luck was on our side. We did the best job we could, working as a team, but it was difficult to achieve anything more than what we did. So, it&#8217;s tough, but now our focus is on Australia where we hope to do a better job.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Oscar Piastri, 15th</strong></p>\n<p>\"Obviously it&#8217;s not the day we were looking for, there was contact at the beginning where I lost part of my front wing. I&#8217;m not sure if there was anything I could have done really, I was squeezed a little bit. There was some good racing at the end, which was nice and obviously I did a long stint on the Hards, so it&#8217;s good to get a bit of learning for the tyres but overall, it&#8217;s not what we were looking for tonight.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Andrea Stella, Team Principal</strong></p>\n<p>\"After beginning the race with high hopes of scoring points, we had both cars at the back of the pack after the first lap and we come away from Jeddah empty-handed. Oscar had contact at the first corner, which required him to pit with a broken front wing, while Lando hit the debris coming off Oscar&#8217;s car and also suffered a broken front wing.</p>\n<p>\"We&#8217;re racers, we take these things on the chin, and we will be even more determined to succeed when we get to Australia.

He had to complete an extra lap of the track to scrub enough speed to actually make it into the pit lane, managing the problem astutely to make sure he got back to his garage in one piece. That left Sargeant to fly the flag for the team and he ran 12th for a chunk of the evening, before losing out to fellow rookies De Vries and Sargeant in the last few laps.</p>\n<p><strong>Logan Sargeant, 16th</strong></p>\n<p>\"Today I struggled a bit more than yesterday. The first 30 laps or so were pretty good and then I just struggled there at the end to keep a hold of the tyres, we were losing a lot of grip. Nevertheless, we made it through another one and learned a lot. I definitely feel more confident ahead of the next race. I showed this weekend that on a difficult track I can be really quick, so I can take that going into Melbourne and hopefully replicate and keep improving. Over the past two races I&#8217;ve learned an enormous amount; I feel like everything is becoming more natural and I&#8217;m trying to get things to become second nature and keep implementing them. It&#8217;s not going to happen all at once, it&#8217;s more a case of constantly building and understanding better.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Alex Albon, DNF</strong></p>\n<p>\"It was a frustrating day, as this weekend we felt really strong as a team and I&#8217;ve been really impressed with where the car is compared to where we were last year. It&#8217;s been such a pleasure getting to drive the car and unfortunately when it mattered in qualifying, we couldn&#8217;t quite execute, followed by the issue in the race, so it&#8217;s frustrating as we could have scored points this weekend. I&#8217;d much rather be disappointed, knowing the car has got pace than just finishing at the back, so it&#8217;s a different kind of disappointment with lots of positives and the opportunity to turn it around and come back fighting.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Dave Robson, Head of Vehicle Performance</strong></p>\n<p>\"The pace was good today and Alex had a good chance of finishing in the top 10. Unfortunately, he was forced to retire with an issue in the mechanical brake system, which we will investigate and fix before the next race. This is a shame as a lot of good work was done here and in Grove on Friday evening to prepare the cars for the race.</p>\n<p>\"Logan&#8217;s race was compromised by the Safety Car, which left him with a lengthy stint on the Medium tyre and a defensive race against a close group of cars. He eventually lost a few places to faster cars but gave a good performance in his 2nd Formula 1 race.</p>\n<p>\"We can take a lot of positives away from this weekend but at the same time we missed a good opportunity to score some more points and we must make some improvements to succeed in a very tight midfield.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Alexander Albon of Thailand driving the (23) Williams FW45\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Logan Sargeant of United States driving the (2) Williams FW45\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Alexander Albon of Thailand driving the (23) Williams FW45 Mercedes locks a wheel under braking in front of Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari during the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 19, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Eighty per cent of the drivers chose the medium at the start, which ensured maximum flexibility in the event of a race neutralisation &#8211; which duly happened for the third time in three years of racing here.</p>\n<p>\"The arrival of the Safety Car following Lance Stroll&#8217;s retirement coincided with the pit stop window, which meant that the drivers who hadn&#8217;t made a stop so far were able to take advantage of this neutralisation to put on the hard tyre. The performance gaps between the compounds also fitted in with our expectations, and that was the case for degradation as well. This was practically nothing on the medium and hard tyres, and quite limited on the soft used by Charles Leclerc: the only driver to have carried out a significant stint on this compound.</p>\n<p>\"The absence of degradation was what allowed even the drivers who had fitted the hard tyre before the safety car came out &#8211; such as Kevin Magnussen and Oscar Piastri, who completed 42 and 49 laps on it respectively &#8211; to push all the way to the end, with both of them pulling off some great passing moves in the closing stages. The medium also showed a lot of consistency, as underlined by Lewis Hamilton, who was able to take advantage of its superior performance compared to the hard in order to get past Carlos Sainz shortly after the re-start.\"</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.facts-and-stats-perez-leads-a-red-bull-1-2-for-the-very-first-time.5qUXwV8dh8ajgbZ1irDu9h.html\">FACTS AND STATS: Perez leads a Red Bull 1-2 for the very first time</a></strong></p>\n\n    </div>",

That meant he was right on his team mate\u2019s tail with Perez managing the gap superbly until both drivers started to struggle with reliability concerns. But the team confirmed both could push to the finish and they duly did, with Perez coming home ahead. READ MORE: Perez details 'intense' finale after holding off Verstappen to win at Jeddah Max Verstappen, 2nd \"The beginning of the race was a bit tricky, it was hard to follow in the train of cars because there was very low grip. At one point it all settled down a bit, I could move forward and the safety car helped a little bit. It was about being calm and overtaking the cars one by one. In general P2 was always the target today. Today was about recovering what was possible, if I had qualified P1 then today would have looked very different. I was catching Checo towards the end of the race but we calculated it wouldn\u2019t be enough to make up the gap to him by the end of the race. I started to feel a vibration in the laps where I was catching and trying to push, I started to feel some instability in the car. Sometimes it\u2019s better to just tell yourself it\u2019s better to bring that P2 home. As a Team we have to work on making sure both cars are reliable because we have a very fast car but I still think we can do a better job. I would like a clean weekend in Melbourne to maximise everything we can. I am happy with the way it is turning it out at the moment but it is still a long season.\" Sergio Perez, 1st \u201cI had a wicked race - which is a new word I learnt this week! I didn\u2019t have a great start but after I got back around Fernando, I was able to create a good gap between the rest of the field and me... until the safety car came out and I was reminded of Jeddah 2022\u2026 It was a new race after the safety car though and I\u2019m happy I was able to build a gap again and then keep it, even when Max was pushing at the end. Everyone back in Milton Keynes and here at the track have built such a fantastic car for us this season. I love being a part of this Team because of the way we push and the way we deliver, I\u2019m so proud of us. The Team is working at such a high level so it\u2019s really great to be a part of. In the end, we must remember it\u2019s a long season but tonight was a massive team result.\" Christian Horner, Team Principal \"What a race! All credit to the Team today. They\u2019ve built an incredible car. That coupled with some truly fantastic driving has made for the best start to a season in our history, consecutive 1-2 finishes. Max had a mountain to climb, overcoming a significant deficit, but with over half the race to go, was already in P4. Similarly, Checo turned in an equally outstanding performance, perhaps the best drive I have ever seen from him. They were both going flat out, hard at it. Both drivers were free to race and they went for it. Max secured the fastest lap and Checo came away with the victory. It was an exemplary performance from both drivers, the Team here at the track and everyone back at the factory. There is a tremendous amount of work that goes into a race such as this and it is the epitome of a team performing at the top of their game. We wont rest on it though, Australia is just around the corner. It is a track that has not been kind to us in the past so we want to ensure we are prepared, just as we were here, to give us the best chance of success and another first class performance.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 3 JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Race winner Sergio Perez of Mexico and Oracle Red Bull Racing celebrates in parc ferme during the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 19, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Although he lost out to both Red Bulls from there, he was comfortably ahead of the rest of the field. But he did get handed a five-second penalty for being out of his grid slot at the start, and when serving it, the mechanics started working on his car too early. That earned him a post-race 10-second penalty, which dropped him from third to fourth, only for the decision to be reversed a few hours later. As for Stroll, he was making good progress and was in the mix before being told to stop the car out on track with an issue.

It is Fernando\u2019s 100th career podium, which is a very impressive milestone. The car has been competitive throughout the weekend and we showed strong race pace once again tonight. Full credit to everyone in the team for their hard work this week.

I was able to move forward from seventh to fifth, which is the main thing. If I had qualified better then maybe I could have got a better result, but we still got some points. My set-up this weekend has been the biggest issue I've faced. I got it wrong for Qualifying and it wasn't good in the race either, so I struggled today. We were trying to go long on the hard tyre, but the Safety Car came out, so I had to pit. We just about managed to make the medium work, but it was a long second stint. We didn't have the same tyre degradation as we did in Bahrain, though. We were a lot closer to some of those ahead and it's great to be in the top five, ahead of the Ferraris. There is lots to work on but there are positives to take away from this weekend.\" George Russell, 4th \"When you put the hard work in and it pays dividends, you come away feeling satisfied. We finished ahead of both Ferraris on merit today and we know we've got a lot of performance to come soon. The gap to the Red Bulls is still considerable, but we'll take the positives from the weekend, keep fighting as hard as we can and focusing on ourselves. It was an interesting race. After the Safety Car I was on the hard tyre and Lewis was behind on the medium. He had a bit more pace at the beginning, but I knew my pace would come at the end. Fernando deserved to be on the podium today and I was pleased with P4.\" Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport \"Today was positive... I think we saw some performance gains to Bahrain which is encouraging. It shows us that the development trajectory is going in the right direction. I think both of our drivers under our guidance probably over-managed their tyres a bit, and we had a little more pace. Bahrain is still in our heads, and we could have maybe pushed more. It was a strong drive from George and a great recovery from Lewis to get solid points. Red Bull are still far away in terms of performance and that won't be easy to catch. Nevertheless, today we've seen that our development is heading in the way we want to head.\" Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director \"A good effort by the team and both drivers today to collect some very useful points and clearly a pleasing end to the weekend for George... The car is hard work to get into the right window and it's not as easy for the drivers as it needs to be, but we've certainly found a better balance than in Bahrain and it has been a lot kinder on its tyres. We're under no illusion that we have a lot of work to do. We've been busy at the factory searching for performance and the initial findings are encouraging which gives us the motivation to keep working hard to improve. Today, we did exactly what we needed to do, which is to maximise the potential in what we have. We're looking forward to the next race in Melbourne; it's closer in characteristics to Saudi than Bahrain, so hopefully we'll have a car that we can fight for a podium. If there is any more performance that we can bring we'll make sure we get it to the track.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: George Russell of Great Britain driving the (63) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W14 leads Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain and Mercedes during the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 19, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Leclerc at least made good progress on the soft tyre at the start, climbing up through the field with both drivers leapfrogging Stroll in the pit stops. But they stopped before the Safety Car came out and thus lost some time as a result. From there, they couldn\u2019t get on the pace of the Mercedes cars ahead and came home a long way behind the front-runners.

Our first stint on the softs was pretty strong and I could push, making up some positions. Just after we switched to Hards, the Safety Car came out so unfortunately we didn\u2019t gain an advantage there. Our pace was not as good as we expected on the Hards and the rest of the race was spent in a train with Carlos. We have work to do on our race pace and will push to come back stronger in Australia.\" Carlos Sainz, 6th \"It was a tough Sunday. Going into the race and looking at the sessions over the weekend, we were expecting a better race pace. We have work to do and we know the car is not where we want it to be at the moment. However, we will keep pushing and I am fully confident we can improve the situation.\" Fred Vasseur, Team Principal \"Overall, we can\u2019t be satisfied with today\u2019s result. We did not have the pace we were expecting from our car, especially on the hard tyre. There was also a big gap in our performance level between qualifying and the race. \"However, there were some positives today, starting with Charles\u2019 pace on the soft tyres which was good and allowed him to make up six positions on his first stint. Carlos also ran well on the Mediums. Our strategy was on point and our pit crew executed two good stops. \"There is still a long way to go this season and we will continue to fight. We are fully committed to maximising our package and further developing the SF-23 for the coming rounds.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Carlos Sainz of Spain driving (55) the Ferrari SF-23 on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 19, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Both lost out to Tsunoda in the pit stops after the Japanese racer used the Safety Car timing to good effect, but both soon got back past. Gasly had one look at his team mate at the restart, but after that they held station to the line to pick up a handful of points for the team. Esteban Ocon, 8th \u201cOverall, I would say it\u2019s been a reasonable race for the team. The final result reflects our performance in the race and eighth place is the maximum we could have achieved today. Having both cars in the points is definitely positive, especially after Bahrain, but we must not be completely satisfied with where we are at the moment. Our car has potential and we will continue learning and building to catch up to our competitors. We want to challenge for positions higher up the grid, and we will keep working hard to do that. We will debrief on this weekend and our attention will quickly turn to Australia where we\u2019ll aim for more.\u201d Pierre Gasly, 9th \u201cIt\u2019s definitely satisfying to make it two points finishes from my first two races with the team. I think finishing in eighth and ninth was the best we could achieve today, though. We\u2019re making positive steps; we\u2019re learning things each time we get in the car and we must continue to apply that knowledge to keep improving the overall package. On my side, there\u2019s more to come, especially in extracting the maximum in Qualifying, which will allow us better track position for the Race. I\u2019m looking forward to debriefing with the team, continuing my learning and going again in Australia where we want to show further improvements.\u201d Otmar Szafnauer, Team Principal \u201cToday\u2019s race highlighted many things: areas where we know there are positives and other areas where we need to improve. Finishing with Esteban in eighth and Pierre in ninth was probably the best we could achieve today and we\u2019re making steps in the right direction towards our targets. We\u2019re not where we want to be right now, that is clear, and we have a lot of hard work ahead of us if we\u2019re to take the fight further up the grid. We\u2019ve reeled in some of the teams who were in front of us in the championship last year and we must continue to chip away at that gap and close it. As a team we\u2019ll debrief on this weekend as there are many positives as well as some finer details for us to improve on. We have a good batch of upgrades coming up as per our development plan and we look forward to Australia in two weeks\u2019 time where we aim to apply our learnings and again come away with a good team result.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Logan Sargeant of United States driving the (2) Williams FW45 Mercedes leads Esteban Ocon of France driving the (31) Alpine F1 A523 Renault and Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04 during the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 19, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Magnussen had to bide his time behind Tsunoda for a huge number of laps with a few aborted overtake attempts for good measure, before finally managing to overtake the AlphaTauri late on to grab the final point on offer. Nico Hulkenberg, 12th \u201cIt was eventful. It\u2019s always a massive challenge here on this track and it was tight. On one hand I\u2019m disappointed I missed out on a point, but on the other hand I\u2019m very pleased that I completed the race and we\u2019ve learned a lot. The underlying positive news is that we\u2019re competitive. It was difficult to judge in Bahrain with damage, but here today we\u2019re definitely competitive in the midfield and that makes me happy.\u201d Kevin Magnussen, 10th \u201cA point means a lot. We didn\u2019t start the weekend on the right foot but it seemed like we really turned things around and found a groove for qualifying. Unfortunately, we had this issue with the gearbox that we didn\u2019t have today, which was really nice. We were able to have a good race, get a good start, manage the tyres well \u2013 especially on the hard compound when I was on older tyres than Tsunoda and actually had less degradation. I was then able to get past him at the end, and we managed to get a point.\u201d Guenther Steiner, Team Principal \u201cFirst point this season. We had the speed but didn\u2019t luck into it as some people were in a better position after the Safety Car, but the drivers fought hard, and we got a point. The whole team performed flawlessly all weekend, they kept their heads up and everyone just kept on pushing. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be doing all season long and I\u2019m really looking forward to going to Australia now. As I said after Bahrain, I didn\u2019t really know where we were with the car, but we now know where we think we are. We\u2019re in the mix, we\u2019re actually pretty good I think \u2013 it\u2019s all coming together. We didn\u2019t panic after Bahrain \u2013 now we\u2019re cautiously optimistic.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04 leads Kevin Magnussen of Denmark driving the (20) Haas F1 VF-23 Ferrari during the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 19, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

(Photo by Peter Fox/Getty Images) Info Close\n\nAlphaTauri Tsunoda was the driver to really luck out under the Safety Car, jumping into the points as a result of the timing of his pit stop. But he couldn\u2019t hold the quicker Alpine cars at bay and fell to 10th. From there, his stern defence came close to netting him a point but in the end, the Haas of Magnussen just had too much pace. As for De Vries, he was involved in some fun moves late on as he continues to build experience. Nyck de Vries, 14th \u201cI didn\u2019t do a good enough job today. I lost most of my momentum at the start and restart, so I got stuck in traffic. It's difficult to regain that rhythm and make up the positions, especially when you\u2019re caught in a DRS train. I didn\u2019t attack enough and struggled to find the balance between managing the tyres well and pushing, so I was unable to get them to the right temperature. In the end, when I was in clean air chasing Zhou, my pace was very strong and consistent. Generally, it was a step up from Bahrain, so that\u2019s a positive. We definitely need to keep going and continue to push.\u201d Yuki Tsunoda, 11th \u201cI ended the race in P11, it's frustrating to lose the position with only four laps to go. The team did a really great job, everything went perfectly. The pace on the medium tyre was very strong and it improved compared to qualifying. I'm happy with what the team and I achieved together, but at the same time, I\u2019m disappointed we didn\u2019t reach the points in the end. We\u2019ll come back stronger with updates in Melbourne, so we are already fully focussed on the next race, where we will do our best to maximise our performance. We'll continue to work hard to be able to fight at the top of the midfield and start scoring points consistently.\" Jody Egginton, Technical Director \u201cBoth drivers delivered a solid race putting in consistent lap times tonight. The strategy was good, and the double stack pitstop under the Safety Car worked well as we gained track position. We achieved this as both drivers managed the medium tyre very well, meaning we could extend the first stint and not lose time to our midfield competitors, who stopped for the hard compound earlier. This strategy, together with the Safety Car, put Yuki into the fight for the final points positions tonight. Although Yuki put up a good fight for eighth, the Alpines were quicker and he couldn't keep them behind for long. However, he was able to fight with Magnussen for P10 for most of the final stint, defending from consistent pressure and only losing out in the last laps for the final point, finishing P11. We weren't able to move Nyck into the points with the strategy, but he made some progress from his starting position, had some good battles, and was putting in solid lap times on both compounds tonight. It\u2019s frustrating to miss out on a point, but there were positives to take from the drivers and team\u2019s performance tonight. We're now looking forward to the planned aero developments and we trust they will improve our performance in the upcoming events.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Yuki Tsunoda of Japan driving the (22) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT04 on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 19, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

The team did check his radiators for damage as the Finn complained of a total lack of speed as he trawled home last. As for Zhou, he was in the thick of the battles in the midfield with the Haas drivers but couldn\u2019t quite manage to fight his way closer to the points. HIGHLIGHTS: Watch the action from a thrilling Saudi Arabian Grand Prix as Perez leads a Red Bull 1-2 Valtteri Bottas, 18th \u201cOur qualifying performance yesterday was similar to the one we had in Bahrain, so we had good hopes for tonight, but unfortunately the race was a very different affair. The car didn\u2019t feel right, we couldn\u2019t get any grip from the beginning of the race and we need to figure out exactly what happened. I ran over a large piece of debris on lap one, so perhaps I was carrying some damage to the floor: we\u2019ll look at the car and at the data and understand more to prepare for Melbourne. I believe our car is much better than what we\u2019ve shown tonight: Zhou had a much better pace, so I don\u2019t think this weekend was very representative, and I am confident we can be back fighting for points in Australia.\u201d Zhou Guanyu, 13th \u201cWe looked strong in the first stint, our pace was good and it seemed the top ten was within reach. Of course, track position always makes the difference on street circuits like this one, and, unfortunately, I got stuck in a DRS train once the Safety Car came out. My race was compromised from that moment onwards, and there wasn\u2019t much more we could do. Today just hasn\u2019t been our day, but I think we can achieve much more as a team going forward. We get a new chance in a few weeks in Melbourne, where we will be bringing some upgrades to our car: hopefully they\u2019ll allow us to make the step forward we need to continue fighting for points. We\u2019re have shown we can do it and that we can fight towards the front, and I am confident we can achieve that again in Australia.\u201d Alessandro Alunni Bravi, Team Representative \u201cStarting where we were on the grid, we were expecting to fight for the points, but, unfortunately, we weren\u2019t able to finish in the top ten this time around. The team had a difficult weekend, and we weren\u2019t able to be at the level for which we aimed: we\u2019ll need to go back to base, analyse the data from this performance and understand where we\u2019ve fallen short, and what steps we need to make to return to the level we were in Bahrain. We are confident we can make it there in Melbourne, where we will also bring some updates to further improve the performance of our C43. We need to keep working hard, of course: the season is long and the battle will be intense in each race.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari prepares to drive on the grid prior to the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 19, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Both had to immediately pit for replacement front wings, and both dropped to the back as a result. From there the race was more about gathering data and getting Piastri more used to F1 machinery in race conditions, but the two were allowed to fight at one point, with Piastri managing to make his way past his team mate despite being on the same set of tyres from the end of the first lap to the finish. Lando Norris, 17th \"Tough race, we were very unlucky today. I had a really good start but then got hit with debris which damaged my front wing. We did our best to try to come out with something, but no luck was on our side. We did the best job we could, working as a team, but it was difficult to achieve anything more than what we did. So, it\u2019s tough, but now our focus is on Australia where we hope to do a better job.\" Oscar Piastri, 15th \"Obviously it\u2019s not the day we were looking for, there was contact at the beginning where I lost part of my front wing. I\u2019m not sure if there was anything I could have done really, I was squeezed a little bit. There was some good racing at the end, which was nice and obviously I did a long stint on the Hards, so it\u2019s good to get a bit of learning for the tyres but overall, it\u2019s not what we were looking for tonight.\" Andrea Stella, Team Principal \"After beginning the race with high hopes of scoring points, we had both cars at the back of the pack after the first lap and we come away from Jeddah empty-handed. Oscar had contact at the first corner, which required him to pit with a broken front wing, while Lando hit the debris coming off Oscar\u2019s car and also suffered a broken front wing. \"We\u2019re racers, we take these things on the chin, and we will be even more determined to succeed when we get to Australia. Before we go to Melbourne, we know we have work to do to improve our car, and that will be our immediate focus.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Oscar Piastri of Australia driving the (81) McLaren MCL60 Mercedes on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 19, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

He had to complete an extra lap of the track to scrub enough speed to actually make it into the pit lane, managing the problem astutely to make sure he got back to his garage in one piece. That left Sargeant to fly the flag for the team and he ran 12th for a chunk of the evening, before losing out to fellow rookies De Vries and Sargeant in the last few laps. Logan Sargeant, 16th \"Today I struggled a bit more than yesterday. The first 30 laps or so were pretty good and then I just struggled there at the end to keep a hold of the tyres, we were losing a lot of grip. Nevertheless, we made it through another one and learned a lot. I definitely feel more confident ahead of the next race. I showed this weekend that on a difficult track I can be really quick, so I can take that going into Melbourne and hopefully replicate and keep improving. Over the past two races I\u2019ve learned an enormous amount; I feel like everything is becoming more natural and I\u2019m trying to get things to become second nature and keep implementing them. It\u2019s not going to happen all at once, it\u2019s more a case of constantly building and understanding better.\" Alex Albon, DNF \"It was a frustrating day, as this weekend we felt really strong as a team and I\u2019ve been really impressed with where the car is compared to where we were last year. It\u2019s been such a pleasure getting to drive the car and unfortunately when it mattered in qualifying, we couldn\u2019t quite execute, followed by the issue in the race, so it\u2019s frustrating as we could have scored points this weekend. I\u2019d much rather be disappointed, knowing the car has got pace than just finishing at the back, so it\u2019s a different kind of disappointment with lots of positives and the opportunity to turn it around and come back fighting.\" Dave Robson, Head of Vehicle Performance \"The pace was good today and Alex had a good chance of finishing in the top 10. Unfortunately, he was forced to retire with an issue in the mechanical brake system, which we will investigate and fix before the next race. This is a shame as a lot of good work was done here and in Grove on Friday evening to prepare the cars for the race. \"Logan\u2019s race was compromised by the Safety Car, which left him with a lengthy stint on the Medium tyre and a defensive race against a close group of cars. He eventually lost a few places to faster cars but gave a good performance in his 2nd Formula 1 race. \"We can take a lot of positives away from this weekend but at the same time we missed a good opportunity to score some more points and we must make some improvements to succeed in a very tight midfield.\"\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Alexander Albon of Thailand driving the (23) Williams FW45 Mercedes locks a wheel under braking in front of Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari during the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 19, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Today out on track was about finetuning things, we had a positive day but there are still quite a few things we can do better. On the long runs we all seemed fairly close to each other but it&#8217;s more because of managing the tyres because they don&#8217;t really let you push around here at the moment.

On top of that, Leclerc was struggling with small reliability gremlins in the form of paddle shift issues, while Sainz was baulked by traffic and neither driver managed a fully clean push lap in the representative evening conditions on the soft tyre.

We will continue to go into the details overnight and focus on improving the balance of the car to make it easier to drive. It's a tough car to drive but I know everyone is working so hard at the factory.

We will be aiming to maximise the package we have got and get the set-up in the sweet spot. As much as we would love to, given all the hard work everyone is putting in, we know we won't find one second overnight. Red Bull are clearly out in front, but we are learning lots about our car. These learnings will help us in both the short and medium-term. As is always the case in practice sessions too, we're not sure what power modes everyone was running so we will know more tomorrow.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director</strong></p>\n<p>\"After Bahrain, we came here with realistic expectations. While the team back in the UK is working hard on developing us to a better place, our focus has been to maximise the potential of what we currently have. There were a couple of scheduled upgrades that look to be working OK but while taking us in the right direction, they are not a huge step. The sessions themselves went smoothly; we were struggling with the front end in the first session and may have over-corrected for the second session. Nevertheless, we've got plenty of information to pick through to work out the setup for tomorrow. The pace when we get the lap together didn't look too bad, but the car hasn't been easy enough to drive so that's something we'll look to improve tomorrow ahead of qualifying.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 17: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 17: George Russell of Great Britain driving the (63) Mercedes AMG\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 17: Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain driving the (44) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W14 on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 17, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Gasly pipped his team mate in FP1 before Ocon returned the favour in the evening session, although his eye-catching P4 was suspected to have been achieved thanks to a lower fuel load than some of his rivals.</p>\n<p><strong>Esteban Ocon - FP1: 1:31.181, P12; FP2: 1:30.039, P4</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nice to come back to a track like Jeddah as it&#8217;s a really fast and thrilling street circuit, which forces everyone to be on their toes at all times. Our Friday was productive where we tried different things, which will help us in both Qualifying and Race conditions. So far, the car feels strong, and I think there is more we can extract ahead of tomorrow evening&#8217;s Qualifying. The team did a great job today to get through the programme and we will be working hard tonight to be in a good place for tomorrow. All in all, it&#8217;s been a good day at the office.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Pierre Gasly - FP1: 1:30.949, P8; FP2: 1:30.100, P6</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great to be back here in Jeddah at this very fast and exciting race track. It&#8217;s been a busy day for us as we continue to learn about our 2023 package and, I must say, I&#8217;ve been pleased with today&#8217;s work. After two weeks in Bahrain, it&#8217;s nice to be taking on a new track and a new challenge. It&#8217;s very high-speed here and there&#8217;s a lot you have to get right to be quick. The car feels good, we have a good idea on the set-up direction we want to take and there&#8217;s more to come from us this weekend. My focus is on working hard with the engineers to make sure we&#8217;re well prepared for Qualifying and returning with a better performance than we showed last time out.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Pat Fry, Chief Technical Officer</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a reasonable Friday Practice for the team today here in Jeddah for the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix. For us, it&#8217;s been interesting to see the car on a completely different circuit to what we&#8217;ve seen so far this year, as the characteristics here steer towards lower downforce with lots of high-speed corners. We&#8217;re pleased with our work today with both drivers offering similar feedback on the directions to take on set-up, which leaves us in decent shape for the rest of the weekend. We have plenty of data to work through to prepare ourselves for tomorrow&#8217;s Qualifying where we aim for a much-improved performance from Bahrain to set ourselves up for a better Race on Sunday. A solid start with more to come.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 17: (L) Pierre Gasly of France driving the (10) Alpine F1 A523 Renault\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 17: Esteban Ocon of France driving the (31) Alpine F1 A523 Renault on\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 17: (L) Pierre Gasly of France driving the (10) Alpine F1 A523 Renault alongside Oscar Piastri of Australia driving the (81) McLaren MCL60 Mercedes during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 17, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

He&#8217;d surely take that result come qualifying tomorrow, but with engine modes yet to be turned up, much could still change. As for Magnussen, he wound up down the order in both sessions on a subdued day for the Dane.</p>\n<p><strong>Nico Hulkenberg - FP1: 1:31.552, P15; FP2: 1:30.181, P8</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We had a smooth Friday &#8211; no major incidents, situations, or problems. Like always, you learn about the car, the tyres and where the balance is. Certainly, again over one lap I think we seem to be competitive and long runs could be a bit more challenging for us, so that&#8217;s where our focus is now. It&#8217;s all about pace, tyre degradation and being quick in the right places &#8211; we need to analyse and consider it all to come up with the best strategy.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Magnussen &#8211; FP1: 1:31.566, P16; FP2: 1:30.820, P15</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was good, we got through FP1 and FP2 fine but there&#8217;s lot of work to do on Friday night as always. The field is tight again just like in Bahrain and there&#8217;s a lot to fight for tomorrow. It&#8217;s a very different track, different speeds, and it&#8217;s hard to compare but there&#8217;s new challenges.

It&#8217;s a very quick circuit, which is a lot of fun and I think we&#8217;re getting there. The long run pace seemed to be okay, but I think we need to have a look at the one-lap pace.

We worked through our plan, which was based around understanding which tyres are most suitable for the race, while also answering questions regarding our approach to qualifying. We had no significant problems during the sessions, though there&#8217;s obviously a bit of work to do, extracting performance from the MCL60. This will be our focus overnight. We&#8217;ve generated plenty of data to study, and we hope to be in good shape to race for points on Sunday.\"</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 17: Lando Norris of Great Britain driving the (4) McLaren MCL60\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 17: Oscar Piastri of Australia driving the (81) McLaren MCL60 Mercedes\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 17: Lando Norris of Great Britain driving the (4) McLaren MCL60 Mercedes on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 17, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

They were expecting this track to suit their car more than Bahrain, and it certainly looked like it might do with Albon in the top 10 in the opening session. But in the representative conditions he fell down the order somewhat &#8211; although he did go for his soft-shod run earlier than some, and before the track had fully evolved.</p>\n<p><strong>Logan Sargeant - FP1: 1:31.922, P17; FP2: 1:30.959, P18</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I think for the first day in Jeddah, it went pretty smoothly, with everything going according to plan,&#8221; Sarge reacted, after placing P17 and P18 across both sessions. The pace doesn't look too bad as a team and hopefully we can continue to build on that. It's definitely a tricky and challenging circuit but I'm enjoying it, so hopefully I can continue to keep pushing and find a little bit more time tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Alex Albon - FP1: 1:31.030, P9; FP2: 1:30.810, P14</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it's been a very positive day and we've definitely got pace in the car, so I'm feeling optimistic. We're missing a little bit of set-up during FP2 for our qualifying simulation but everything else feels pretty good. I don't want to speak too soon but I'm feeling good with the car so let's see how it goes.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Dave Robson, Head of Vehicle Performance</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Like in Bahrain, the conditions change quite a lot between FP1 and FP2. Following a good FP1, we didn&#8217;t quite get the changes right for the cooler evening session. However, we were doing some experiments, which gave interesting results.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is clear what we need to do, and we already have enough experience of the FW45 that we are confident we can get it all together for qualifying tomorrow. We appear to be in a tight group of teams, and we will need to maximise everything tomorrow. It won&#8217;t be easy but there is no reason we can&#8217;t do it so that both drivers get an excellent chance of a strong qualifying session.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Whatever happens in qualifying, we had decent long run pace today, overtaking is easier than in Bahrain and we will be looking to increase our points tally on Sunday.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 17: Alexander Albon of Thailand driving the (23) Williams FW45\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 17: Logan Sargeant of United States driving the (2) Williams FW45\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 17: Alexander Albon of Thailand driving the (23) Williams FW45 Mercedes on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 17, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Tsunoda finished ahead of his team mate in both sessions, which was no surprise given De Vries is the only driver never to have raced at this track. He will have plenty of homework to do tonight to try and get up to speed here.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.alphatauri-boss-tost-jokes-i-dont-trust-engineers-after-point-less-start-to.3tKOJU3CeyFvkd0wM09FMv.html\">READ MORE: AlphaTauri boss Tost jokes 'I don't trust engineers' after point-less start to season</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Nyck de Vries - FP1: 1:31.450, P13; FP2: 1:30.921, P17</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was my first time driving the track here in Jeddah, it's fun to learn and quick to drive. It is a challenge, but I like driving the track. Our day was productive. The midfield is just super close, as there are only a couple of tenths between P11 and P20, so we&#8217;ll have to see what happens tomorrow. It can easily go in a good or bad way, therefore, we will make sure to be on top of our game to extract the maximum for qualifying tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Yuki Tsunoda - FP1: 1:31.110, P10; FP2: 1:30.776, P13</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;The circuit is safer in terms of visibility, though the characteristics haven&#8217;t changed much. What we&#8217;ve seen from practice today is that we are slightly behind those consistently fighting for P10, but we still have one more day to put it all together. There were no major issues during FP1 and FP2, but we know that we have to find more performance in the car. Even if Q3 is the target, Q2 is more possible tomorrow than it was in Bahrain last week. In the end, we&#8217;ll analyse all our data tonight to see how we can improve our performance. Tyre degradation doesn&#8217;t seem as bad as expected, so we can push flat out.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Jonathan Eddolls, Chief Race Engineer</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of analysis had been completed by the engineers between Bahrain and this event, which led to some interesting directions to try with the set-up at this track. Saudi Arabia's characteristics are quite different, in particular, with the requirement for a more efficient car and good performance in high-speed. In some ways, we expected this to suit our car better. The focus in FP1 for Nyck was to complete as many laps as possible, given that it&#8217;s his first time driving here. For Yuki, we had a number of aero tests to complete, so we had to sacrifice some time in the garage to complete these; but they are important to help with development. Similar to Bahrain, the first session of the day was considerably hotter than the second, so we needed to take what we learned and apply that to the lower temperatures in FP2. The wind dropped considerably between sessions, which made the car more consistent. FP2 was all about understanding how to maximise the short-run performance on the Soft tyre. We weren&#8217;t able to get it on the first timed lap, but we will work overnight to try to improve this. Then the focus shifted to the graining on the softer compounds, which was a massive issue from 2022. We appear to have made a step, so we now need to take all of the data gathered today and figure out the optimum strategy and tyre choice for Sunday. Overall, we were satisfied with the day, the midfield is very compact, but we think we have a car that is able to compete in that group here.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 17: Yuki Tsunoda of Scuderia AlphaTauri and Japan  during practice\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        <img alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 17: Nyck de Vries of Scuderia AlphaTauri and The Netherlands  during\" class=\"swiper-lazy\">\n                        <p class=\"swiper-lazy-preloader\"></p>\n                    \n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-right\">Next</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"peek-area gallery-prev\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-arrow-left\">Previous</i>\n                </a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-link\" title=\"Enlarge\"><p class=\"icon icon-full-screen\"></p></a>\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"gallery-enlarge gallery-enlarge-hitarea\"><p>Enlarge</p></a>\n            <p class=\"gallery-pagination f1--xs f1-color--gray5\">\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n                    <p class=\"current-image-num\">1</p> / <p class=\"total-images-num\">2</p>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"gallery-description current\">JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 17: Yuki Tsunoda of Scuderia AlphaTauri and Japan  during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 17, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

We did a lot of work today, trying different wing levels and setup options, and now we need to sit down, look at the data and make some decisions on which are the right calls. Of course, we are not yet where we want to be and at the levels we showed in Bahrain, when we were the fifth fastest team: we need to find a bit more pace still, make a step forward ahead of qualifying. But it&#8217;s only Friday and I&#8217;m confident we can do it when it really matters. The field is very close, as expected, and with a small gain there is no reason we cannot make up places in qualifying. We&#8217;ll work hard tonight &#8211; I don&#8217;t think Q3 is out of reach, and we&#8217;ll give our best shot at it tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Zhou Guanyu - FP1: 1:31.986, P19; FP2: 1:30.837, P16</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a busy day in the car: we are not too far off from our rivals when it comes to pace, although I can say we expected a little bit more from today. We tried different settings, switching things and making changes, and I effectively drove a significantly different car between the first and the second session: it took some adapting, but the team now has all the data we need to make the best decisions when it comes to setup. Of course, every weekend we aim for Q3, and it&#8217;s a matter of how much we can get out from myself and from the car &#8211; especially when the margins are so small.

As expected, FP1 wasn&#8217;t particularly representative in terms of tyre behaviour, characterised by notably high track evolution. On a track that was completely different to the opening round in Sakhir, the teams concentrated on car setup for the most part. The FP2 session was much more relevant, with nearly all the drivers focussing on the medium and the soft tyres. The main theme for tyres last year was managing front degradation, which was mainly down to degradation. The first analysis of the long runs indicates that this year&#8217;s new construction that was designed to reduce understeer, along with the better overall balance of the 2023 cars, has practically eliminated graining on the hard and medium. There&#8217;s still some graining on the soft &#8211; especially on the front-right tyre &#8211; but this doesn&#8217;t significantly influence performance over long runs. The constantly evolving track conditions and improvements to the setup that teams will make in FP3 suggest that a one-stop strategy using medium and soft is most likely for the race, also because there&#8217;s a relatively small performance gap of 0.4 seconds between these two compounds, which makes both valid options for the race.\"</p>\n\n    </div>",

What we\u2019ve seen from practice today is that we are slightly behind those consistently fighting for P10, but we still have one more day to put it all together. There were no major issues during FP1 and FP2, but we know that we have to find more performance in the car. Even if Q3 is the target, Q2 is more possible tomorrow than it was in Bahrain last week. In the end, we\u2019ll analyse all our data tonight to see how we can improve our performance. Tyre degradation doesn\u2019t seem as bad as expected, so we can push flat out.\u201d Jonathan Eddolls, Chief Race Engineer \u201cA lot of analysis had been completed by the engineers between Bahrain and this event, which led to some interesting directions to try with the set-up at this track. Saudi Arabia's characteristics are quite different, in particular, with the requirement for a more efficient car and good performance in high-speed. In some ways, we expected this to suit our car better. The focus in FP1 for Nyck was to complete as many laps as possible, given that it\u2019s his first time driving here. For Yuki, we had a number of aero tests to complete, so we had to sacrifice some time in the garage to complete these; but they are important to help with development. Similar to Bahrain, the first session of the day was considerably hotter than the second, so we needed to take what we learned and apply that to the lower temperatures in FP2. The wind dropped considerably between sessions, which made the car more consistent. FP2 was all about understanding how to maximise the short-run performance on the Soft tyre. We weren\u2019t able to get it on the first timed lap, but we will work overnight to try to improve this. Then the focus shifted to the graining on the softer compounds, which was a massive issue from 2022. We appear to have made a step, so we now need to take all of the data gathered today and figure out the optimum strategy and tyre choice for Sunday. Overall, we were satisfied with the day, the midfield is very compact, but we think we have a car that is able to compete in that group here.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 17: Yuki Tsunoda of Scuderia AlphaTauri and Japan during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 17, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

FULL TRANSCRIPT: Read every word from four-time world champion Alain Prost's insightful Beyond the Grid interview Valtteri Bottas - FP1: 1:31.970, P18; FP2: 1:31.052, P20 \u201cThe first feeling with the car is quite ok: we didn\u2019t have any issues with the balance, and we have a solid basis to build on. We did a lot of work today, trying different wing levels and setup options, and now we need to sit down, look at the data and make some decisions on which are the right calls. Of course, we are not yet where we want to be and at the levels we showed in Bahrain, when we were the fifth fastest team: we need to find a bit more pace still, make a step forward ahead of qualifying. But it\u2019s only Friday and I\u2019m confident we can do it when it really matters. The field is very close, as expected, and with a small gain there is no reason we cannot make up places in qualifying. We\u2019ll work hard tonight \u2013 I don\u2019t think Q3 is out of reach, and we\u2019ll give our best shot at it tomorrow.\u201d Zhou Guanyu - FP1: 1:31.986, P19; FP2: 1:30.837, P16 \u201cIt was a busy day in the car: we are not too far off from our rivals when it comes to pace, although I can say we expected a little bit more from today. We tried different settings, switching things and making changes, and I effectively drove a significantly different car between the first and the second session: it took some adapting, but the team now has all the data we need to make the best decisions when it comes to setup. Of course, every weekend we aim for Q3, and it\u2019s a matter of how much we can get out from myself and from the car \u2013 especially when the margins are so small. There is still some work to do overnight, but I am confident we can get in the mix and fight for good positions in qualifying tomorrow.\u201d\n\nNext Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 17: Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C43 Ferrari on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 17, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Although it races under the American flag and is owned by an American, Gene Haas, the team&#8217;s primary F1 base is in the UK. Its chassis is built in Italy. So are its engine, suspension, and brakes. Team boss Guenther Steiner is Italian.

And is the idea of an all-American effort, given F1&#8217;s European roots, really feasible?</p><h2><b>&#8216;The American global team&#8217;</b></h2><p>The addition of Haas to the grid back in 2016 was a big deal for F1 in the United States. It was the first time there had been an American team since 1986 (the unrelated Haas Lola squad), and it was seen as a big step forward for the sport&#8217;s US footprint.</p><p>But from the outset, team boss Guenther Steiner never wanted to do things just because it was the &#8220;American&#8221; way. There was no pressure to sign an American driver just because it fit the narrative or to stray from the proven formula of the European outfits. As Steiner put it to <i>The Athletic</i>: &#8220;It&#8217;s about doing what&#8217;s best.&#8221;</p><p>That was why the team set up shop in Banbury, England, taking over an empty F1 factory, and sought talent from the existing European racing scene. It established partnerships with Ferrari for technical support and Italian chassis designer Dallara to help it be competitive from the jump. Although it has ties to the American Haas base in Kannapolis, North Carolina, the racing operation itself was and remains chiefly Euro-centric.</p><p>&#8220;We do business where it&#8217;s best to do business,&#8221; said Steiner. &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to be stubborn, (saying) I&#8217;m in one country and do nothing else. No, you need to be thinking globally.&#8221;</p><p>That global approach does not mean Haas rejects its American identity.

If you do bad, you don&#8217;t make America proud.&#8221;</p><h2><b>Leaning into the US identity</b></h2><p>The addition of Haas to the grid in 2016 predated F1&#8217;s American boom, fueled by Netflix&#8217;s &#8220;Drive to Survive&#8221; and the modernization of the series by Liberty Media, which acquired the commercial rights to the sport in 2017. But as more and more US fans flock to F1, more opportunities open up for Haas as the only American team.</p><p>That sprouted a conscious effort to lean into its US identity, particularly last season when Haas started exploring new title sponsors. After splitting with Russian state-linked company Uralkali in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, Haas had no shortage of American interest.</p><p>It landed sponsorships from Chipotle and clothing brand TravisMathew and found its new title sponsor in MoneyGram, a worldwide money transfer company based in Dallas. Steiner found similarities in their approaches &#8211; like Haas, the sponsors are proudly American with a very global outlook. &#8220;It&#8217;s still an American company,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But they want to grow outside of the States.&#8221;</p><p>MoneyGram also liked the characteristics it saw in Haas, which chief marketing officer Greg Hall told <i>The Athletic</i> were &#8220;so innately American&#8221;: a fellow startup operation trying to make a big impact with an underdog spirit. &#8220;That&#8217;s the American dream, right?&#8221;</p><p>MoneyGram CEO Alex Holmes acknowledged the unique appeal of Haas, particularly in F1&#8217;s current period of growth. &#8220;The fact we can associate ourselves with the only American team and collectively push for Formula 1 to be bigger in the US adds a lot of value,&#8221; he said.</p><img class=\"wp-image-4493518 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/05/05200339/GettyImages-1252647442.jpg\" alt=\"Haas F1 Team's Danish driver Kevin Magnussen walks in the Paddock at the Miami International Autodrome ahead of the Miami Grand Prix, in Miami Gardens, Florida, on May 4, 2023.\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1703\"><span class=\"table-cell-span\"><p class=\"credits-image\"></p></span><p class=\"credits-text\">Kevin Magnussen and Haas are never far from the spotlight this week in Miami.
