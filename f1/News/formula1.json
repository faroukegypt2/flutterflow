Not only can we help show you where to watch the British Formula 1 GP live, but this week's race options are free and include an English commentary option. Usually, all the free F1 live streams are found in Austria, Belgium, and so on. And they're still on this week, of course, but the UK's Channel 4 is keeping up the fine tradition of showing the British F1 live stream for free.\n\nWe've listed all the free countries below, but if you're not in one of those countries, you'll need to use a VPN (virtual private network) to watch along.

Better yet, you can save up to 49% and get an extra three months for free today.\n\nAre there extended highlights later?\n\nIn the UK, Channel 4 has an extended highlights show a few hours after the race at 11:50 p.m. BST (6:50 p.m. ET). Coverage lasts two hours, so it feels like you're effectively seeing the whole race with only a few time-saving edits. You can tune in on the Channel 4 website online and use a VPN as outlined above to watch from outside the UK. If you're not free to watch it at this time, it will be available on-demand for free on the site, probably the day after. Although, the on-demand option is sometimes a shortened version, lasting just over an hour some weeks and closer to two hours on others.\n\nThis highlights show isn't just a one-off for the British GP, by the way. It's on every race weekend and is a great free option for English commentary if you can avoid the race result from earlier in the day.\n\nHow to watch an F1 live stream in the US\n\nESPN carries coverage of Formula 1 racing throughout the season, and there's plenty of it left to enjoy too. If you don't already have access to the channel, there are a couple of cord-cutting options for you to consider. Sling TV's Orange tier is usually $40 a month, but a special offer now sees that first month's price slashed to just $15.\n\nFubo TV also has ESPN but is much more expensive at $74.99 monthly. It's packed with channels, though, and is a favorite amongst cord-cutting sports fans. Better yet, you can get a 7-day free trial, so enjoy the race for free and cancel your sub before the week is up if you don't want to keep it.\n\nDeal icon An icon in the shape of a lightning bolt. Deal Sling TV Subscription Sling is one of the most affordable live TV streaming services you can sign up for. New members can now receive their first month for a discounted rate of just $20. Shop at Sling\n\nFubo TV (Pro Plan) FuboTV is one of the lesser-known streaming services, but it's worth considering for those who love entertainment and non-traditional sports programming. It's pricey, but there is currently a 7-day free trial, so you can take it for a spin first.\n\nNote: Using VPNs is illegal in certain countries, and using VPNs to access region-locked streaming content might constitute a breach of the terms of use for certain services. Insider does not endorse or condone the illegal use of VPNs.",

Last year, Carlos Sainz won this race, his lone win of the 2022 season and the third of three wins last season for Ferrari. Lewis Hamilton has been dominant here in the past, winning eight times on this circuit, most recently in 2o21.</p>\n<p>F1 was last in action last weekend in Austria, with Max Verstappen winning once again. It's become routine at this point, with Verstappen winning five races in a row and seven of the nine races this season. The only times he didn't win? He finished second, behind only his Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez. Just domination from the two-time world champion, who is cruising to a third title.</p>\n<p>Below you will find our <strong>Formula 1 DraftKings DFS lineup picks for the British Grand Prix on 7/9/23, </strong>with the slate locking at <strong>9:00 a.m. ET</strong>. If you have any questions or want to talk about Formula 1, you can find me on Twitter at <a title=\"\" href=\"https://twitter.com/juscarts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@juscarts</a>.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p><p class=\"code-block code-block-3\">\n\n</p>\n<h2><p id=\"How_Does_Formula_1_Fantasy_Work\">How Does Formula 1 Fantasy Work?</p></h2>\n<p>Here's how the scoring and format work for F1 DFS on DraftKings. You'll pick five drivers and a constructor. One of those drivers will be your captain, who earns you 1.5 times the points but also costs 1.5 times as much as they usually cost. For the constructor, you're choosing one of the F1 teams.</p>\n<p>So here's how the scoring works. Your driver only gets points if they finish in the top 10. Here's a chart for how that breaks down:</p>\n\n\n\nFinishing Spot\nDraftKings Points\n\n\n\n\n1\n25\n\n\n2\n18\n\n\n3\n15\n\n\n4\n12\n\n\n5\n10\n\n\n6\n8\n\n\n7\n6\n\n\n8\n4\n\n\n9\n2\n\n\n10\n1\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, the driver with the fastest lap of the race gets three points. You get 0.1 points per lap led, five points for beating your teammate, one point for being classified at the finish (finished 90% of the race, essentially), and points for place differential.</p>\n<p>Finish three spots higher than your grid position and you get two points. Finish five better and you get three points. Finish 10 better to get five points. You also lose points for a negative place differential, starting at three spots.</p><p class=\"code-block code-block-4\">\n\n</p>\n<p>The constructor points work the same way, with some added points if both cars do well.</p>\n<p>It's confusing, but for Formula 1 DFS to work, it probably had to be confusing.</p>\n<p>Now that we've gone over that, let's talk drivers. Here's what I've put together as a kind of base lineup.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p><p class=\"code-block code-block-5\">\n\n</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Captain_Lando_Norris_10200\">Captain: Lando Norris ($10,200)</p></h2>\n<p>Starts Second</p>\n<p>Norris just keeps qualifying well, as this marks the fourth race in a row he's been seventh or better on the grid. His season-high second-place starting spot puts Norris in a good position to contend for his best finish of the year and, potentially, his first podium since Imola last year.</p>\n<p></p><p>One concern is that Norris hasn't always put the best race together after a strong start. He had issues at Spain and Canada, dropping him outside the top 10. But he finally put it together last weekend in Austria, qualifying fourth and finishing fourth, though DraftKings credits him with a fifth-place finish because it marked Carlos Sainz down as finishing fourth before he was later hit with a time penalty that dropped him to sixth.</p><p class=\"code-block code-block-6\">\n\n</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Constructor_McLaren_5200\">Constructor: McLaren ($5,200)</p></h2>\n<p>I already discussed why Norris is my captain pick above. Now, let's talk about why McLaren as a whole is my constructor pick. First, value. This team has shown a lot of speed lately, but McLaren as a whole is only $5,200. There's a huge jump from this team to Aston Martin, the fourth-highest-priced constructor, at $8,300.</p>\n<p>Part of why they're priced like they are? Oscar Piastri hasn't been as quick as Norris. The first-year driver has finished outside the points in three consecutive races, and his best result all year was just eighth.</p>\n<p>But Piastri has his best start of the season here, as he qualified third. McLaren looks like the No. 2 team this weekend&#8212;if there's a week to bet on McLaren as a whole finishing well, this is the week.</p><p class=\"code-block code-block-7\">\n\n</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Max_Verstappen_15000\">Max Verstappen ($15,000)</p></h2>\n<p>Starts First</p>\n<p>Yeah, we've got to make room in our lineup for Max Verstappen, who is chasing his sixth consecutive Formula 1 victory. And there's not really much else to say here&#8212;he's in a class of his own and the only car capable of beating him straight up is his teammate, who'll start this race in 16th place. Who's touching Verstappen?</p>\n<p></p><p class=\"code-block code-block-8\">\n\n</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Paulo Dybala presenting the pole trophy to Max Verstappen at Silverstone &#9917;&#65039;&#129309;&#127937; <a href=\"https://t.co/7BJZyoNAh7\">pic.twitter.com/7BJZyoNAh7</a></p>&#8212; ESPN F1 (@ESPNF1) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESPNF1/status/1677702220911869957?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 8, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<p>Really, the only anti-Verstappen argument aside from \"his salary is too high\" is that if you fade him and he has some kind of mechanical issue, you'll end up probably in the money just because so many other lineups have him. That's a viable move in GPPs, but in head-to-head contests you really can't risk not playing Verstappen with how his 2023 season has gone.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Charles_Leclerc_10200\">Charles Leclerc ($10,200)</p></h2>\n<p>Starts Fourth</p>\n<p>Leclerc rolls off fourth, and I think it's reasonable to think he'll be running third by the end of the first lap&#8212;no offense to Oscar Piastri, who starts third, but my money is on Leclerc finding a way around him.</p><p class=\"code-block code-block-9\">\n\n</p>\n<p>This has been a good track for Leclerc, who has three podiums in six starts. He led 49 laps here in 2021 before Lewis Hamilton got past him late and he wound up second, and his worst finish in his last five starts here is fourth. Barring some kind of issue with the car, hard to not see Leclerc finish fourth or better again on Sunday.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Alexander_Albon_5200\">Alexander Albon ($5,200)</p></h2>\n<p>Starts Eighth</p>\n<p>Feel like I say this every week, but if you want a guaranteed five points for defeating your teammate, then Alexander Albon is the man for your DraftKings lineup.</p><p class=\"code-block code-block-10\">\n\n\n</p>\n<p></p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Alex Albon has now reached Q3 3x in a row, making it his 4th Q3 this year! <a href=\"https://t.co/VCNHo6Lgo0\">pic.twitter.com/VCNHo6Lgo0</a></p>&#8212; leo&#128011; (@albonscar) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/albonscar/status/1677694852228579329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 8, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<p>Albon finished 11th last week, just missing out on his second consecutive finish in the points. He was ahead of teammate Logan Sargeant for the sixth race in a row. I'm not sure Albon will have the car under him to stay in the top 10, but I'm confident that if he's running at the finish of this race, you're getting at least five points from him. That's worth something.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Nico_Hulkenberg_4200\">Nico Hulkenberg ($4,200)</p></h2>\n<p>Starts 11th</p><p class=\"code-block code-block-11\">\n\n</p>\n<p>Every week, I say \"Justin, stop recommending Haas drivers,\" and then every week I keep doing it. Hulkenberg, who starts 11th this week, is coming off a string of three races with a top 10 starting spot, and his best finish in any of those races was 15th.</p>\n<p>But I think there's some upside here. Less chances for negative place differential since he starts in 11th, which is one plus, and then he also has a big early edge over his teammate in the race for the five points for defeating your teammate, as Kevin Magnussen fires off 20th.</p>\n<a></a><a></a><br><br>\nJordan McAbee joins the team in 2023 with his exclusive NASCAR DFS projections and algorithm-predicted finishing order!

If you have any questions or want to talk about Formula 1, you can find me on Twitter at @juscarts.\n\nHow Does Formula 1 Fantasy Work?\n\nHere's how the scoring and format work for F1 DFS on DraftKings. You'll pick five drivers and a constructor. One of those drivers will be your captain, who earns you 1.5 times the points but also costs 1.5 times as much as they usually cost. For the constructor, you're choosing one of the F1 teams.\n\nSo here's how the scoring works. Your driver only gets points if they finish in the top 10. Here's a chart for how that breaks down:\n\nFinishing Spot DraftKings Points 1 25 2 18 3 15 4 12 5 10 6 8 7 6 8 4 9 2 10 1\n\nIn addition, the driver with the fastest lap of the race gets three points. You get 0.1 points per lap led, five points for beating your teammate, one point for being classified at the finish (finished 90% of the race, essentially), and points for place differential.\n\nFinish three spots higher than your grid position and you get two points. Finish five better and you get three points. Finish 10 better to get five points. You also lose points for a negative place differential, starting at three spots.\n\nThe constructor points work the same way, with some added points if both cars do well.\n\nIt's confusing, but for Formula 1 DFS to work, it probably had to be confusing.\n\nNow that we've gone over that, let's talk drivers. Here's what I've put together as a kind of base lineup.\n\nCaptain: Lando Norris ($10,200)\n\nStarts Second\n\nNorris just keeps qualifying well, as this marks the fourth race in a row he's been seventh or better on the grid. His season-high second-place starting spot puts Norris in a good position to contend for his best finish of the year and, potentially, his first podium since Imola last year.\n\nOne concern is that Norris hasn't always put the best race together after a strong start. He had issues at Spain and Canada, dropping him outside the top 10. But he finally put it together last weekend in Austria, qualifying fourth and finishing fourth, though DraftKings credits him with a fifth-place finish because it marked Carlos Sainz down as finishing fourth before he was later hit with a time penalty that dropped him to sixth.\n\nConstructor: McLaren ($5,200)\n\nI already discussed why Norris is my captain pick above. Now, let's talk about why McLaren as a whole is my constructor pick. First, value. This team has shown a lot of speed lately, but McLaren as a whole is only $5,200. There's a huge jump from this team to Aston Martin, the fourth-highest-priced constructor, at $8,300.\n\nPart of why they're priced like they are? Oscar Piastri hasn't been as quick as Norris. The first-year driver has finished outside the points in three consecutive races, and his best result all year was just eighth.\n\nBut Piastri has his best start of the season here, as he qualified third. McLaren looks like the No. 2 team this weekend\u2014if there's a week to bet on McLaren as a whole finishing well, this is the week.\n\nMax Verstappen ($15,000)\n\nStarts First\n\nYeah, we've got to make room in our lineup for Max Verstappen, who is chasing his sixth consecutive Formula 1 victory. And there's not really much else to say here\u2014he's in a class of his own and the only car capable of beating him straight up is his teammate, who'll start this race in 16th place. Who's touching Verstappen?\n\nPaulo Dybala presenting the pole trophy to Max Verstappen at Silverstone \u26bd\ufe0f\ud83e\udd1d\ud83c\udfc1 pic.twitter.com/7BJZyoNAh7 \u2014 ESPN F1 (@ESPNF1) July 8, 2023\n\nReally, the only anti-Verstappen argument aside from \"his salary is too high\" is that if you fade him and he has some kind of mechanical issue, you'll end up probably in the money just because so many other lineups have him. That's a viable move in GPPs, but in head-to-head contests you really can't risk not playing Verstappen with how his 2023 season has gone.\n\nCharles Leclerc ($10,200)\n\nStarts Fourth\n\nLeclerc rolls off fourth, and I think it's reasonable to think he'll be running third by the end of the first lap\u2014no offense to Oscar Piastri, who starts third, but my money is on Leclerc finding a way around him.\n\nThis has been a good track for Leclerc, who has three podiums in six starts. He led 49 laps here in 2021 before Lewis Hamilton got past him late and he wound up second, and his worst finish in his last five starts here is fourth. Barring some kind of issue with the car, hard to not see Leclerc finish fourth or better again on Sunday.\n\nAlexander Albon ($5,200)\n\nStarts Eighth\n\nFeel like I say this every week, but if you want a guaranteed five points for defeating your teammate, then Alexander Albon is the man for your DraftKings lineup.\n\nAlex Albon has now reached Q3 3x in a row, making it his 4th Q3 this year! pic.twitter.com/VCNHo6Lgo0 \u2014 leo\ud83d\udc0b (@albonscar) July 8, 2023\n\nAlbon finished 11th last week, just missing out on his second consecutive finish in the points. He was ahead of teammate Logan Sargeant for the sixth race in a row. I'm not sure Albon will have the car under him to stay in the top 10, but I'm confident that if he's running at the finish of this race, you're getting at least five points from him. That's worth something.\n\nNico Hulkenberg ($4,200)\n\nStarts 11th\n\nEvery week, I say \"Justin, stop recommending Haas drivers,\" and then every week I keep doing it. Hulkenberg, who starts 11th this week, is coming off a string of three races with a top 10 starting spot, and his best finish in any of those races was 15th.\n\nBut I think there's some upside here. Less chances for negative place differential since he starts in 11th, which is one plus, and then he also has a big early edge over his teammate in the race for the five points for defeating your teammate, as Kevin Magnussen fires off 20th.",

So excited to see what the movie does.\u201d\n\nEsteban Ocon, Alpine A523, Carlos Sainz, Ferrari SF-23, Charles Leclerc, Ferrari SF-23, George Russell, Mercedes F1 W14, others queue to leave the pits Photo by: Glenn Dunbar / Motorsport Images\n\nFerrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc expressed his support for the filming.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun, it\u2019s a new face and definitely quite unexpected to see Brad in the drivers\u2019 briefing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey did a bit of a brief of what to expect for the movie and it just is very exciting. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing it. Nice guy.\u201d\n\nPierre Gasly, who posted a selfie of himself with Pitt, Hamilton and Leclerc, admitted that he hadn\u2019t registered any impact from the filming thus far.\n\n\u201cI must say it's not every day you get the chance to see Brad Pitt,\u201d said the Alpine driver. \u201cWe got the chance to meet him and they introduced themselves and the movie. It was definitely a special moment.\n\n\u201cApart from the driver's briefing and sitting right in front of Brad Pitt, everything kind of felt normal.\n\n\u201cSo on my side, I will say it has changed nothing. But I think on Sunday, the grid might look slightly different than usual. We'll see what happens.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile world champion Max Verstappen showed less enthusiasm for the project than most of his colleagues.\n\n\u201cI think they're going to use some shots of everybody, in terms of onboard cameras and stuff,\" said the Dutchman. \u201cI completely can\u2019t be bothered with this!\n\n\u201cIn the end, a film is always made to create a little bit of a show in it. Because yes, of course, it won't all be real. But I think it's all fine. I'm actually not that much into it.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Matt Kew and Erwin Jaeggi",

            "article_html": "<div><p class=\"article__paragraph article__paragraph--left\" id=\"KDHPLOLNEBAD5KHAHHN4CHNFY4\">SILVERSTONE, U.K. - One of the biggest races in the Formula 1 season is set for Sunday in England, as Max Verstappen&#8217;s path to another world championship goes through Silverstone and the British Grand Prix.</p><p id=\"inarticle-1\"></p><p id=\"inarticle-2\"></p><p class=\"article__paragraph article__paragraph--left\" id=\"EFZRQMJ2UVAYTHLAIDTJAVSNVA\">The gap between Max Verstappen and the rest of the grid is starting to become laughable, similar to what Sebastian Vettel was doing in the Red Bull car a decade ago. The Dutchman won his fifth consecutive race last Sunday in Austria, beating the runner-up, Charles Leclerc, by over five seconds, and that is only because Verstappen pitted before the final lap to get soft tires to set the fastest lap in the race. </p><p id=\"InContent_Center_EFZRQMJ2UVAYTHLAIDTJAVSNVA\" class=\"ad-observer\"></p><p id=\"inarticle-3\"></p><p class=\"article__paragraph article__paragraph--left\" id=\"N6RS3AZ7ANFYBNGHEEFJVEGGTM\">The two-time defending series champion has an 81-point lead over Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez. Checo had a much-needed podium at the Red Bull Ring last week, finishing third after struggling to even get into the top five for close to a month. While the constructor&#8217;s championship is all but decided, confidence is needed for Perez in order to keep his seat with the dominant team.</p><p id=\"InContent_Center_N6RS3AZ7ANFYBNGHEEFJVEGGTM\" class=\"ad-observer\"></p><p id=\"inarticle-4\"></p><p class=\"article__paragraph article__paragraph--left\" id=\"QTQ4MO7GAZATXHW6BOE6HEAMZM\">Heading into the big event in England, it is going to be interesting to see what other teams step up. While Leclerc ran well, and Ferrari teammate Carlos Sainz finished sixth, McLaren and Mercedes hope to challenge for podium pots against Fernando Alonso and Aston Martin.

            "text": "SILVERSTONE, U.K. - One of the biggest races in the Formula 1 season is set for Sunday in England, as Max Verstappen\u2019s path to another world championship goes through Silverstone and the British Grand Prix.\n\nThe gap between Max Verstappen and the rest of the grid is starting to become laughable, similar to what Sebastian Vettel was doing in the Red Bull car a decade ago. The Dutchman won his fifth consecutive race last Sunday in Austria, beating the runner-up, Charles Leclerc, by over five seconds, and that is only because Verstappen pitted before the final lap to get soft tires to set the fastest lap in the race.\n\nThe two-time defending series champion has an 81-point lead over Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez. Checo had a much-needed podium at the Red Bull Ring last week, finishing third after struggling to even get into the top five for close to a month. While the constructor\u2019s championship is all but decided, confidence is needed for Perez in order to keep his seat with the dominant team.\n\nHeading into the big event in England, it is going to be interesting to see what other teams step up. While Leclerc ran well, and Ferrari teammate Carlos Sainz finished sixth, McLaren and Mercedes hope to challenge for podium pots against Fernando Alonso and Aston Martin. It is the home race for McLaren and their top driver Lando Norris, who scored a P4 finish in Austria, his best run of the season. For Mercedes, both Lewis Hamilton and George Russell look to have better outcomes in their home country.\n\nWhat might be worth noting heading into Silverstone is that Red Bull has not won there since Mark Webber scored a victory in the 2012 edition of the event. Since then, Hamilton has won seven times, with only Mercedes and Ferrari winning at the famed circuit.\n\nFormula 1\n\nAramco British Grand Prix\n\nWhen: Sunday, July 9\n\nTime: 10 a.m. ET\n\nWhere: Silverstone Circuit (Silverstone, U.K.)\n\nChannel: ESPN2, ESPN Deportes\n\nStream: FuboTV (Free Trial), Sling, DirecTV Stream, ESPN+\n\nCheck out the Formula 1 results and standings here",

So now we still need to wait till tomorrow that we see how is the pace.\"\n\nBottas said the latest upgrade package has improved the car: \"It's a step. I definitely feel the step and I think today we managed to extract a bit more with a setup. It seems like it needed a different set-up in terms of ride height and everything.\n\n\u201cSo now it actually felt a step, more high-speed load basically, without affecting the low-speed performance.\u201d",

            "text": "Lewis Hamilton serves as executive producer for the as-yet-unnamed film, and the former world champion has played a big part in helping it come together and ensuring a level of authenticity in the script.\n\nA fictional 11th team called Apex has a strong presence in the paddock and has taken over a pit garage, complete with a \u201cprat perch\u201d on the pit wall opposite.\n\nWith the F1 organisation\u2019s support, the film crew has installed its own cameras of some of the cars in order to capture on-track action.\n\nThe production\u2019s own F2 cars, which carry AMG logos and have been modified with the help of Mercedes to look like current F1 machines, will be present at the back of the grid before Sunday\u2019s British GP. They will also complete part of the formation lap before peeling off.\n\nAlthough their names haven\u2019t been confirmed it\u2019s understood that the cars will be driven by former Superleague Formula driver Craig Dolby and 2012 F2 champion Luciano Bacheta, both of whom have worked extensively in films since their racing careers fizzled out.\n\nPitt and co-star Damson Idris will also drive the cars for some sequences in the coming months and have been undertaking tuition at Silverstone and Paul Ricard.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been involved pretty early and I think when we had the first discussions, we sent Brad to a driving school in France, going through the formula cars from F4 all the way up,\u201d said Wolff.\n\nThe nose cone of Brad Pitt's fictional Apple Orginals Formula 1 team in the pit lane Photo by: Mark Sutton / Motorsport Images\n\n\u201cAnd we tried to be helpful with the narrative. Lewis is an executive producer, so he wanted to make sure when the movie comes out, it\u2019s as realistic as possible.\n\n\u201cAnd we had a few laughs \u2013 but I think it\u2019s a very good narrative, and the effort they\u2019ve put in, we helped them \u2013 it was Fred [Vasseur\u2019s] idea, I think \u2013 to use an F2 car and build the bodywork around it that looks like an F1 car.\n\n\u201cAnd then the garages and the pit wall, all of it, we tried to be helpful and give them the designs so they could be as realistic as possible. And then you see now, that is such an effort.\n\n\u201cI spoke to the director a few weeks ago and said, \u2018Where are you?\u2019, expecting him to tell me he\u2019s in Hollywood \u2013 but he said \u2018I\u2019m in my apartment in Brackley,\u2019 so it\u2019s not all great with being a movie director!\n\n\"When you go in the garage and the whole set-up they have behind it, really unbelievable.\u201d\n\nOffering his thoughts on the project, Ferrari team principal Vasseur added: \"I think the job done on the car is amazing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an expert of all these things, but when you go into the garage, you have the feeling that it\u2019s a proper F1 team, and [it's] even better than some teams.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing what they did, and I hope that it will be at the level expected because it would be a huge push for the F1.\u201d\n\nLewis Hamilton, Mercedes W14 Photo by: Erik Junius\n\nHamilton \"nerves\" as filming begins\n\nHamilton has been heavily involved in the development of the F1-based film and, despite the highs of his record-breaking career, conceded to feeling 'nervous' as filming began.\n\n\u201cI was here a week or two before Austria, watching Brad practice,\u201d he said when asked by Autosport about the start of shooting.\n\n\u201cAnd it's massively exciting to see it all coming together. And to know that we're finally starting to film this weekend, it's like there's nerves naturally because it's something we've been working on for so long.\n\n\u201cAnd we want everyone to love it and to really feel that we encapsulate what the essence of this sport is all about. So that's our goal. I hope we can do you proud.\u201d\n\nAsked about the support the film is receiving from the F1 organisation he said: \u201cI've been really incredibly grateful to them. I don't know if this would have been possible 10-plus years ago, when the old management was in place.\n\n\"They wouldn't have perhaps seen this as an important step in terms of the sport\u2019s growth.\n\n\u201cBut we've already seen the great work and impact of the Netflix show and I think this will take it to new heights beyond that.\n\nBrad Pitt garage for the filming the weekend Photo by: Steven Tee / Motorsport Images\n\n\u201cSo yeah, I think there's so many people around the world, as you've seen already, that are so excited about this sport, wanting to learn more.\n\n\"And the fact that we will have all the original characters that are actually on the grid, and then Brad, is pretty cool.\u201d\n\nHamilton downplayed any issue with the age of Pitt\u2019s character within the story, despite the actor turning 60 in December.\n\n\u201cWell, firstly, Brad looks like he\u2019s ageing backwards,\" said Hamilton. \"He looks great for his age, and of course, that was a big topic at the beginning when we were discussing the first story.\n\n\"He\u2019s super-fit, he\u2019s been training.

He finished 20th and seventh in his last two British Grand Prix events, so there may be an opportunity for a new winner for the first time since April on Sunday.</p><p>Verstappen is the -450 favorite (risk $450 to win $100) in the 2023 British Grand Prix odds on Caesars Sportsbook. Englishman Lando Norris, who is sure to be a local favorite, follows Verstappen at +1000, with Charles Leclerq at +1600.

It's had a strong history of success in motorsports, correctly predicting nine NASCAR winners since the 2021 season and its projected leaderboards have forecasted winners across multiple racing formats.</p><p>The model has been scorching hot when it comes to picking Formula 1 race events dating back to 2021. It nailed both of Charles Leclerc's wins in 2022, and at the 2021 Mexican Grand Prix, the model was strongly backing Verstappen as its top pick. The result: Verstappen dominated the field and ran away with a surprise victory.&#160;</p>\n        <p id=\"native_story_flex_top\" class=\"ad-native-story-flex-top \">\n    </p>\n\n    <p>The model followed that up by calling Verstappen's win at the Rolex Emilia Romagna GP in April and then nailed his wins again in Belgium, the Netherlands, Japan, the United States, Mexico and Abu Dhabi. It's also nailed Verstappen's wins in Bahrain, Australia, Miami, Monaco, Spain, Canada and Austria this season. Anyone who followed the model's lead on those plays has seen huge returns</p><p>Now, the model has dialed in on the 2023 Formula 1 British Grand Prix and just released its coveted picks and leaderboard projections. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2023-formula-1-schedule-f1-picks-odds-british-grand-prix-projected-leaderboard-start-time-race-prediction-from-top-model/#ttag=07062023_agg_cbssports_picks_autoracing_formula1_model_britishgrandprix\" target=\"_blank\">You can head to SportsLine now to see the complete 2023 British Grand Prix leaderboard projection.</a></p><h2>Top 2023 Formula 1 British GP predictions</h2><p>One massive shocker: The model is fading Leclerc even though he's coming off a season-best second-place finish in Austria and is listed as the third favorite. He has +1600 odds but is sixth in the 2023 Formula 1 standings, largely because of his inconsistent racing this season.</p>\n        <p id=\"gambling_partner\" class=\"ad-gambling-partner GamblingPartnerAd lazyload lazypreload\">\n    </p>\n\n    <p>Last weekend was his first runner-up in nine races this season, and he's winless in his last 20 races. Although he finished second in the Formula 1 standings last year, the 25-year-old hasn't built on that success at all.

            "text": "Max Verstappen has been absolutely dominant in the 2023 Formula 1 season and is coming off his fifth straight victory last week. Will he continue that complete control over the rest of the Formula 1 field at the 2023 British Grand Prix at the Silverstone Circuit on Sunday at 10 a.m. ET? He finished 20th and seventh in his last two British Grand Prix events, so there may be an opportunity for a new winner for the first time since April on Sunday.\n\nVerstappen is the -450 favorite (risk $450 to win $100) in the 2023 British Grand Prix odds on Caesars Sportsbook. Englishman Lando Norris, who is sure to be a local favorite, follows Verstappen at +1000, with Charles Leclerq at +1600. Lewis Hamilton has +2000 odds to win his ninth British Grand Prix, while Sergio Perez is at +5000 after struggling in qualifying. Before analyzing the 2023 British Grand Prix starting grid and making any Formula 1 picks, be sure to check out the latest 2023 British GP predictions and betting advice from SportsLine's proven projection model.\n\nDeveloped by daily Fantasy pro and SportsLine predictive data engineer Mike McClure, this proprietary Formula 1 prediction model simulates every race 10,000 times, taking into account factors such as track history and recent results. It's had a strong history of success in motorsports, correctly predicting nine NASCAR winners since the 2021 season and its projected leaderboards have forecasted winners across multiple racing formats.\n\nThe model has been scorching hot when it comes to picking Formula 1 race events dating back to 2021. It nailed both of Charles Leclerc's wins in 2022, and at the 2021 Mexican Grand Prix, the model was strongly backing Verstappen as its top pick. The result: Verstappen dominated the field and ran away with a surprise victory.\n\nThe model followed that up by calling Verstappen's win at the Rolex Emilia Romagna GP in April and then nailed his wins again in Belgium, the Netherlands, Japan, the United States, Mexico and Abu Dhabi. It's also nailed Verstappen's wins in Bahrain, Australia, Miami, Monaco, Spain, Canada and Austria this season. Anyone who followed the model's lead on those plays has seen huge returns\n\nNow, the model has dialed in on the 2023 Formula 1 British Grand Prix and just released its coveted picks and leaderboard projections. You can head to SportsLine now to see the complete 2023 British Grand Prix leaderboard projection.\n\nTop 2023 Formula 1 British GP predictions\n\nOne massive shocker: The model is fading Leclerc even though he's coming off a season-best second-place finish in Austria and is listed as the third favorite. He has +1600 odds but is sixth in the 2023 Formula 1 standings, largely because of his inconsistent racing this season.\n\nLast weekend was his first runner-up in nine races this season, and he's winless in his last 20 races. Although he finished second in the Formula 1 standings last year, the 25-year-old hasn't built on that success at all. In fact, he's regressed with two finishes 19th or worse this season over just nine races after finishing 19th or worse three times last year in 22 races. The model doesn't see value in his 16-1 odds, picking him to finish outside the top five on Sunday. See who else the model is backing and who it is fading right here.\n\nHow to make 2023 British Grand Prix picks\n\nThe model is also targeting one longshot getting triple-digit British GP odds to make a surprising surge up the leaderboard. Anyone who backs him could hit it big. You can find out who he is, and see all of the model's F1 picks and predictions at SportsLine.\n\nSo who wins the British Grand Prix 2023, and which under-the-radar drivers make a stunning charge toward the front?

Thankfully for the bumper crowd at Silverstone, <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/team/williams/36474/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Williams</a> had a surprisingly strong showing in both FP1 and FP2.&#160;</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s everything we learned on Friday at the 2023 British GP.&#160;</p>\n<h2>The story of the day&#160;</h2>\n<p>FP1 got underway at 1230 local time &#8211; with a different feel compared to normal. &#160;</p>\n<p>One race on from the Austrian sprint event and with the development race hotting up behind Red Bull, many teams were trying test items in the opening session around the usual aim of finding the baseline set-up choices. There was flow viz and aerodynamic rakes aplenty. &#160;</p>\n<p>In a really not shocking twist, Red Bull led the way here &#8211; Verstappen setting the pace on a 1m28.600s, with his team-mate <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/driver/sergio-perez/829668/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sergio Perez</a> slotting in 0.448s behind. <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/driver/fernando-alonso/829156/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fernando Alonso</a> and Charles Leclerc took fourth and fifth (0.668s and 0.680s behind respectively), but <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/driver/alex-albon/840486/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alex Albon</a> caused a stir putting his Williams a popular home third &#8211; 0.489s off the pace.&#160;</p>\n<p>In the second session starting just after 1600, it was much more business as usual in terms of how the teams went about applying themselves &#8211; no more testing, just solidly understanding the new beefier construction of Pirelli tyres now in play. &#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p>   <img src=\"//cdn-5.motorsport.com/images/mgl/YXRkLl50/s1000/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing-1.jpg\" alt=\"Verstappen was unstoppable on Friday at Silverstone\"> \n<p class=\"title\">Verstappen was unstoppable on Friday at Silverstone</p>\n<p class=\"photographer\">Photo by: Jake Grant / <a href=\"https://www.motorsportimages.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Motorsport Images</a></p>\n<p>Again, as can be seen in the times below, Verstappen led the way, but this time Sainz was right on the Dutchman&#8217;s pace, coming in 0.022s adrift.&#160;</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t a happy FP2 on the other side of the Ferrari garage, as a short circuit forced Leclerc to miss the entire second one-hour session, which was delayed five minutes due to the track needing a thorough sweeping after several offs and crashes in the previously run Formula 2 qualifying session.&#160;</p>\n<h2>FP2 overall order</h2>\n\n\n\n<strong>Pos</strong>\n<strong>Driver</strong>\n<strong>Team</strong>\n<strong>Time</strong>\n<strong>Gap</strong>\n\n\n1\nVerstappen\nRed Bull\n1m28.078s\n&#160;\n\n\n2\nSainz\nFerrari\n1m28.100s\n+0.022s\n\n\n3\nAlbon\nWilliams\n1m28.296s\n+0.218s\n\n\n4\nStroll\nAston Martin\n1m28.866s\n+0.788s\n\n\n5\nHulkenberg\nHaas\n1m28.880s\n+0.802s\n\n\n6\nGasly&#160;\n<a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/team/alpine/39174/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alpine</a>\n1m28.889s\n+0.811s\n\n\n7\nPiastri\n<a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/team/mclaren/36473/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McLaren</a>\n1m28.926s\n+0.848s\n\n\n8\nZhou\n<a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/team/alfa-romeo/39119/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alfa Romeo</a>\n1m29.225s\n+1.147s\n\n\n9\nRussell\nMercedes\n1m29.238s\n+1.160s\n\n\n10\nTsunoda\n<a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/team/alphatauri-36471/36471/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AlphaTauri</a>\n1m29.483s\n+1.405s\n\n\n\n<p>Williams did end the day with joy spread across its pitbox, as, after Albon had backed up his FP1 result with another third in FP2, <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/driver/logan-sargeant/863323/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Logan Sargeant</a> put the second specially liveried FW45 into fifth behind Perez.

As was the other Brit, <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/driver/lando-norris/840487/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lando Norris</a> in 14th &#8211; although at least London-born Albon had restored something for the home crowd in his Grove-built Williams.&#160;</p>\n   <img src=\"//cdn-7.motorsport.com/images/mgl/0k7R8vK0/s1000/alex-albon-williams-fw45-oscar-1.jpg\" alt=\"Albon showed well in both Friday sessions, ending the day in P3 with team-mate Logan Sargeant P5\"> \n<p class=\"title\">Albon showed well in both Friday sessions, ending the day in P3 with team-mate Logan Sargeant P5</p>\n<p class=\"photographer\">Photo by: Simon Galloway / <a href=\"https://www.motorsportimages.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Motorsport Images</a></p>\n<p>The Black Arrows drivers were left lamenting the hot 30&#176;C air temperature in FP2, which continued their trend of struggling in such conditions. Hamilton also had to abandon his first lap on his qualifying simulation effort after struggling to get his car to hit apexes in the first sector.&#160;</p>\n<h2>New tyres present a new challenge, but Red Bull looks strong no matter what on race pace&#160;</h2>\n<p>Given the teams were trialling the new tyres, there was a lot more running than usual in the late-FP2 long-run data-gathering exercises. Haas even completed nearly half a GP distance, with <a href=\"https://www.autosport.com/driver/nico-hulkenberg/829440/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nico Hulkenberg</a> pounding around on the hards.&#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>With all the usual caveats about fuel load and engine modes applying, we can see the start of the Silverstone weekend picture, which looks very good for Red Bull, less so for Ferrari despite its one-lap pace, and Mercedes feeling it has a car that can fight for a podium but would right now struggle to qualify in the top 10.</p>\n<h2>Soft tyre averages</h2>\n\n\n\n<strong>Pos</strong>\n<strong>Team</strong>\n<strong>Lap</strong>\n<strong>Average</strong>\n\n\n1\nRed Bull\n1m33.603s\n9 laps\n\n\n2\nAston Martin\n1m33.982s\n10 laps\n\n\n3\nMercedes\n1m34.441s\n13 laps\n\n\n4\nFerrari\n1m34.506s\n11 laps\n\n\n5\nAlphaTauri\n1m34.541s\n9 laps\n\n\n6\nAlfa Romeo&#160;\n1m34.840s\n9 laps\n\n\n7\nMcLaren\n1m34.695s\n12 laps\n\n\n\n<p>n/a - Williams, Haas and Alpine</p>\n<p>Pirelli reckons there is a chance all three compounds this weekend could be viable race options, with plenty of teams deciding to spend a long time evaluating the softs in FP2. &#160;</p>\n<p>As can be seen above, Red Bull led the way by a considerable margin on this tyre compared to its usual closest chasers. This suggests it was operating to a standardised fuel load and getting its drivers to manage their pace in line with how they know the tyres will hold up at other tracks, rather than filling up their tanks more as may have been the case for other teams.&#160;</p>\n<p>Aston will be very encouraged by its performance on the softs. So too will Mercedes &#8211; even if its margin to Red Bull is a hefty 0.838s on average. This is because Hamilton&#8217;s times in that run were very consistent and actually improved on his final tours, with the seven-time world champion feeling his balance improved as the tyres wore. &#160;</p><p class=\"ms-ap\"></p><p>Mercedes also feels its front wing update brought to this race is an improvement, but the wind and tyre factors at play today were covering things up a touch.&#160;</p>\n   <img src=\"//cdn-6.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6l9jBwk0/s1000/lewis-hamilton-mercedes-f1-w14-1.jpg\" alt=\"Mercedes ran a new front wing but both Hamilton and Russell struggled on Friday, with neither featuring in the top 10\"> \n<p class=\"title\">Mercedes ran a new front wing but both Hamilton and Russell struggled on Friday, with neither featuring in the top 10</p>\n<p class=\"photographer\">Photo by: Simon Galloway / <a href=\"https://www.motorsportimages.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Motorsport Images</a></p>\n<p>On the former, there was a healthy crosswind shooting across the cars as they traversed the Loop, Luffield, Stowe and Club turns. This made for a considerable challenge at all but Stowe, which has its own downforce-demanding requirements, as the lower-speed corners are not territory where ground-effect cars perform well. &#160;</p>\n<p>This meant all the drivers were struggling with extra rear sliding, which had a knock-on impact on tyre preservation. Plus, there was the high track temperatures to cope with in FP2.

It might have been wind, it might have been balance, or me getting used to balance. This track is really about trying to weigh the scales the whole way around and making compromises here and there. There&#8217;s such a fine edge on the balance and such a big balance window. It&#8217;s back and forth, it&#8217;s never just here and you can just drive it. It&#8217;s like one end to the other end of the spectrum, from braking to turn in, to mid, to the exit of every corner.

            "text": "Ferrari\u2019s Carlos Sainz pushed Max Verstappen close on pure pace at the end of the opening practice sessions for Formula 1\u2019s 2023 British Grand Prix, but a close look at the data shows the Red Bull driver was under little pressure when it comes to race speed.\n\nIn the other Ferrari, an electric problem meant Charles Leclerc missed all of FP2, while the Aston Martin drivers had little things break on their machines that caused interruptions in the afternoon session. At Mercedes, things were more of a struggle overall, which contributed to the home crowd having less reason than usual to cheer for Lewis Hamilton and George Russell. Thankfully for the bumper crowd at Silverstone, Williams had a surprisingly strong showing in both FP1 and FP2.\n\nHere\u2019s everything we learned on Friday at the 2023 British GP.\n\nThe story of the day\n\nFP1 got underway at 1230 local time \u2013 with a different feel compared to normal.\n\nOne race on from the Austrian sprint event and with the development race hotting up behind Red Bull, many teams were trying test items in the opening session around the usual aim of finding the baseline set-up choices. There was flow viz and aerodynamic rakes aplenty.\n\nIn a really not shocking twist, Red Bull led the way here \u2013 Verstappen setting the pace on a 1m28.600s, with his team-mate Sergio Perez slotting in 0.448s behind. Fernando Alonso and Charles Leclerc took fourth and fifth (0.668s and 0.680s behind respectively), but Alex Albon caused a stir putting his Williams a popular home third \u2013 0.489s off the pace.\n\nIn the second session starting just after 1600, it was much more business as usual in terms of how the teams went about applying themselves \u2013 no more testing, just solidly understanding the new beefier construction of Pirelli tyres now in play.\n\nVerstappen was unstoppable on Friday at Silverstone Photo by: Jake Grant / Motorsport Images\n\nAgain, as can be seen in the times below, Verstappen led the way, but this time Sainz was right on the Dutchman\u2019s pace, coming in 0.022s adrift.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a happy FP2 on the other side of the Ferrari garage, as a short circuit forced Leclerc to miss the entire second one-hour session, which was delayed five minutes due to the track needing a thorough sweeping after several offs and crashes in the previously run Formula 2 qualifying session.\n\nFP2 overall order\n\nPos Driver Team Time Gap 1 Verstappen Red Bull 1m28.078s 2 Sainz Ferrari 1m28.100s +0.022s 3 Albon Williams 1m28.296s +0.218s 4 Stroll Aston Martin 1m28.866s +0.788s 5 Hulkenberg Haas 1m28.880s +0.802s 6 Gasly Alpine 1m28.889s +0.811s 7 Piastri McLaren 1m28.926s +0.848s 8 Zhou Alfa Romeo 1m29.225s +1.147s 9 Russell Mercedes 1m29.238s +1.160s 10 Tsunoda AlphaTauri 1m29.483s +1.405s\n\nWilliams did end the day with joy spread across its pitbox, as, after Albon had backed up his FP1 result with another third in FP2, Logan Sargeant put the second specially liveried FW45 into fifth behind Perez. The team feels it has returned to the high-speed prowess it showed in Canada, but nevertheless, its high placing has surprised even those in blue.\n\nWith all the usual caveats about fuel load and engine modes applying, we can see the start of the Silverstone weekend picture, which looks very good for Red Bull, less so for Ferrari despite its one-lap pace\n\nThe other usual 2023 frontrunners found themselves in considerable strife in FP2.\n\nAston Martin\u2019s two drivers had their soft tyre qualifying simulation runs interrupted by car problems \u2013 Fernando Alonso was ordered to pit as a wheel rim issue developed on his AMR22, while Lance Stroll needed his left-side wing mirror fixed as its mounting came loose.\n\nStroll ended up as Aston\u2019s top driver in sixth, but his late-FP2 long-running session was, however, complicated by a stone kicked up by another car striking one of his fingers and causing him considerable pain.\n\nMercedes ended FP2 with their two British drivers out of the top 10. As was the other Brit, Lando Norris in 14th \u2013 although at least London-born Albon had restored something for the home crowd in his Grove-built Williams.\n\nAlbon showed well in both Friday sessions, ending the day in P3 with team-mate Logan Sargeant P5 Photo by: Simon Galloway / Motorsport Images\n\nThe Black Arrows drivers were left lamenting the hot 30\u00b0C air temperature in FP2, which continued their trend of struggling in such conditions. Hamilton also had to abandon his first lap on his qualifying simulation effort after struggling to get his car to hit apexes in the first sector.\n\nNew tyres present a new challenge, but Red Bull looks strong no matter what on race pace\n\nGiven the teams were trialling the new tyres, there was a lot more running than usual in the late-FP2 long-run data-gathering exercises. Haas even completed nearly half a GP distance, with Nico Hulkenberg pounding around on the hards.\n\nWith all the usual caveats about fuel load and engine modes applying, we can see the start of the Silverstone weekend picture, which looks very good for Red Bull, less so for Ferrari despite its one-lap pace, and Mercedes feeling it has a car that can fight for a podium but would right now struggle to qualify in the top 10.\n\nSoft tyre averages\n\nPos Team Lap Average 1 Red Bull 1m33.603s 9 laps 2 Aston Martin 1m33.982s 10 laps 3 Mercedes 1m34.441s 13 laps 4 Ferrari 1m34.506s 11 laps 5 AlphaTauri 1m34.541s 9 laps 6 Alfa Romeo 1m34.840s 9 laps 7 McLaren 1m34.695s 12 laps n/a - Williams, Haas and Alpine\n\nPirelli reckons there is a chance all three compounds this weekend could be viable race options, with plenty of teams deciding to spend a long time evaluating the softs in FP2.\n\nAs can be seen above, Red Bull led the way by a considerable margin on this tyre compared to its usual closest chasers. This suggests it was operating to a standardised fuel load and getting its drivers to manage their pace in line with how they know the tyres will hold up at other tracks, rather than filling up their tanks more as may have been the case for other teams.\n\nAston will be very encouraged by its performance on the softs. So too will Mercedes \u2013 even if its margin to Red Bull is a hefty 0.838s on average. This is because Hamilton\u2019s times in that run were very consistent and actually improved on his final tours, with the seven-time world champion feeling his balance improved as the tyres wore.\n\nMercedes also feels its front wing update brought to this race is an improvement, but the wind and tyre factors at play today were covering things up a touch.\n\nMercedes ran a new front wing but both Hamilton and Russell struggled on Friday, with neither featuring in the top 10 Photo by: Simon Galloway / Motorsport Images\n\nOn the former, there was a healthy crosswind shooting across the cars as they traversed the Loop, Luffield, Stowe and Club turns. This made for a considerable challenge at all but Stowe, which has its own downforce-demanding requirements, as the lower-speed corners are not territory where ground-effect cars perform well.\n\nThis meant all the drivers were struggling with extra rear sliding, which had a knock-on impact on tyre preservation. Plus, there was the high track temperatures to cope with in FP2. These meant struggles to keep front tyres in perfect temperature balance and if this went awry, the drivers would lose front axle grip too.\n\nFerrari\u2019s soft-tyre long run comes in adrift of its typical rivals, but it was back to being Red Bull\u2019s closest challenger on the mediums \u2013 albeit by such a hefty margin to suspect a major fuel load difference might be at play.\n\nMedium tyre averages\n\nPos Team Lap Average 1 Red Bull 1m33.016s 7 laps 2 Ferrari 1m33.976s 6 laps 3 Aston Martin 1m34.416s 13 laps 4 Alpine 1m34.556s 11 laps 5 Mercedes 1m34.619s 6 laps 6 Williams 1m34.666s 15 laps 7 Haas 1m35.049s 8 laps 8 Alfa Romeo 1m35.167s 10 laps n/a - McLaren and AlphaTauri Ferrari\u2019s performance on the mediums will be important to remember for the rest of the weekend if the softs do not end up as part of the race strategy. On this, a two-stop race should be expected and it appears here the Scuderia may already be looking to split its tactics across its cars \u2013 provided Leclerc\u2019s electronics issue is addressed over the rest of the weekend. Sainz has an extra set of new hard tyres available compared to the one set for both Red Bulls and Leclerc, while it\u2019s the reverse on new mediums for those four drivers. Ferrari has had strong race strategy of late, but its qualifying calls that have made the news for the Scuderia \u2013 because they have been poor. This has coincided with changes to lower temperature or rain (think Spain and Canada more than Austria), which is what is forecast for FP3 and potentially qualifying as well at Silverstone tomorrow.

            "title": "F1 track limits, explained",
            "article_html": "<div><p id=\"nl0h5u\">Limits being exceeded was something of a theme this past weekend.</p>\n<p id=\"OYefNq\">Certainly you have the ongoing transition at Twitter. Elon Musk outlined some changes to the social media website on Saturday, aimed at combating bots on Twitter. As a result users, including those subscribed to Twitter Blue, kept encountering &#8220;rate limit exceeded&#8221; errors, rending the website almost unusable for extended periods of time.</p>\n<p id=\"8McE7z\">However, here we are focused on the Austrian Grand Prix. If you watched any of the Formula 1 action &#8212; whether qualifying on Friday, the F1 Sprint Saturday, the Grand Prix itself, or all of the above &#8212; you likely heard the phrase &#8220;track limits exceeded.&#8221;</p>\n<p id=\"cjlaep\">During qualifying alone, 47 laps were deleted due to &#8220;exceeding track limits,&#8221; resulting in a shaken-up field and lots of angry drivers, teams, and fans. Then in the Grand Prix itself a number of drivers were hit with penalties for exceeding track limits, and it even led to a <a href=\"https://www.sbnation.com/formula-one/2023/7/2/23781889/aston-martin-f1-protest-austrian-grand-prix\">post-race protest from Aston Martin</a>, inquiring whether all the appropriate penalties were levied.</p>\n<p id=\"yh94ja\">That protest was upheld, and even more drivers were hit with penalties hours after the race concluded. An additional 12 penalties were handed out to 8 drivers, and race officials noted that they still were unable to review all <a href=\"https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/fia-unable-to-review-1200-potential-f1-track-limit-offences-in-austrian-gp/10490769/\">1,200 potential incidents</a> of exceeding track limits. </p>\n<p id=\"I45s0c\">So we thought it worth taking a moment to outline what that means, as well as the penalty process.</p>\n<p id=\"X8ynWL\">Simply put, &#8220;track limits&#8221; refers to the white lines along the edges of an F1 track. They define the edges of the circuit, acting as the boundaries for the &#8220;field of play,&#8221; as it were. They also play a key safety role, limiting how drivers can attack the circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"uIgYtl\">As long as drivers maintain contact with the white lines, even if slightly, they are in compliance. But if all four tyres cross the white lines to the outside, they are found to be in violation of Article 33.3 of the Sporting Regulations, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"1KpzI8\">Drivers must make every reasonable effort to use the track at all times and may not leave the track without a justifiable reason. </p>\n<p id=\"YpnDD6\">Drivers will be judged to have left the track if no part of the car remains in contact with it and, for the avoidance of doubt, any white lines defining the track edges are considered to be part of the track but the kerbs are not. </p>\n<p id=\"gZOjdM\">Should a car leave the track the driver may re-join, however, this may only be done when it is safe to do so and without gaining any lasting advantage. At the absolute discretion of the Race Director a driver may be given the opportunity to give back the whole of any advantage he gained by leaving the track.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"LNONck\">So that is the rule, now let&#8217;s talk about the penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"3f4kSQ\">Because here is where it gets even trickier.</p>\n<p id=\"x7xgRM\">During practices and qualifying, things are relatively straightforward. If a driver is found to have exceeded track limits, their time for that lap is deleted. In addition, if a driver is found to have exceeded track limits in the final corner of one lap, their time for the next lap may be deleted if race stewards determine that the driver gained an advantage for the subsequent lap.</p>\n<p id=\"Tdygv2\">That leads to results like Friday, where Sergio P&#233;rez had three lap times deleted during Q2 for exceeding track limits. P&#233;rez failed to post a lap time as a consequence, preventing him from advancing to Q3.</p>\n<p id=\"T6nCK2\">Drivers get a bit of reprieve during a race, but not much. While practices and qualifying see no warnings handed out to drivers, during a race receive two warnings for violations. The third such violation results in a black-and-white flag, which is the final warning. That tells the driver that any additional violation will result in a penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"HjfsVT\">As for what the penalties are, we saw them on Sunday. The first penalty is a five-second violation, which is served either at the driver&#8217;s next pit stop, or if no additional pit stops are made, gets added to the driver&#8217;s time in the race.</p>\n<p id=\"QzQGHZ\">Any subsequent penalty will see ten seconds handed down, as was the case with Yuki Tsunoda in the Austrian Grand Prix. </p>\n<p id=\"Nl8csV\">Now, why was this such an issue in the Austrian Grand Prix? It has to do with the configuration of the circuit. Red Bull Ring has a number of long straights followed by hard, angled turns, such as Turn 1 and Turn 3.</p>\n<p id=\"XSIDgq\">There is also the setup of Turn 10, which is a right-handed turn coming after a downhill, which puts additional gravity stress on the cars, and the drivers. During the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516590&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheathletic.com%2F4656435%2F2023%2F06%2F30%2Ff1-austrian-gp-track-limits-explained%2F&amp;referrer=sbnation.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sbnation.com%2Fformula-one%2F2023%2F7%2F3%2F23781874%2Ff1-track-limits-explained-austrian-grand-prix-aston-martin\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">47 violations</a> during Friday&#8217;s qualifying session, 33 of them came at Turn 10.</p>\n<p id=\"nCGNgr\">As you might expect, drivers were frustrated by these decisions throughout the weekend. Most notably was Lewis Hamilton, who was one of the drivers first hit with a penalty during the Grand Prix. During the rest of the race Hamilton acted as a steward out on the track, continually pointing out violations by other drivers to his team over the radio.</p>\n<p id=\"OodfBw\">But he was not alone, as drivers such as Lando Norris &#8212; who was drawing attention to Hamilton&#8217;s driving in the early stages of the Austrian Grand Prix &#8212; were doing the same. </p>\n<p id=\"9U0YQQ\">&#8220;Yeah, I mean, it is, I think one of the worst tracks for it, with the track limits. Also, especially towards the end, the tyres are getting really hot so they&#8217;re not as agile anymore as well compared to the beginning of the lap,&#8221; said Max Verstappen <a href=\"https://www.fia.com/news/f1-2023-austrian-grand-prix-post-qualifying-press-conference-transcript\">after qualifying on Friday</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"fSgBYp\">&#8220;But it&#8217;s super hard to judge around here. You have all the compressions as well, where if you hit it slightly wrong, the car immediately drops away from you or understeers and then it&#8217;s super easy to go over the white line. And I think today it looked very silly. It almost looked like we were amateurs out there, the amount of lap times that were getting deleted,&#8221; added Verstappen. &#8220;And also, some of them were so marginal, where even we spoke about it in the briefing before that, when it&#8217;s very marginal, it&#8217;s impossible to judge if it&#8217;s out or in, and they were still getting deleted. So I don&#8217;t think it was a good look today.&#8221;</p>\n<p id=\"xvc1jJ\">&#8220;This track is particularly tricky, especially Turn 10, because the nature of the corner is that the car is getting lighter in the middle of the corner because there&#8217;s this drop in the track and then however the car is positioned there it has a big influence on the exit and from where we are, so low in the car, we cannot see anything,&#8221; said Charles Leclerc <a href=\"https://www.fia.com/news/f1-2023-austrian-grand-prix-post-qualifying-press-conference-transcript\">after qualifying</a> on Friday. &#8220;I think the helmet cam is very representative of what we are seeing, and we are not seeing at all the white lines, so yeah, hopefully in the future in tracks like this we can have a bit more margin and that they understand that from the car it is just impossible to judge.&#8221;</p>\n<p id=\"J1Mv8g\">P&#233;rez, who finished third in the Grand Prix despite failing to advance to Q3 on Friday due to lap times being deleted for exceeding track limits, did his best to bit his tongue after the race.</p>\n<p id=\"SBY4De\">&#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s really nice to get back to the podium, especially at home, such a special weekend for the team and on our weekend that started overall really bad with&#8230; I don&#8217;t know how to say it, I don&#8217;t want to use a bad word&#8230; but for the track limits, I think everyone got hit by it at some point,&#8221; said the Red Bull <a href=\"https://www.fia.com/news/f1-2023-austrian-grand-prix-post-race-press-conference-transcript\">driver in the post-race press conferences</a>. &#8220;Hopefully next year when we come back, it&#8217;s something that it can be fixed.&#8221;</p>\n<p id=\"tkbhMm\">As for what could be done, it seems FIA is already making some requests of Red Bull Ring.</p>\n<p id=\"q6711F\">In an effort to give drivers more of a reason to stay within track limits, gravel could be added around certain areas of the track. That would force drivers to stay clear inside the lines, for fear of running into the gravel, and losing valuable time, or even worse, damaging the floors of their cars. </p>\n<p id=\"9fGzks\">In addition, a more obvious physical deterrent would even aid the drivers in identifying the limits of the track. As Leclerc noted on Friday, sometimes the drivers simply cannot see exactly where the limits are. </p>\n<p id=\"FVXu0u\">&#8220;The problem is it&#8217;s very difficult for the drivers because they can&#8217;t see the white line from the car so you&#8217;re just purely doing it on feel and the circuit invites you to go there,&#8221; said Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner, <a href=\"https://www.racefans.net/2023/07/02/put-the-gravel-back-fia-tells-red-bull-ring-after-20-track-limits-penalties-in-race/\">speaking before the post-race penalties</a> were announced. &#8220;So I think that it&#8217;s something that needs to be looked at for next year to perhaps add more of a deterrent for the drivers to be drawn onto that part of the circuit.&#8221;</p>\n<p id=\"1V5EQG\">According to this report from RaceFans, the FIA has requested that Red Bull Ring install a gravel trap at Turn 10, a request the FIA has made before. &#8220;In order to address the issue for future events we will renew our recommendation to the circuit to add a gravel trap at the exit of turns nine and 10,&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.racefans.net/2023/07/02/put-the-gravel-back-fia-tells-red-bull-ring-after-20-track-limits-penalties-in-race/\">said a spokesperson</a> from FIA to RaceFans. &#8220;We note that while this is not a straightforward solution in relation to other series that race here, it has proved to be very effective at other corners and circuits with similar issues.&#8221;</p>\n<p id=\"zP9uc5\">Until then, however, expect to hear &#8220;track limits exceeded&#8221; a few more times. </p>\n  \n</div>",

The Chinese Grand Prix will return for the first time since 2019, while Japan moves from its long-held fall date slot to the early part of the season. At the start of the season, both Bahrain and Saudi Arabia will be Saturday races. Later this year, F1 will announce which weekends will feature Sprint races.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">24 races in 2024 with big steps forward in regionalisation &#127759;</p>\n<p>Introducing next year&#8217;s Formula 1 calendar &#128467;&#65039;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/F1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#F1</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/JTSWJL29yH\">pic.twitter.com/JTSWJL29yH</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Formula 1 (@F1) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/F1/status/1676584214559444993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 5, 2023</a></p></blockquote><p></p><p>At a record 24 races, the 2024 calendar will be the toughest yet for F1. Efforts have been made to regionalize the schedule better &#8212; bunching together races in the same parts of the world &#8212; aiding logistics and the toll it places on the thousands of people traveling from event to event. But a number of big pressures make the &#8216;perfect calendar&#8217; hard to achieve.</p><p>This is how F1 ended up with its longest, most intricate calendar to date.</p><h2><b>Ramadan forces Saturday races</b></h2><p>A big scheduling headache for F1 going into 2024 was the timing of Ramadan. Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have opened the season since 2022, taking place before the start of the holy month. But as this begins on March 10 next year, squeezing both races in before that date looked like a challenge. By the end of Ramadan on April 9, conditions in the region would be too hot.</p><p>At one point, it looked like Saudi Arabia would open the season and that Bahrain would shift to later in the year. But F1 found a way to squeeze both in before the start of Ramadan by shifting them to Saturday races &#8212; that puts the Saudi GP on March 9. There is still the usual gap to travel between the two races. As pre-season testing is also poised to be held in Bahrain again, from February 21-23, it will create a three-week run in the Middle East for the paddock to start the year.</p><p class=\"ad-slug\">Advertisement</p><p id=\"mid2\" class=\"ad place-ad\"></p><p>This year&#8217;s Las Vegas Grand Prix will take place on a Saturday night, in a bid to capture the late-night audience, and will be the first Saturday race since the 1985 South African Grand Prix. But the Saturday shift for Bahrain and Saudi Arabia is solely down to Ramadan, and not a long-term consideration for the future.</p><h2><b>China returns, Japan moves</b></h2><p>While China was listed on the provisional calendar for 2023, its return was never likely until the country changed its Covid-19 restrictions. Now that it has abandoned its zero-Covid policy and is welcoming major international sporting events again, such as the ATP tennis tour, the grand prix will return for the first time since 2019.</p><p>It will give China&#8217;s first F1 driver, <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/4413099/2023/04/16/zhou-guanyu-formula-1/\">Zhou Guanyu, a long-awaited chance</a> to race in front of his home fans. But question marks remain over the long-term future of the race future beyond the end of its existing contract, which expires in 2025, given interest from new markets in Asia such as South Korea.</p><p>Japan&#8217;s move is also notable. The race had previously been staunch about wanting a fall date, but this also coincided with periods of bad weather. In 2019, Saturday&#8217;s events had to be called off due to the threat of a typhoon, while torrential rain meant only 28 laps of the grand prix could be completed. Moving to April should bring better weather, and also gives a chance of coinciding with Japan&#8217;s cherry blossom season.</p><p>Although Japan fits better geographically with Australia and China from a logistics point of view, making all three races standalone events will add to the air miles clocked up by paddock personnel should they opt to return home between each race. The alternative is more time away from home, which is not always viable or in the best interest of the team.</p><h2><b>Where the American races fit in</b></h2><p>Miami, Austin and Las Vegas are three of F1&#8217;s most important races, and have been straightforward to schedule. Miami is happy with its early May slot. Austin is a big, booming event to kick off the late-season visit to the Americas. Las Vegas will always be around the Thanksgiving period.</p><p class=\"ad-slug\">Advertisement</p><p id=\"mid3\" class=\"ad place-ad\"></p><p>Miami does avoid the grueling, illogical back-to-back with Azerbaijan from this year &#8212; a consequence of China&#8217;s addition to the provisional schedule &#8212; but one question that lingers is why Canada, the fourth North American race, remains a standalone.</p><p>Efforts have been made in each of the past two years to try and get Canada to move earlier, forming a back-to-back with Miami. The pairing would make sense, yet there is no interest from officials in Montreal, reaching up to the highest levels of government, to move from its traditional mid-June slot.

            "text": "The current Formula One season is not even at its halfway point, yet eyes are turning to next year with today\u2019s announcement of the 2024 race schedule.\n\nWednesday\u2019s calendar announcement following the latest meeting of the FIA World Motor Sport Council, the regulatory body that must approve the schedule, means dates can now be put in the diary for next year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe United States will again host three races as Miami (May 5), Austin (October 20) and Las Vegas (November 23) retain their usual date slots, but elsewhere, there are some big changes. The Chinese Grand Prix will return for the first time since 2019, while Japan moves from its long-held fall date slot to the early part of the season. At the start of the season, both Bahrain and Saudi Arabia will be Saturday races. Later this year, F1 will announce which weekends will feature Sprint races.\n\n24 races in 2024 with big steps forward in regionalisation \ud83c\udf0f Introducing next year\u2019s Formula 1 calendar \ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f#F1 pic.twitter.com/JTSWJL29yH \u2014 Formula 1 (@F1) July 5, 2023\n\nAt a record 24 races, the 2024 calendar will be the toughest yet for F1. Efforts have been made to regionalize the schedule better \u2014 bunching together races in the same parts of the world \u2014 aiding logistics and the toll it places on the thousands of people traveling from event to event. But a number of big pressures make the \u2018perfect calendar\u2019 hard to achieve.\n\nThis is how F1 ended up with its longest, most intricate calendar to date.\n\nRamadan forces Saturday races\n\nA big scheduling headache for F1 going into 2024 was the timing of Ramadan. Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have opened the season since 2022, taking place before the start of the holy month. But as this begins on March 10 next year, squeezing both races in before that date looked like a challenge. By the end of Ramadan on April 9, conditions in the region would be too hot.\n\nAt one point, it looked like Saudi Arabia would open the season and that Bahrain would shift to later in the year. But F1 found a way to squeeze both in before the start of Ramadan by shifting them to Saturday races \u2014 that puts the Saudi GP on March 9. There is still the usual gap to travel between the two races. As pre-season testing is also poised to be held in Bahrain again, from February 21-23, it will create a three-week run in the Middle East for the paddock to start the year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis year\u2019s Las Vegas Grand Prix will take place on a Saturday night, in a bid to capture the late-night audience, and will be the first Saturday race since the 1985 South African Grand Prix. But the Saturday shift for Bahrain and Saudi Arabia is solely down to Ramadan, and not a long-term consideration for the future.\n\nChina returns, Japan moves\n\nWhile China was listed on the provisional calendar for 2023, its return was never likely until the country changed its Covid-19 restrictions. Now that it has abandoned its zero-Covid policy and is welcoming major international sporting events again, such as the ATP tennis tour, the grand prix will return for the first time since 2019.\n\nIt will give China\u2019s first F1 driver, Zhou Guanyu, a long-awaited chance to race in front of his home fans. But question marks remain over the long-term future of the race future beyond the end of its existing contract, which expires in 2025, given interest from new markets in Asia such as South Korea.\n\nJapan\u2019s move is also notable. The race had previously been staunch about wanting a fall date, but this also coincided with periods of bad weather. In 2019, Saturday\u2019s events had to be called off due to the threat of a typhoon, while torrential rain meant only 28 laps of the grand prix could be completed. Moving to April should bring better weather, and also gives a chance of coinciding with Japan\u2019s cherry blossom season.\n\nAlthough Japan fits better geographically with Australia and China from a logistics point of view, making all three races standalone events will add to the air miles clocked up by paddock personnel should they opt to return home between each race. The alternative is more time away from home, which is not always viable or in the best interest of the team.\n\nWhere the American races fit in\n\nMiami, Austin and Las Vegas are three of F1\u2019s most important races, and have been straightforward to schedule. Miami is happy with its early May slot. Austin is a big, booming event to kick off the late-season visit to the Americas. Las Vegas will always be around the Thanksgiving period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiami does avoid the grueling, illogical back-to-back with Azerbaijan from this year \u2014 a consequence of China\u2019s addition to the provisional schedule \u2014 but one question that lingers is why Canada, the fourth North American race, remains a standalone.\n\nEfforts have been made in each of the past two years to try and get Canada to move earlier, forming a back-to-back with Miami. The pairing would make sense, yet there is no interest from officials in Montreal, reaching up to the highest levels of government, to move from its traditional mid-June slot. The colder weather in May is one consideration \u2014 average temperatures are around 10\u00baF lower \u2014 and sticking to the same slot each year creates \u2018date equity\u2019, meaning a city will be able to bank on when a busy period will be. As a result, Canada stays in mid-June.\n\nThere have been some more sensible moves. Qatar\u2019s shift to pair with Abu Dhabi at the end of the season is a really good breakthrough for F1, avoiding its somewhat odd placement this year as a standalone between Singapore/Japan and the Americas. The European schedule remains largely unchanged, the only tweak being Spain\u2019s move to late June instead of early June, now forming a triple-header with Austria and Great Britain.\n\nThe four-week gap in October between Singapore and Austin offers some late respite that should benefit teams, similar to this year\u2019s April break. The trade-off is the season does not finish until December 8, when Abu Dhabi caps off a triple-header featuring Las Vegas and Qatar.\n\nOnce post-season testing is finished, team personnel won\u2019t be home until two weeks before Christmas. It also means January is the only month in 2024 without some kind of F1 running, with testing planned to take place in the final week of February. Add in car launches in the weeks prior to testing, and it makes for a full-on year.\n\nThe sustainability question\n\nIn F1\u2019s bid to achieve net zero carbon by 2030, the calendar is set to play a huge role. The cars themselves account for less than 1 per cent of emissions, the majority being down to logistics (45 percent) and business travel (28 percent).\n\nF1 has reviewed every single piece of kit it takes to races to ask if it can be redesigned or packed in a different way to reduce the amount of freight it uses. A new F1 motorhome was designed with efficiency in mind as a model teams could adopt in the future. In Austria, F1 trialed a new low-carbon energy generation system to power the paddock, targeting a 95 percent cut in emissions. F1\u2019s logistics partner, DHL, has also switched to biofuel-powered trucks this year.\n\nGO DEEPER \u2018A warning shot\u2019: Imola floods preview how a changing climate can threaten F1\n\nBut the calendar is where the biggest gains are going to be made. It\u2019s not going to be the work of an instant, and will take time to truly regionalize the schedule. Yet it remains a primary concern for F1 president and CEO Stefano Domenicali.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is also the question of human sustainability. At a time when wellbeing and mental health is in the spotlight more than ever, teams are conscious of the toll such a big calendar can have on personnel. Teams have dedicated wellbeing groups to look after their staff, and many implement rotation where they can, allowing people to take races off and get more time at home. But it is not possible with all roles. Take the race engineers: The drivers need the same support and voice on the other side of the radio at every single race, making it the kind of role that cannot be rotated.\n\nAt 24, F1 is at its upper limit of races, as defined in the Concorde Agreement that is the commercial terms between the various stakeholders. Pushing to 25 has been floated in the past, but there are no serious thoughts to go much beyond that. While more races paying hosting fees brings obvious commercial benefits, the feeling is F1 has now reached the limit of what is possible.\n\nThere are positive changes on the calendar for 2024 from a logistics and sustainability point of view.

            "article_html": "<div><p id=\"j0tTZT\">Formula 1 heads to Red Bull Ring this week, for the Austrian Grand Prix. When you consider their current for and the fact that this is their home grand prix, it is a safe assumption that Max Verstappen, Sergio P&#233;rez and company will be in top form this week.</p>\n<p id=\"RmTfFX\">But will they win again, and again, and again?</p>\n<p id=\"wUP2De\">That is one of many storylines as we look ahead to the Austrian Grand Prix. </p>\n<h3 id=\"gGbRBT\">Can Red Bull sweep the season?</h3>\n<p id=\"L17mk9\">If you have found yourself bored by the F1 season this year fear not, you are not alone. With Red Bull having won every race this year, and Verstappen seeking his fifth-straight victory, it has been rather dull at the front of the field each week. Over the past week alone, voices around the sport have shared their frustrations, from former F1 owner and current analyst <a href=\"https://www.planetf1.com/news/eddie-jordan-bored-max-verstappen-domination-michael-schumacher/\">Eddie Jordan</a>, to <a href=\"https://www.racefans.net/2023/06/22/i-understand-if-people-get-bored-i-want-good-competition-too-verstappen/\">Verstappen himself</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"ZAAIMc\">But while we wait for someone &#8212; anyone &#8212; to challenge Red Bull at the front of the field, perhaps a fall-back plan could be this: Finding excitement in Red Bull&#8217;s chase of history. After all, no team has swept the season in all of F1 history, and if Red Bull rattles off 14 more victories, they would be the first team to accomplish that feat. </p>\n<p id=\"dbflIC\">It might not be much, but it&#8217;s something. </p>\n<h3 id=\"ACnzYf\">P&#233;rez under pressure, redux</h3>\n  \n  <span class=\"e-image__inner\"><span class=\"e-image__image \">\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<img alt=\"F1 Grand Prix of Canada - Final Practice\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9MZJ1JtIQ2aMhj1AYypc2yzbaxA=/0x0:5677x3785/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:5677x3785):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24745979/1499200557.jpg\">\n\n\n\n      \n    </span></span>\n\n<p id=\"woWHeT\">Given what we just discussed, you would think everything was coming up roses over at Red Bull right now.</p>\n<p id=\"gk03Ah\">However, that is not exactly the case.</p>\n<p id=\"RySXoe\">The past few grands prix have not been kind to Sergio P&#233;rez, which has opened the door to speculation about his future with the team. Such speculation is part of life in F1, and something that P&#233;rez is certainly no stranger to. But with the gap between him and Verstappen in the Drivers&#8217; standings increasing &#8212; and the gap between him and Fernando Alonso in those same standings shrinking &#8212; many have begun to wonder just how secure his position is with the team.</p>\n<p id=\"9lsAgF\">At the moment, thinking that anyone besides P&#233;rez will be in this season next season seems far-fetched. While he has admittedly struggled in recent weeks, he is under contract with the team through 2024. Let&#8217;s not forget, while Verstappen has won six races this year, it is P&#233;rez who has won the other two, something Team Principal <a href=\"https://www.planetf1.com/news/christian-horner-naysayers-sergio-perez-class/\">Christian Horner pointed out</a> last week. Verstappen is the dominant force in the sport right now, but P&#233;rez is perhaps the ideal teammate for him, and the ideal second driver for Red Bull.</p>\n<p id=\"y14sTR\">Until he regains the form he showed earlier this year, however, that speculation will only continue.</p>\n<p id=\"TWYY1i\">And if he struggles even more? That speculation will only grow louder. </p>\n<p id=\"oXiLa3\">That&#8217;s just part of life in F1. </p>\n<h3 id=\"n3hpue\">Time for Mercedes to start winning?</h3>\n<p id=\"sJDpck\">Ever since the Silver Arrows brought their long-awaited upgrades to the Monaco Grand Prix, things have been looking up for Mercedes. They notched a P4 and P5 in Monaco with Lewis Hamilton finishing just ahead of George Russell, secured their first double podium of the year in the Spanish Grand Prix, and while Russell was forced to retire in Montreal, Hamilton secured another podium in the Canadian Grand Prix.</p>\n<p id=\"G9vsJ4\">However, fighting for podiums is not where Mercedes truly wants to be, after all. They would much rather be fighting for victories.</p>\n<p id=\"JHke9S\">But does Red Bull Ring give them their first true chance at a win?</p>\n<p id=\"N7CCZd\">That was the word out of Brackley last week, in the <a href=\"https://www.sbnation.com/formula-one/2023/6/21/23768752/f1-news-mercedes-lewis-hamilton-toto-wolff-george-russell\">team&#8217;s video debrief</a> of the Canadian Grand Prix. Mike Elliott, the team&#8217;s Chief Technical Officer, pointed to both the Austrian Grand Prix, and their home race at Silverstone, as opportunities for the team to push towards the front. </p>\n<p id=\"xIE1oH\">The reason? The configurations of both tracks. While the W14 has, in Hamilton&#8217;s words, &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.sbnation.com/formula-one/2023/6/21/23768752/f1-news-mercedes-lewis-hamilton-toto-wolff-george-russell\">sucked</a>&#8221; in low-speed corners, higher-speed corners have seen better performance from the W14. Both Red Bull Ring and Silverstone look to be better tracks for the W14.</p>\n<p id=\"wWNjpr\">Could this be the week Mercedes finally breaks through?</p>\n<h3 id=\"gOztAd\">Is this the week we see a Hamilton contract extension?</h3>\n<p id=\"KamiLo\">When the wins come is not the only question facing Mercedes. The other looming issue? A next contract for Hamilton. The seven-time champion sees his current deal with the Silver Arrows come to an end at the end of this season, but both the driver and the team have hinted in recent weeks that a new contract is close.</p>\n<p id=\"VC3BKs\">Some believe that this is all building to an <a href=\"https://www.planetf1.com/news/lewis-hamilton-contract-rumoured-announcement-venue/\">announcement at the British Grand Prix</a>, one of the <a href=\"https://www.mercedesamgf1.com/races/british-grand-prix-2023\">home races</a> for Mercedes, set for July 9. That certainly does make a degree of sense, and one can only imagine the scene at Silverstone all weekend long if such an announcement is made.</p>\n<p id=\"gWKQfe\">However, there is precedent to the team and Hamilton announcing a new deal at Red Bull Ring. After all, the contract which runs out at the end of the season? Mercedes announced that deal <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516590&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.formula1.com%2Fen%2Flatest%2Farticle.breaking-hamilton-agrees-new-two-year-contract-with-mercedes.5XURLL7ShyqezkYgf9eztg.html&amp;referrer=sbnation.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sbnation.com%2Fformula-one%2F2023%2F6%2F26%2F23770170%2Fferraris-floor-hamiltons-contract-and-more-f1-storylines-for-the-austrian-grand-prix\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ahead of the 2021 Austrian Grand Prix</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"C3s66w\">Does history repeat itself this week, or will we see the announcement come at home for Mercedes?</p>\n<h3 id=\"63BzJ9\">Has Ferrari figured things out?</h3>\n  \n  <span class=\"e-image__inner\"><span class=\"e-image__image \">\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<img alt=\"F1 Grand Prix of Canada\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LlJpkD-IEnRSxJ4X1T3NpW21gYg=/0x0:6000x4000/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:6000x4000):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24746065/1499541424.jpg\">\n\n\n\n      \n    </span></span>\n\n<p id=\"K0YfHc\">We talked about Mercedes potentially securing their first win of the season this week, but could this be the week where Ferrari breaks through?</p>\n<p id=\"PkILiS\">You might not have thought that possible after qualifying in Montreal. Charles Leclerc failed to advance to Q3 and was admittedly &#8220;frustrated&#8221; with the team after some tyre decisions made during Q2. Carlos Sainz Jr. did advance to Q3, but received a three-place grid penalty for impeding Pierre Gasly during Q1, and ended up starting 11th.</p>\n<p id=\"mTCmQf\">Yet on Sunday in the Canadian Grand Prix, the duo found their way to the front and finished in the top five, with Leclerc in P4 and Sainz in P5. Not only did Ferrari make a smart strategic decision to keep both drivers out during the early safety car &#8212; a decision made while reportedly listening to their drivers&#8217; advice &#8212; Ferrari saw much better pace and tyre management. </p>\n<p id=\"UbWeiK\">Following the Canadian GP, many pointed to Ferrari as being much faster than expected, including Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko. &#8220;It certainly wasn&#8217;t easy. We had problems getting our tyres up to temperature, especially with the hard,&#8221; <a href=\"https://formu1a.uno/en/f1-news-helmut-marko-reveals-ferrari-was-fastest-on-both-compounds-in-canada/\">he told the media</a> in Canada. &#8220;The race was more difficult than we anticipated. I have to say, thank God Ferrari had to start so far back because they were actually the fastest on both compounds.&#8221;</p>\n<p id=\"i4vbOp\">The Scuderia are also <a href=\"https://www.gpblog.com/en/news/217197/ferrari-developing-brand-new-floor.html\">set to unveil a new floor</a> for the SF-23 during a filming/testing session on Tuesday, which could make their pace even better. It remain unclear whether the team will also bring that to Red Bull Ring, or wait until a later race. </p>\n<p id=\"lwTfwT\">Still, there is renewed hope that Ferrari could have brighter days ahead. </p>\n<h3 id=\"BZtnaD\">McLaren upgrades?</h3>\n<p id=\"kl8inx\">Upgrades are to the F1 world what the offseason is to the NFL world. </p>\n<p id=\"gWAWUe\">Hope.</p>\n<p id=\"VqVS5O\">Every offseason, fans of all 32 teams begin to talk themselves into next year being &#8220;the year.&#8221; How? Through free agency and the NFL draft. With just the right additions during both events, a losing team can become a playoff contender in a matter of weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"NxbouS\">The same can be said for upgrades in the F1 world. With the right tweaks, a team running at the back of the field can shave off some much-needed time, and start pushing towards the front. As a matter of fact, we just ended the Ferrari section talking about hope. </p>\n<p id=\"Gv4J3T\">That leads us to McLaren, who have been talking about upgrades to the MCL60 since pre-season testing. They brought some tweaks to the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, as Lando Norris described to me ahead of that race, but following a heart-breaking finish in Montreal &#8212; where Norris finished in the points but was given a five-second penalty for &#8220;unsportsmanlike conduct&#8221; which dropped him from P8 to P13 &#8212; Team Principal Andrea Stella teased some soon-to-be-revealed upgrades.</p>\n<p id=\"K9Dm01\">And made some promises as well:</p>\n<p id=\"HEE9lb\">We will see if the incoming upgrades allow the team to &#8220;gain that considerable amount of lap time&#8221; that Stella promises.</p>\n<p id=\"3i4rZA\">But for now, the Papaya Army can, well, hope. </p>\n<h3 id=\"nhDjND\">Can Haas duplicate their Saturday pace on Sunday?</h3>\n  \n  <span class=\"e-image__inner\"><span class=\"e-image__image \">\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<img alt=\"F1 Grand Prix Of Canada Practice 3\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ZmOmiGo9iI8ovmaPZK7p1f9-nI=/0x0:3310x2207/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:3310x2207):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24748856/1258770593.jpg\">\n\n\n\n      \n    </span></span>\n\n<p id=\"vXwyXH\">At nearly each Grand Prix this year, it has been a tale of two weekends for Haas. </p>\n<p id=\"TcnhS2\">Strong on Saturday, sliding back on Sunday.</p>\n<p id=\"j3Su29\">The Canadian Grand Prix was perhaps the strongest example. Nico H&#252;lkenberg caught a little bit of luck in Q3 in Montreal, and qualified on the front row alongside Max Verstappen. </p>\n<p id=\"oJHujB\">A three-place penalty for failing to properly slow down under a red flag dropped H&#252;lkenberg down to fifth, but he still began Sunday in position to secure some much-needed points for the team.</p>\n<p id=\"Di2EoN\">Instead he slid back through the field, and out of the points.</p>\n<p id=\"ydO7sn\">Haas has strong one-lap pace this year, which has served them fairly well on Saturdays. But they cannot seem to find the race pace they need to consistently challenge for points. </p>\n<p id=\"841V6w\">&#8220;It was a one-way street in the wrong direction today. It was to some extent expected, but we obviously always hope for the best so that it&#8217;s better than what you had in the previous event,&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.haasf1team.com/news/canadian-grand-prix-race-recap-1\">said H&#252;lkenberg</a> after the Canadian Grand Prix. &#8220;It just once again confirms that we have a lot of work to do on the long run pace and entire consistency because that&#8217;s really hurting our Sunday.&#8221;</p>\n<p id=\"P7MALG\">&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty clear now, obviously the result is not what we should be doing and it&#8217;s very disappointing. I think we know where to look, the issue is as soon as we get into traffic and behind cars, our degradation is immense, we cannot get the tire performance back and we just slip back,&#8221; added Team Principal Guenther Steiner. </p>\n<p id=\"e5QGLI\">&#8220;We can clearly see it, as soon as we get away from free air and start to fight, we just degrade,&#8221; added the Haas boss. &#8220;We know really what we need to look for, and we&#8217;ll be looking for it. We need to put our heads together and try to find a solution to this and not hide behind good qualifying results.&#8221;</p>\n<p id=\"BciUrx\">The team needs to find a solution, and fast. Can they do it in time to challenge for points at Red Bull Ring?</p>\n<h3 id=\"Hi2CZK\"></h3>\n  \n</div>",

Over the past week alone, voices around the sport have shared their frustrations, from former F1 owner and current analyst Eddie Jordan, to Verstappen himself.\n\nBut while we wait for someone \u2014 anyone \u2014 to challenge Red Bull at the front of the field, perhaps a fall-back plan could be this: Finding excitement in Red Bull\u2019s chase of history. After all, no team has swept the season in all of F1 history, and if Red Bull rattles off 14 more victories, they would be the first team to accomplish that feat.\n\nIt might not be much, but it\u2019s something.\n\nP\u00e9rez under pressure, redux\n\nGiven what we just discussed, you would think everything was coming up roses over at Red Bull right now.\n\nHowever, that is not exactly the case.\n\nThe past few grands prix have not been kind to Sergio P\u00e9rez, which has opened the door to speculation about his future with the team. Such speculation is part of life in F1, and something that P\u00e9rez is certainly no stranger to. But with the gap between him and Verstappen in the Drivers\u2019 standings increasing \u2014 and the gap between him and Fernando Alonso in those same standings shrinking \u2014 many have begun to wonder just how secure his position is with the team.\n\nAt the moment, thinking that anyone besides P\u00e9rez will be in this season next season seems far-fetched. While he has admittedly struggled in recent weeks, he is under contract with the team through 2024. Let\u2019s not forget, while Verstappen has won six races this year, it is P\u00e9rez who has won the other two, something Team Principal Christian Horner pointed out last week. Verstappen is the dominant force in the sport right now, but P\u00e9rez is perhaps the ideal teammate for him, and the ideal second driver for Red Bull.\n\nUntil he regains the form he showed earlier this year, however, that speculation will only continue.\n\nAnd if he struggles even more? That speculation will only grow louder.\n\nThat\u2019s just part of life in F1.\n\nTime for Mercedes to start winning?\n\nEver since the Silver Arrows brought their long-awaited upgrades to the Monaco Grand Prix, things have been looking up for Mercedes. They notched a P4 and P5 in Monaco with Lewis Hamilton finishing just ahead of George Russell, secured their first double podium of the year in the Spanish Grand Prix, and while Russell was forced to retire in Montreal, Hamilton secured another podium in the Canadian Grand Prix.\n\nHowever, fighting for podiums is not where Mercedes truly wants to be, after all. They would much rather be fighting for victories.\n\nBut does Red Bull Ring give them their first true chance at a win?\n\nThat was the word out of Brackley last week, in the team\u2019s video debrief of the Canadian Grand Prix. Mike Elliott, the team\u2019s Chief Technical Officer, pointed to both the Austrian Grand Prix, and their home race at Silverstone, as opportunities for the team to push towards the front.\n\nThe reason? The configurations of both tracks. While the W14 has, in Hamilton\u2019s words, \u201csucked\u201d in low-speed corners, higher-speed corners have seen better performance from the W14. Both Red Bull Ring and Silverstone look to be better tracks for the W14.\n\nCould this be the week Mercedes finally breaks through?\n\nIs this the week we see a Hamilton contract extension?\n\nWhen the wins come is not the only question facing Mercedes. The other looming issue? A next contract for Hamilton. The seven-time champion sees his current deal with the Silver Arrows come to an end at the end of this season, but both the driver and the team have hinted in recent weeks that a new contract is close.\n\nSome believe that this is all building to an announcement at the British Grand Prix, one of the home races for Mercedes, set for July 9. That certainly does make a degree of sense, and one can only imagine the scene at Silverstone all weekend long if such an announcement is made.\n\nHowever, there is precedent to the team and Hamilton announcing a new deal at Red Bull Ring. After all, the contract which runs out at the end of the season? Mercedes announced that deal ahead of the 2021 Austrian Grand Prix.\n\nDoes history repeat itself this week, or will we see the announcement come at home for Mercedes?\n\nHas Ferrari figured things out?\n\nWe talked about Mercedes potentially securing their first win of the season this week, but could this be the week where Ferrari breaks through?\n\nYou might not have thought that possible after qualifying in Montreal. Charles Leclerc failed to advance to Q3 and was admittedly \u201cfrustrated\u201d with the team after some tyre decisions made during Q2. Carlos Sainz Jr. did advance to Q3, but received a three-place grid penalty for impeding Pierre Gasly during Q1, and ended up starting 11th.\n\nYet on Sunday in the Canadian Grand Prix, the duo found their way to the front and finished in the top five, with Leclerc in P4 and Sainz in P5. Not only did Ferrari make a smart strategic decision to keep both drivers out during the early safety car \u2014 a decision made while reportedly listening to their drivers\u2019 advice \u2014 Ferrari saw much better pace and tyre management.\n\nFollowing the Canadian GP, many pointed to Ferrari as being much faster than expected, including Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko. \u201cIt certainly wasn\u2019t easy. We had problems getting our tyres up to temperature, especially with the hard,\u201d he told the media in Canada. \u201cThe race was more difficult than we anticipated. I have to say, thank God Ferrari had to start so far back because they were actually the fastest on both compounds.\u201d\n\nThe Scuderia are also set to unveil a new floor for the SF-23 during a filming/testing session on Tuesday, which could make their pace even better. It remain unclear whether the team will also bring that to Red Bull Ring, or wait until a later race.\n\nStill, there is renewed hope that Ferrari could have brighter days ahead.\n\nMcLaren upgrades?\n\nUpgrades are to the F1 world what the offseason is to the NFL world.\n\nHope.\n\nEvery offseason, fans of all 32 teams begin to talk themselves into next year being \u201cthe year.\u201d How? Through free agency and the NFL draft. With just the right additions during both events, a losing team can become a playoff contender in a matter of weeks.\n\nThe same can be said for upgrades in the F1 world. With the right tweaks, a team running at the back of the field can shave off some much-needed time, and start pushing towards the front. As a matter of fact, we just ended the Ferrari section talking about hope.\n\nThat leads us to McLaren, who have been talking about upgrades to the MCL60 since pre-season testing. They brought some tweaks to the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, as Lando Norris described to me ahead of that race, but following a heart-breaking finish in Montreal \u2014 where Norris finished in the points but was given a five-second penalty for \u201cunsportsmanlike conduct\u201d which dropped him from P8 to P13 \u2014 Team Principal Andrea Stella teased some soon-to-be-revealed upgrades.\n\nAnd made some promises as well:\n\nWe will see if the incoming upgrades allow the team to \u201cgain that considerable amount of lap time\u201d that Stella promises.\n\nBut for now, the Papaya Army can, well, hope.\n\nCan Haas duplicate their Saturday pace on Sunday?\n\nAt nearly each Grand Prix this year, it has been a tale of two weekends for Haas.\n\nStrong on Saturday, sliding back on Sunday.\n\nThe Canadian Grand Prix was perhaps the strongest example. Nico H\u00fclkenberg caught a little bit of luck in Q3 in Montreal, and qualified on the front row alongside Max Verstappen.\n\nA three-place penalty for failing to properly slow down under a red flag dropped H\u00fclkenberg down to fifth, but he still began Sunday in position to secure some much-needed points for the team.\n\nInstead he slid back through the field, and out of the points.\n\nHaas has strong one-lap pace this year, which has served them fairly well on Saturdays. But they cannot seem to find the race pace they need to consistently challenge for points.\n\n\u201cIt was a one-way street in the wrong direction today. It was to some extent expected, but we obviously always hope for the best so that it\u2019s better than what you had in the previous event,\u201d said H\u00fclkenberg after the Canadian Grand Prix. \u201cIt just once again confirms that we have a lot of work to do on the long run pace and entire consistency because that\u2019s really hurting our Sunday.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear now, obviously the result is not what we should be doing and it\u2019s very disappointing. I think we know where to look, the issue is as soon as we get into traffic and behind cars, our degradation is immense, we cannot get the tire performance back and we just slip back,\u201d added Team Principal Guenther Steiner.\n\n\u201cWe can clearly see it, as soon as we get away from free air and start to fight, we just degrade,\u201d added the Haas boss. \u201cWe know really what we need to look for, and we\u2019ll be looking for it. We need to put our heads together and try to find a solution to this and not hide behind good qualifying results.\u201d\n\nThe team needs to find a solution, and fast. Can they do it in time to challenge for points at Red Bull Ring?",
