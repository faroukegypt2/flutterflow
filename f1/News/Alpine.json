It sat in sixth place, more than 50 points behind fourth-place Ferrari.</p><p class=\"ad-slug\">Advertisement</p><p id=\"mid2\" class=\"ad place-ad\"></p><p>Based on Rossi&#8217;s remarks, it sounded as if Alpine was way off the mark. In reality, the team is more in the mix with a plan in place. Gasly and Ocon&#8217;s double-points finish in Miami seemed the beginning of a turnaround.</p><p>&#8220;It is a brand with a lot of history and a brand with commitment. People who are competitive in what they do and that are petrolheads in general,&#8221; Ocon said to <i>The Athletic</i> in Miami. &#8220;We are a bunch of racers, as the team calls itself. I&#8217;m completely part of the challenge that we are going through and part of the aim that we want to be fighting out the front.</p><p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the aim for the team.&#8221;</p><h2>The &#8216;100-race project&#8217;</h2><p>Alpine entered the Formula One scene in 2021 when the Renault Group rebranded its F1 team with the name of its sports car brand, not only changing the name and livery but also bringing back Fernando Alonso for his third Enstone stint.</p><p>Apart from its maiden win (secured by Ocon in Hungary), Alpine hadn&#8217;t threatened the podium come mid-fall, but it was no cause for panic. In a mid-October <a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.its-a-100-race-project-ceo-laurent-rossi-outlines-alpines-roadmap-to-reach.2TA0a4d491WWAjbuzsDTzw.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">interview with F1.com</a>, Rossi revealed his team&#8217;s roadmap &#8220;to reach a level of competitiveness that places us on the podium as many times as possible in 2024.&#8221; He called it the &#8220;100-race project.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Every race, we must make progress. It can be progress you see on the track or progress you don&#8217;t see, all the little details. The idea is to never stop &#8212; and be able to see we&#8217;re going in the right direction. Next year, it&#8217;ll be a coin-tossing year,&#8221; Rossi said. &#8220;All we want is to make sure we have a satisfactory level of performance when we start, which doesn&#8217;t put us too far from the top. And then from there, we can carry on our climb to the summit.&#8221;</p><p>Alpine&#8217;s second podium finish of 2021 came in November when Alonso secured third in Qatar. The Enstone-based team ended the year in fifth place, more than 100 points off of McLaren and nearly 170 from third-place Ferrari. But it was a first step, as there were only two races that season where Alpine walked away scoreless. Its forward progression continued in 2022: The team went winless and podium-less, but Ocon and Alonso steadily recorded points, amassing 18 more than in 2021. It resulted in a fourth-place finish as its battle with McLaren came down to the final races.</p><img class=\"wp-image-4672062 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/07/06161822/GettyImages-1475061658.jpg\" alt=\"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 19: Esteban Ocon of France driving the (31) Alpine A523 Renault and Pierre Gasly of France driving the (10) Alpine F1 A523 Renaulton track during the F1 Grand Prix of Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Corniche Circuit on March 19, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

As Alpine struggled in the early races, it saw its shot at fourth place put at risk not by McLaren but by Aston Martin. Alpine &#8212; along with the rest of the paddock &#8212; was stunned to see the team surge from its seventh-place finish in 2022 to such a strong start, <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/4424739/2023/04/19/fernando-alonso-como-33/\">it spent the first stretch of 2023 in second place</a>. (Aston has since dropped to third, behind <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/4579545/2023/06/04/spanish-grand-prix-mercedes-upgrades/\">a rebounding Mercedes</a>.)</p><p class=\"ad-slug\">Advertisement</p><p id=\"mid3\" class=\"ad place-ad\"></p><p>&#8220;I think it was a reality check for Mercedes, Ferrari, us,&#8221; Rossi said last week. &#8220;We were comfortable thinking that we were on the rise and everybody else was, and then suddenly there is a guy leapfrogging all of us.&#8221;</p><p>Alpine needs to &#8220;emulate&#8221; Aston Martin&#8217;s moves, such as speeding up processes and taking risks, Rossi said, but in its own way. Alpine is a works team, meaning it&#8217;s run by a manufacturer and has its own in-house engine supply.</p><p>Part of what Alpine began questioning about its own operations is the speed certain tasks, like car upgrades. &#8220;People start scratching their heads a bit more thinking: &#8216;Maybe we are being a bit too conservative here, maybe we are doing too many validations, maybe we can shorten the process here and there,'&#8221; Rossi said.</p><p>&#8220;You realize that over time you have built so many extra cautious steps because you addressed a problem one day and said to yourself: &#8216;OK, next time we do this all the time.&#8217; And now you look at it and you are like, with hindsight, maybe this is not necessary anymore.&#8221;</p><p>The Enstone-based team also has a new group of high-profile investors, including Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/4641448/2023/06/26/ryan-reynolds-rob-mcelhenney-alpine-investment-f1/\">buying a 24% stake in the team</a>, which <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/4640480/2023/06/26/wrexham-owners-alpine-stake-formula-1/\">Rossi said will help Alpine &#8220;accelerate&#8221;</a> its 100-race plan.</p><p>However, the plan may be extended beyond the initial 100 races, a number it will hit next season.</p><p>&#8220;My goal is by 2025 the Alpine F1 team has the same means as the top teams and is operating in a way that they can put those means to work to become a credible contender for the podium. That&#8217;s it,&#8221; Rossi said. &#8220;And we are still going in that direction. We are still hiring, getting equipment and resources and this investment will help us go even faster.</p><p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why I feel we are still on track.&#8221;</p><h2>&#8216;Underrating underdogs&#8217;</h2><p>Heading into the Canadian Grand Prix weekend in mid-June, the mood seemed vastly different for Alpine compared to Miami six weeks earlier. Ocon and Gasly had recorded a combined 26 points in Monaco and Spain, a majority of the haul thanks to Ocon&#8217;s podium in Monte Carlo.</p><p class=\"ad-slug\">Advertisement</p><p id=\"mid4\" class=\"ad place-ad\"></p><p>That&#8217;s nearly double the points they scored in the first five races. And while second place for the constructors&#8217; championship has been a battle between Aston Martin, Ferrari and Mercedes, Carlos Sainz told <a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.leclerc-not-expecting-any-miracles-for-ferrari-in-canada-as-sainz-predicts.50VBuZY3RLDdTuLAGIO2vh.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">formula1.com</a>, in Montr&#233;al that he felt Alpine &#8220;are very, very close to joining that battle.&#8221;</p><p>Team principal Otmar Szafnauer tamped down such hype. &#8220;We set our targets for fourth in the championship,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re not there, we&#8217;re still quite a distance from fourth, so we have to continue to improve the car and make sure that the underlying pace is there such that we can score good points and see where that takes us.&#8221;</p><img class=\"wp-image-4672064 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/07/06161840/GettyImages-1494525444.jpg\" alt=\"MONACO, MONACO - MAY 28: Third placed Esteban Ocon of France and Alpine F1 celebrates with his team in parc ferme after the F1 Grand Prix of Monaco at Circuit of Monaco on May 28, 2023 in Monaco, Monaco.

(Dan Istitene &#8211; Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images)</p><p>The goal right now for the Enstone-based crew is Ocon and Gasly both making it to Q3 and finishing in points, Szafnauer said. So far this season, the duo have finished in points together four times in nine races, but the qualifying performance has improved.</p><p>It boils down to maximizing potential.</p><p>&#8220;I think we definitely didn&#8217;t start the season where we wanted, but we&#8217;ve done a massive step forward, especially on Saturdays. I feel that our qualifying pace is strong. It has been strong in the last couple of events, and we are close to where we want to be in that sense,&#8221; Ocon said in Austria. &#8220;Where we still need more performance is in the races. I was fifth and fourth with George&#8217;s incident in Canada, but the top-running cars, they were still pulling away lap by lap. That&#8217;s where we need to focus on. We know what we have to do, and there is a plan for upgrades coming up through the year. Each time we bring them, we make a step forward.&#8221;</p><p>Even with how the Canadian Grand Prix weekend unfolded &#8212; Gasly&#8217;s steering wheel issue in FP1, Sainz impeding Gasly during qualifying (resulting in a P15 start for the Frenchman), only Ocon bringing home points &#8212; there was still a feeling of optimism in the team&#8217;s hospitality building. Rossi looked like a proud father when talking about his two drivers before the race.</p><p>&#8220;They come from humble beginnings. They would have never had that chance. Because they believe in themselves and someone else believed in them, they succeeded,&#8221; Rossi said. When asked how much he believes in Ocon and Gasly, the answer was simple: &#8220;Immensely.&#8221;</p><p class=\"ad-slug\">Advertisement</p><p id=\"mid5\" class=\"ad place-ad\"></p><p>&#8220;I think those guys are underrating underdogs. It&#8217;s been their whole life, almost, the attributes that people have put on them, especially their sport. Their sport seems to value other type of personalities and people,&#8221; Rossi said. &#8220;But they&#8217;ve shown since the beginning of the year, their career really, that they&#8217;re highly reliable. They can climb on the podium whenever the opportunity arises.&#8221;</p><p>While Szafnauer fielded questions after the Canadian Grand Prix, ranging from Ocon&#8217;s rear wing to tires, Gasly made his rounds, saying goodbye as he prepared to leave the circuit. The team principal paused mid-answer when the Frenchman came to shake his hand, saying, &#8220;Tell these guys about the underlying race pace.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll see in Austria,&#8221; Gasly responded, eliciting laughs from a few members of the media.</p><p>It ended up being a subpar <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/tag/austrian-grand-prix-2023\">weekend in Spielberg for Alpine</a> as <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/4663072/2023/07/04/f1-austrian-gp-track-limits-penalties/\">post-race time penalties</a> caused Ocon and Gasly to fall in the race results, the latter of the duo bringing home one point. Rivals like McLaren brought upgrades to Austria, while Alpine has brought its upgrades to Silverstone this weekend &#8212; hoping to take another step forward and close the gap again.</p><p>&#8220;We are still focused on the teams in front of us, that&#8217;s very clear,&#8221; Ocon said after the Austrian GP, &#8220;but we can see that the teams behind are also pushing forward.&#8221;</p><p>A theme continues to echo where Alpine stands a third of the way through the 2023 season: Wait and see. They&#8217;re more in the mix than it seemed.</p><p>(Lead image: Photos: Clive Rose, Chris Graythen, Clive Mason, Dan Istitene/Formula 1 via Getty; Design: John Bradford)</p>\n</div>",

The Enstone-based team ended the year in fifth place, more than 100 points off of McLaren and nearly 170 from third-place Ferrari. But it was a first step, as there were only two races that season where Alpine walked away scoreless. Its forward progression continued in 2022: The team went winless and podium-less, but Ocon and Alonso steadily recorded points, amassing 18 more than in 2021. It resulted in a fourth-place finish as its battle with McLaren came down to the final races.\n\nIn October 2021, Alpine CEO Laurent Rossi revealed his team\u2019s roadmap \u201cto reach a level of competitiveness that places us on the podium as many times as possible in 2024.\u201d He called it the \u201c100-race project.\u201d (Photo by Eric Alonso/Getty Images)\n\nBut when 2023 kicked off, Alpine\u2019s upward climb seemed to stall despite the hype around its all-French F1 driver lineup \u2014 the first since 1995 (plus Gasly leaving the Red Bull family for the first time in his F1 career). As Alpine struggled in the early races, it saw its shot at fourth place put at risk not by McLaren but by Aston Martin. Alpine \u2014 along with the rest of the paddock \u2014 was stunned to see the team surge from its seventh-place finish in 2022 to such a strong start, it spent the first stretch of 2023 in second place. (Aston has since dropped to third, behind a rebounding Mercedes.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think it was a reality check for Mercedes, Ferrari, us,\u201d Rossi said last week. \u201cWe were comfortable thinking that we were on the rise and everybody else was, and then suddenly there is a guy leapfrogging all of us.\u201d\n\nAlpine needs to \u201cemulate\u201d Aston Martin\u2019s moves, such as speeding up processes and taking risks, Rossi said, but in its own way. Alpine is a works team, meaning it\u2019s run by a manufacturer and has its own in-house engine supply.\n\nPart of what Alpine began questioning about its own operations is the speed certain tasks, like car upgrades. \u201cPeople start scratching their heads a bit more thinking: \u2018Maybe we are being a bit too conservative here, maybe we are doing too many validations, maybe we can shorten the process here and there,'\u201d Rossi said.\n\n\u201cYou realize that over time you have built so many extra cautious steps because you addressed a problem one day and said to yourself: \u2018OK, next time we do this all the time.\u2019 And now you look at it and you are like, with hindsight, maybe this is not necessary anymore.\u201d\n\nThe Enstone-based team also has a new group of high-profile investors, including Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, buying a 24% stake in the team, which Rossi said will help Alpine \u201caccelerate\u201d its 100-race plan.\n\nHowever, the plan may be extended beyond the initial 100 races, a number it will hit next season.\n\n\u201cMy goal is by 2025 the Alpine F1 team has the same means as the top teams and is operating in a way that they can put those means to work to become a credible contender for the podium. That\u2019s it,\u201d Rossi said. \u201cAnd we are still going in that direction. We are still hiring, getting equipment and resources and this investment will help us go even faster.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I feel we are still on track.\u201d\n\n\u2018Underrating underdogs\u2019\n\nHeading into the Canadian Grand Prix weekend in mid-June, the mood seemed vastly different for Alpine compared to Miami six weeks earlier. Ocon and Gasly had recorded a combined 26 points in Monaco and Spain, a majority of the haul thanks to Ocon\u2019s podium in Monte Carlo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s nearly double the points they scored in the first five races. And while second place for the constructors\u2019 championship has been a battle between Aston Martin, Ferrari and Mercedes, Carlos Sainz told formula1.com, in Montr\u00e9al that he felt Alpine \u201care very, very close to joining that battle.\u201d\n\nTeam principal Otmar Szafnauer tamped down such hype. \u201cWe set our targets for fourth in the championship,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not there, we\u2019re still quite a distance from fourth, so we have to continue to improve the car and make sure that the underlying pace is there such that we can score good points and see where that takes us.\u201d\n\nOcon and Gasly recorded a combined 26 points in Monaco and Spain, a vast majority of the haul thanks to Ocon\u2019s podium in Monte Carlo. (Dan Istitene \u2013 Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images)\n\nThe goal right now for the Enstone-based crew is Ocon and Gasly both making it to Q3 and finishing in points, Szafnauer said. So far this season, the duo have finished in points together four times in nine races, but the qualifying performance has improved.\n\nIt boils down to maximizing potential.\n\n\u201cI think we definitely didn\u2019t start the season where we wanted, but we\u2019ve done a massive step forward, especially on Saturdays. I feel that our qualifying pace is strong. It has been strong in the last couple of events, and we are close to where we want to be in that sense,\u201d Ocon said in Austria. \u201cWhere we still need more performance is in the races. I was fifth and fourth with George\u2019s incident in Canada, but the top-running cars, they were still pulling away lap by lap. That\u2019s where we need to focus on. We know what we have to do, and there is a plan for upgrades coming up through the year. Each time we bring them, we make a step forward.\u201d\n\nEven with how the Canadian Grand Prix weekend unfolded \u2014 Gasly\u2019s steering wheel issue in FP1, Sainz impeding Gasly during qualifying (resulting in a P15 start for the Frenchman), only Ocon bringing home points \u2014 there was still a feeling of optimism in the team\u2019s hospitality building. Rossi looked like a proud father when talking about his two drivers before the race.\n\n\u201cThey come from humble beginnings. They would have never had that chance. Because they believe in themselves and someone else believed in them, they succeeded,\u201d Rossi said. When asked how much he believes in Ocon and Gasly, the answer was simple: \u201cImmensely.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think those guys are underrating underdogs. It\u2019s been their whole life, almost, the attributes that people have put on them, especially their sport. Their sport seems to value other type of personalities and people,\u201d Rossi said. \u201cBut they\u2019ve shown since the beginning of the year, their career really, that they\u2019re highly reliable. They can climb on the podium whenever the opportunity arises.\u201d\n\nWhile Szafnauer fielded questions after the Canadian Grand Prix, ranging from Ocon\u2019s rear wing to tires, Gasly made his rounds, saying goodbye as he prepared to leave the circuit. The team principal paused mid-answer when the Frenchman came to shake his hand, saying, \u201cTell these guys about the underlying race pace.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll see in Austria,\u201d Gasly responded, eliciting laughs from a few members of the media.\n\nIt ended up being a subpar weekend in Spielberg for Alpine as post-race time penalties caused Ocon and Gasly to fall in the race results, the latter of the duo bringing home one point. Rivals like McLaren brought upgrades to Austria, while Alpine has brought its upgrades to Silverstone this weekend \u2014 hoping to take another step forward and close the gap again.\n\n\u201cWe are still focused on the teams in front of us, that\u2019s very clear,\u201d Ocon said after the Austrian GP, \u201cbut we can see that the teams behind are also pushing forward.\u201d\n\nA theme continues to echo where Alpine stands a third of the way through the 2023 season: Wait and see. They\u2019re more in the mix than it seemed.\n\n(Lead image: Photos: Clive Rose, Chris Graythen, Clive Mason, Dan Istitene/Formula 1 via Getty; Design: John Bradford)",

            "text": "Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly left this weekend\u2019s Canadian Grand Prix disappointed for differing reasons. While Ocon was frustrated not to finish higher, Gasly was left ruing his poor luck that saw him unable to use the \u201cpotential\u201d in Alpine's package. Ocon started the race from sixth on the grid, but a fast start meant he jumped ahead of Nico Hulkenberg into fifth in the early stages \u2013 before gaining a place when George Russell crashed into the barrier. READ MORE: Magnussen and De Vries offer differing opinions on bizarre Montreal run-off moment However, after pitting for the hards in his first stop, he lost track position to the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz, as well as the Red Bull of Sergio Perez \u2013 with all three drivers staying out. And, after pitting for the second time, he ended up behind the one-stopping Alex Albon. Ocon then attempted to make his way past Albon in the closing stages of the race, but to no avail, with the Alpine racer forced to settle for eighth. And while he was happy to be back in the points, he was disappointed to not finish higher. Asked if he was pleased with the result, Ocon replied: \u201cPleased? No. Probably not. Happy to be in the points again, but we were fourth before all the rounds of stops. So, we need to review what happened, why we lost to all the other cars after the stops.\n\nThis feature is currently not available because you need to provide consent to functional cookies.

We can\u2019t try and do any moves. \u201cIt was good racing also with Lando [Norris] at the end. The consequence is we ended up behind, so we lost some points.

That season, he won the F3 title at the first attempt and followed in the footsteps of George Russell and Charles Leclerc by winning the F2 title the next year. It was an incredible rise.</p>\n<p>Over the last couple of years, Piastri has completed a strong testing programme in old F1 machinery, while also embedding himself in the team as reserve driver to prepare himself for when the opportunity arose to make the final step into a race seat.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s clear that Piastri is grateful to Alpine for the opportunity and support he&#8217;s received in developing him.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.mclaren-boss-seidl-reveals-key-factors-behind-piastri-signing-and-says-crb.3zu7bZDXwwbvx52qyLbIIm.html\">READ MORE: McLaren boss Seidl reveals key factors behind Piastri signing &#8211; and says CRB ruling &#8216;not really any surprise&#8217;</a></strong></p>\n<p>However, it is believed that while Alpine contributed to his pathway through F2 and F3, plus the running in F1 machinery, a big chunk of the financial support he has needed for successful campaigns in F3 and F2 came from family and sponsors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve really enjoyed my time with Alpine,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I joined the Academy off the back of winning the Formula Renault championship in 2019 as part of the prize for winning the championship, and enjoyed two incredibly successful years as part of the Academy with two further championships so I have nothing but respect for all the team at Enstone.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a good testing programme that we came up with with Alpine this year, in place of not having a seat for this year. It&#8217;s put me in good stead and I&#8217;m very thankful for Alpine for the testing we have done this year, but McLaren is a different team, a different car and the 2022 cars in general are quite different beasts so we&#8217;ll see how much of that carries over.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I will look back on my time at Enstone with great memories but I&#8217;m now focusing on my future and starting my F1 career.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"ABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 14: Oscar Piastri of Australia driving the (35) Alpine\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        Piastri took part in the end-of-season Abu Dhabi test with Alpine last year\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <h3>Piastri on&#8230; why he left Alpine</h3>\n<p>Alpine had offered Fernando Alonso a new deal, believed to be an additional year with an option for a second. Had the double world champion taken the offer, it would have meant Piastri would not drive an Alpine in 2023 or maybe not even in 2024. That would be three years without a seat in F1.</p>\n<p>So Piastri started to look elsewhere. In his and his management&#8217;s view, they didn&#8217;t have a contract to race for Alpine in 2023 and thus they needed to look elsewhere to secure a seat on the grid for that season.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.analysis-unpacking-the-piastri-alpine-mclaren-situation-after-the-crbs.5bleusu7Vy8c08DJtzlkr4.html\">ANALYSIS: Unpacking the Piastri-Alpine-McLaren situation after the CRB's ruling</a></strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;The CRB ruling has confirmed I didn&#8217;t have a contract for the 2023 season [with Alpine],&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was free to choose my destiny &#8211; and I felt McLaren was a great opportunity. They were very straightforward and very keen and enthusiastic to have me. To be completely honest, there was a lack of clarity around my future at the team at Alpine.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They publicly stated they wished to continue with Fernando for at least one or two more years. I respect that. But after spending the year out, my hopes were firmly set on an Alpine seat and the lack of clarity and, <a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.alonso-says-strange-feeling-of-protracted-alpine-negotiations-contributed-to.4csIj0fzNLEwlPyBhfvInN.html\">similarly to Fernando</a>, a bit of a strange feeling in negotiations, it didn&#8217;t feel like it was the right decision for me [to stay around].</p>\n<p>&#8220;The lack of clarity around my future, and ultimately a breakdown in trust, I felt the very attractive offer of McLaren and the positive dealings with them thus far were all reasons why I felt McLaren was where I was best off for the future.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"GettyImages-1358604947.jpg\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        Piastri won back-to-back F3 and F2 titles\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <h3>Piastri on&#8230; the simulator story and that tweet</h3>\n<p>Alpine were surprised when Alonso told them he was leaving for Aston Martin in 2023, but moved swiftly to announce Piastri would drive for them. However, the press release intriguingly didn&#8217;t feature a quote from Piastri...</p>\n<p>It has since emerged that prior to that announcement, Piastri and his management team had told Alpine on two previous occasions that he would not be driving for them next year, which is why Piastri was so disappointed with the way it was handled.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My decision was made well in advance [of Alonso&#8217;s departure], which made Alpine&#8217;s announcement probably even more confusing and upsetting because we had told the team that I wasn&#8217;t going to continue,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was quite upsetting as the announcement was false and it also denied me the opportunity to properly say goodbye to everyone at Enstone.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.watch-wins-overtakes-and-two-titles-in-a-row-the-best-moments-from-oscar.2NYuHKl81UXhNpzCvTrNjo.html\">WATCH: Wins, overtakes, and two titles in a row &#8211; The best moments from Oscar Piastri's career so far</a></strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I had been with team for a bit over two and a half years now, and for the rest of the team to find out I was leaving in that manner was very upsetting.

This is wrong and I have not signed a contract with Alpine for 2023. I will not be driving for Alpine next year.\"</p>\n<p>It was an unequivocal statement of his position.</p>\n<p>Piastri explained he felt he had to respond because the release &#8220;was false&#8221;.</p>\n<p>He added: &#8220;It was the biggest moment of my career and probably my life up to now. To have that falsely announced was something my management and I felt we had to correct and there was also potential legal implications if we didn&#8217;t deny the announcement.

            "text": "Oscar Piastri is considered by many in the paddock as a star of the future. On the outside, he comes across as relaxed and charming. Inside is a confident, talented and determined driver laser focused on honing himself into a world class Formula 1 driver. It was surprising to some, then, that when Alpine announced the Australian would make his F1 debut with them next year, replacing Fernando Alonso, Piastri responded by saying he would not drive for the French team next year. Why would he turn down the opportunity to fulfil a lifelong dream? As is usually the case in Formula 1, there was more to it. READ MORE: Piastri to race for McLaren in 2023 following CRB decision It soon emerged that the reigning F2 champion had already agreed to join McLaren, because at the time, he felt there was no seat available at Alpine for the foreseeable future. With both teams laying claim to him, the Contract Recognition Board was required \u2013 it is believed at the request of Alpine \u2013 and on Friday, they revealed it was McLaren who had the valid contract with Piastri, and it was subsequently announced he would drive for them. \u201cI\u2019m glad that I finally got announced as a McLaren driver for next year and we are now looking forward to the future ahead,\u201d Piastri told me in his first interview since the news. \u201cI\u2019m still reserve with Alpine and I\u2019m happy to carry out those duties still, but it\u2019s a discussion that we need to have between myself and the team. We\u2019ll see how that looks and then obviously super excited to be joining the grid with McLaren next season.\u201d\n\nPiastri said he was \u201csuper excited\u201d for the McLaren move\n\nPiastri on... great memories of Alpine but excitement for McLaren future Piastri joined the Alpine Academy in 2020 after winning the Formula Renault Eurocup title the previous year. That season, he won the F3 title at the first attempt and followed in the footsteps of George Russell and Charles Leclerc by winning the F2 title the next year. It was an incredible rise. Over the last couple of years, Piastri has completed a strong testing programme in old F1 machinery, while also embedding himself in the team as reserve driver to prepare himself for when the opportunity arose to make the final step into a race seat. It\u2019s clear that Piastri is grateful to Alpine for the opportunity and support he\u2019s received in developing him. READ MORE: McLaren boss Seidl reveals key factors behind Piastri signing \u2013 and says CRB ruling \u2018not really any surprise\u2019 However, it is believed that while Alpine contributed to his pathway through F2 and F3, plus the running in F1 machinery, a big chunk of the financial support he has needed for successful campaigns in F3 and F2 came from family and sponsors. \u201cI\u2019ve really enjoyed my time with Alpine,\u201d he said. \u201cI joined the Academy off the back of winning the Formula Renault championship in 2019 as part of the prize for winning the championship, and enjoyed two incredibly successful years as part of the Academy with two further championships so I have nothing but respect for all the team at Enstone. \u201cIt was a good testing programme that we came up with with Alpine this year, in place of not having a seat for this year. It\u2019s put me in good stead and I\u2019m very thankful for Alpine for the testing we have done this year, but McLaren is a different team, a different car and the 2022 cars in general are quite different beasts so we\u2019ll see how much of that carries over. \u201cI will look back on my time at Enstone with great memories but I\u2019m now focusing on my future and starting my F1 career.\u201d\n\nPiastri took part in the end-of-season Abu Dhabi test with Alpine last year\n\nPiastri on\u2026 why he left Alpine Alpine had offered Fernando Alonso a new deal, believed to be an additional year with an option for a second. Had the double world champion taken the offer, it would have meant Piastri would not drive an Alpine in 2023 or maybe not even in 2024. That would be three years without a seat in F1. So Piastri started to look elsewhere. In his and his management\u2019s view, they didn\u2019t have a contract to race for Alpine in 2023 and thus they needed to look elsewhere to secure a seat on the grid for that season. ANALYSIS: Unpacking the Piastri-Alpine-McLaren situation after the CRB's ruling \u201cThe CRB ruling has confirmed I didn\u2019t have a contract for the 2023 season [with Alpine],\u201d he said. \u201cI was free to choose my destiny \u2013 and I felt McLaren was a great opportunity. They were very straightforward and very keen and enthusiastic to have me. To be completely honest, there was a lack of clarity around my future at the team at Alpine. \u201cThey publicly stated they wished to continue with Fernando for at least one or two more years. I respect that. But after spending the year out, my hopes were firmly set on an Alpine seat and the lack of clarity and, similarly to Fernando, a bit of a strange feeling in negotiations, it didn\u2019t feel like it was the right decision for me [to stay around]. \u201cThe lack of clarity around my future, and ultimately a breakdown in trust, I felt the very attractive offer of McLaren and the positive dealings with them thus far were all reasons why I felt McLaren was where I was best off for the future.\u201d\n\nPiastri won back-to-back F3 and F2 titles\n\nPiastri on\u2026 the simulator story and that tweet Alpine were surprised when Alonso told them he was leaving for Aston Martin in 2023, but moved swiftly to announce Piastri would drive for them. However, the press release intriguingly didn\u2019t feature a quote from Piastri... It has since emerged that prior to that announcement, Piastri and his management team had told Alpine on two previous occasions that he would not be driving for them next year, which is why Piastri was so disappointed with the way it was handled. \u201cMy decision was made well in advance [of Alonso\u2019s departure], which made Alpine\u2019s announcement probably even more confusing and upsetting because we had told the team that I wasn\u2019t going to continue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was quite upsetting as the announcement was false and it also denied me the opportunity to properly say goodbye to everyone at Enstone. WATCH: Wins, overtakes, and two titles in a row \u2013 The best moments from Oscar Piastri's career so far \u201cI had been with team for a bit over two and a half years now, and for the rest of the team to find out I was leaving in that manner was very upsetting. I still haven\u2019t had the opportunity to say goodbye and it\u2019s something I want to do to show my gratitude to all the men and women at Enstone.\u201d Alpine boss Otmar Szafnauer has previously said he went to speak to Piastri while he was in the simulator to tell him the announcement was being made. He said Piastri \u201csmiled and was thankful\u201d.\n\nThis feature is currently not available because you need to provide consent to functional cookies. Please update your cookie preferences This tweet has been removed from Twitter\n\nWhen asked to recall his memory of the meeting, Piastri said: \u201cThat was a bizarre and frankly upsetting episode. It was done publicly in front of some members of the team who were oblivious to the situation and I didn\u2019t want to cause a scene in front of them. Once we were in private, I told Otmar what our position was and what he had been told multiple times before that. It was very surprising to me to make that announcement.\u201d Soon after the release went out, Piastri responded on Twitter. \"I understand that, without my agreement, Alpine F1 have put out a press release late this afternoon that I am driving for them next year. This is wrong and I have not signed a contract with Alpine for 2023. I will not be driving for Alpine next year.\" It was an unequivocal statement of his position. Piastri explained he felt he had to respond because the release \u201cwas false\u201d. He added: \u201cIt was the biggest moment of my career and probably my life up to now. To have that falsely announced was something my management and I felt we had to correct and there was also potential legal implications if we didn\u2019t deny the announcement. It was not intended to be pointed or in any way anything more than factual. The last line was quite a strong one, but with the CRB ruling, it shows it was purely a fact.\u201d\n\nPiastri was looking forward to measuring himself against Lando Norris in 2023\n\nPiastri on\u2026 the attractiveness of the McLaren project On Friday, ahead of second practice for the Dutch Grand Prix, the CRB revealed their decision, which subsequently allowed McLaren to announce Piastri would join the team on a multi-year deal, starting in 2023. Racing alongside Lando Norris, competing in his fourth season with the team, McLaren will have one of the youngest but most exciting line-ups on the Formula 1 grid. It\u2019s been a more challenging season this time around, the Woking-based outfit sitting fifth in the constructors\u2019 championship and facing an uphill battle to beat Alpine to retain fourth in the standings for a second successive year. But with the team investing heavily in their infrastructure \u2013 including a new wind tunnel that is set to be completed by the end of the season \u2013 McLaren are continuing to lay the building blocks for a sustained period of success. READ MORE: Alonso says \u2018strange feeling\u2019 of protracted Alpine negotiations contributed to shock Aston switch \u201cTheir enthusiasm to have me was very attractive,\u201d said Piastri. \u201cZak [Brown] and Andreas [Seidl] were very straightforward and to the point. \u201cMcLaren have a competitive car. Obviously it\u2019s a tight battle between Alpine and McLaren right now, but they are a competitive team with a hell of a lot of winning history, and I think the environment is a great fit for me. \u201cThe team has great plans and the future is exciting. I\u2019m also looking forward to working and driving alongside Lando. I know it\u2019s going to be a challenge, but I feel McLaren is the right place for me to start life in F1. I\u2019m super excited to get started.\u201d\n\nPiastri said it was unfortunate that of all the people on the grid, it was Ricciardo who he would replace",

After steadily rising up the F1 constructors\u2019 standings over the last couple of years, the next target is clear: break into the \u2018top three\u2019 and edge towards title contention. In the latest episode of our Beyond The Grid podcast, the French brand\u2019s CEO tells us how he plans to make it happen\u2026 Rossi took on the overarching role at Alpine ahead of the 2021 season \u2013 following parent company Renault\u2019s decision to rebrand their team \u2013 with the task of turning the midfield runners into regular podium finishers, race winners and, ultimately, world champions. READ MORE: \u2018It\u2019s time to get to work\u2019 \u2013 Pierre Gasly takes you behind the scenes in his exclusive new F1.com column Central to these ambitions is the timeline introduced by Rossi and outlined towards the end of Alpine\u2019s first season. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be every year a bit better. It\u2019s a 100-race project, four years, four seasons,\u201d he made clear. So far, that 100-race project is on track. Alpine held on to fifth in 2021, which included a standout win for Esteban Ocon at the wet-dry Hungarian Grand Prix, before progressing to fourth in 2022, via a scrap with McLaren.\n\nLaurent Rossi is entering his third season as CEO of Alpine\n\nHeading into 2023, and the second year of F1\u2019s recent rules reset, Rossi knows exactly what Alpine should be targeting next, while being well aware of the challenge ahead, as he settles into a lengthy conversation for Beyond The Grid. \u201cTwo years ago, I said \u2013 and everybody was like \u2018Ah, they\u2019re still buying time \u2013 we\u2019re on a 100-race journey. I maintain that,\u201d Rossi explains to host Tom Clarkson, fielding questions over Alpine\u2019s ambitions. READ MORE: \u2018Everything went wrong today\u2019 says frustrated Ocon after being penalised three times and retiring early in Bahrain \u201cIt takes time to turn around a ship like that, to basically get to where Mercedes is \u2013 was, in fact \u2013 Red Bull is. All these teams have taken a good three, four, five years for some \u2013 Ferrari even longer \u2013 to get back to podiums. \u201cWe\u2019re on this path, hopefully. The first two years of that kind of four, five-year plan are going well \u2013 they delivered according to our expectations. We finished fifth in 2021, fourth in 2022, so it\u2019s only natural now we are looking towards the other spots up there on the 'podium'.",

They offered him a term of two years, the second season being an option, with the idea that once that ended, he would continue with Alpine in other motorsport categories.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.exclusive-piastri-on-joining-mclaren-leaving-alpine-and-making-his-f1-debut.5QCf7hwpoP2DwexQzKkVy7.html\">EXCLUSIVE: Piastri on joining McLaren, leaving Alpine and making his F1 debut</a></strong></p>\n<p>They would then draft Piastri into a race seat from 2025, having loaned him out to Williams for a couple of seasons to gather some experience. Rossi says they couldn&#8217;t offer Alonso a longer contract because they would risk losing Piastri. The Spaniard decided that wasn&#8217;t enough and agreed to join Aston Martin next season on a multi-year deal.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We wanted him to continue with us as an endurance and/or Dakar driver,&#8221; Rossi tells me on Saturday, ahead of Italian Grand Prix qualifying. &#8220;We spoke about it at length last year. Why did we only offer him two years? We only had two years of option with Oscar. Fernando had a desire to drive longer in F1, which we couldn&#8217;t match or we would have lost Oscar. It didn&#8217;t make sense for us. More than likely, we couldn&#8217;t match other conditions that were offered, too.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So, with Fernando, we would have loved to continue. He&#8217;s an amazing champion, he will remain a legend of our brand &#8211; but it didn&#8217;t work and that&#8217;s life. We will stay on good terms. He&#8217;s an exceptional champion, he&#8217;s a gentleman, he&#8217;s continuing to do fantastic work for us despite having signed [for Aston Martin for next year]. We&#8217;re sad to part ways but we remain family. That&#8217;s life. It&#8217;s a blow to lose a champion, but it happens. Silly seasons, they move like that.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oscar was not expected,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;Frankly, it&#8217;s disappointing.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"MONZA, ITALY - SEPTEMBER 08: Fernando Alonso of Spain and Alpine F1 talks in the drivers press\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        Alonso will be making his way to Aston Martin for the 2023 season\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <h3>Rossi on&#8230; the commitment and offer made to Piastri</h3>\n<p>Soon after Alonso&#8217;s news broke on the Monday following the Hungarian Grand Prix, Alpine moved to announce Piastri would drive for them in 2023. However, Piastri responded on Twitter that he would &#8220;not be driving for Alpine next year&#8221;.  To understand Alpine&#8217;s view on why they were surprised by Piastri&#8217;s position, we must head back to November the previous year.</p>\n<p>Rossi says that Alpine had made a commitment, outlined in a Head of Terms document, to train Piastri extensively &#8220;and then send him to drive with another team&#8221; while they ran Alonso for at least one &#8211; possibly two seasons &#8211; before bringing him back.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We did deliver on our commitment to Oscar very quickly, as we exercised our option on November 15, agreeing on Head of Terms which said he would be reserve. He would receive an extensive training programme, among other things 5,000km of driving through the year, and we&#8217;re going to find him a driving seat for &#8216;23 and &#8217;24,&#8221; says Rossi.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.timeline-how-the-oscar-piastri-saga-unfolded.3SgAcTkt9El6qM1W7p6HzW.html\">TIMELINE: How the Oscar Piastri saga unfolded</a></strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We did just that. We announced him as a reserve the day after. We very quickly devised a training programme and a 5,000km testing programme, which started in February alongside Fernando Alonso and Esteban Ocon &#8211; that&#8217;s a serious training programme. You&#8217;re driving with two F1 drivers, you will learn from them.</p>\n<p>&#8220;He drove 3,700km by August. We would have easily obtained the 5,000km. We gave him full access to the team, debriefs, technical meetings and he was with me most Sundays listening to the race. Not only was he a reserve, but he would have been the most trained rookie ever. He knew how the team operated, how an F1 driver is supposed to operate in the team. We feel like we delivered. We went above and beyond.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We hired a person just to find him a seat [with another team], because we wanted to do that properly. By the end of April, we found him a seat at Williams.&#8221;</p>\n\n    \n            \n    <p>This feature is currently not available because you need to provide consent to functional cookies.

Alpine then became aware that McLaren had made him an offer, the details of which were unclear to Rossi at the time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When the Williams opportunity was about to turn into a concrete deal, so much so that the seat fitting was scheduled, they [Piastri&#8217;s management team] said &#8216;we have a possible opportunity at McLaren,&#8217;&#8221; says Rossi. &#8220;It was a bit disappointing. We felt it was a bit strange, because we expected a bit more loyalty considering how much we put in there. He didn&#8217;t say he was going to go, he said he had an opportunity.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.reaction-what-the-piastri-contract-tussle-means-for-him-alpine-mclaren-and.2dtmheLb1TfziflNihdKKS.html\">REACTION: What the Piastri contract tussle means for him, Alpine, McLaren &#8211; and the rest of the driver market</a></strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Then we saw in July, the sixth I think, that [Daniel] Ricciardo was confirming for the year after [this is two days after, it later emerged, Piastri had signed with McLaren]. So we thought there is interest, but there might not even be a seat. There was perhaps an opportunity [at McLaren, but] the door is closing, so Oscar is still in play for us. It explains why we decided to promote him &#8211; he was reserve and we elevated in the same framework to race driver.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Otmar [Szafnauer, Alpine Team Principal] saw him, told him, and we announced it. We never knew for a fact he had signed. He never told us. We still believed the Williams seat was a great one, a great opportunity to learn without a bit less pressure &#8211; a very good team to learn in, very seasoned, capable of growing talents like George [Russell, who spent three years at the team as something of an apprenticeship before being recalled to Mercedes].</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"Bemused\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        Rather than stepping up to F1 with Alpine, Piastri will make his debut at rival team McLaren\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <p>&#8220;But we could understand he was attracted by the prospect of a better challenge sporting-wise. We felt when we had the chance to offer him a better seat, I would contend, with us because we are a works team, we felt like we would offer it to him and he would accept it as there was no better option &#8211; Ricciardo was staying.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We acted very logically, in line with our commitment to him. From our perspective, it&#8217;s a very linear, simple story. We have been so committed. I don&#8217;t think we could have given more to any driver, to be honest.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Rossi on&#8230; mistakes that were made</h3>\n<p>Last weekend, the Contract Recognition Board (CRB) determined that the only valid contract Piastri had was with McLaren, not with Alpine, paving the way for the Australian to join up with Lando Norris next season.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it came down to the fact Piastri never signed legal paperwork locking him into Alpine. &#8220;He never signed any contracts we put to him,&#8221; says Rossi. &#8220;We put contracts forward many times. They were never signed. We could not retain him because he didn&#8217;t sign a contract with us. We were expecting more loyalty.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rossi admits that mistakes were made by his team &#8211; and that, to some extent, Alpine showed some naivety in the way they dealt with the situation. However, he believes they acted in good faith throughout.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/video.otmar-szafnauer-gives-his-reaction-to-the-oscar-piastri-contract-decision-after-the-crb-rules-against-alpine.1742941825029492274.html\">WATCH: Otmar Szafnauer gives his reaction to the Oscar Piastri contract decision after the CRB rules against Alpine</a></strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We made some mistakes, we made some legal technical mistakes,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We left the door ajar by not forcing him in with a contract that is so tight he couldn&#8217;t move. Why did we do that? It&#8217;s a bit of an oversight because we never thought that when you give so much to someone, when you give them training, a reserve role, a seat in a partner team, he will not take it after being supported for so many years and winning the championship through your support.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Like George [Russell] before him, who went to Williams before returning to Mercedes, like Charles [Leclerc] who went to Sauber before returning to Ferrari, like Max [Verstappen] and like Sebastian [Vettel, who both raced for Toro Rosso before driving for Red Bull] &#8211; they all did a &#8216;junior&#8217; team before moving up.</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"BUDAPEST, HUNGARY - JULY 30: Pole position qualifier George Russell of Great Britain and Mercedes\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        Leclerc and Russell debuted with Alfa Romeo/Sauber and Williams respectively before receiving promotions from Ferrari and Mercedes\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a bit surprised that Oscar thought that first, he was better than Williams. I can understand from a sporting perspective McLaren might be more interesting based on pure on-track results than Williams, but we didn&#8217;t expect that after so much support, so much loyalty, they would use that back door to shop around and get what felt like a better contract for them. Those are not the values we exhibited.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is how I see the story. Of course, we made mistakes, otherwise we wouldn&#8217;t be here talking about the topic, but we feel we stayed very true to our commitment, to our values and to our words to Oscar.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But I would say things happen for a reason. We&#8217;re not sharing the same conceptions of things, and perhaps not sharing the same values, so it&#8217;s perhaps better this way, to be parting ways.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Rossi on&#8230; the Alpine management</h3>\n<p>Team Principal Otmar Szafnauer joined the squad during this saga, allowing Rossi to take a step back from the day-to-day running of the F1 team so he can focus on running the wider Alpine business, which continues to show growth in road car sales &#8211; the finance of which can then be ploughed back into the F1 team.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.alpine-boss-szafnauer-responds-to-crb-ruling-and-piastris-bizarre-and.ZXLvO8h9mqbUwzwVdsU3H.html\">READ MORE: Alpine boss Szafnauer responds to CRB ruling and Piastri's 'bizarre and upsetting' comments</a></strong></p>\n<p>Despite the frustration of losing two highly-rated drivers, Rossi has thrown his full support behind Szafnauer, who he feels has made strong changes since joining the outfit from Aston Martin in February.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The roles are very clear,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Otmar is the F1 boss. I have full confidence in him. I tag-team with him a lot. In the transition from me to him upon arrival, it&#8217;s been remarkable &#8211; he&#8217;s made a difference since he arrived. He&#8217;s continuing to make a difference. He&#8217;s been hired to help me take a bit of a distance, as I have 16 direct reports.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I need to build cars, expand the Alpine network, build a brand. I spent a disproportionate amount of time last year on F1. I will spend less and less time as now I have a very capable leader at helm in Otmar. The roles are very set. I will lead the Alpine brand, which is more than an F1 team. Luca [De Meo] leads the Renault Group and its transformation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t change, it works well. We made mistakes.

It&#8217;s why they put so much into his preparation. With so little testing in Formula 1 these days, any car time is useful.</p>\n<p>Of all the junior academies, Alpine has one of the most &#8211; if not the most &#8211; extensive programme, giving their drivers plenty of track time. In the last decade, aside from Lance Stroll, few can call on more than 3,000km of testing in F1 machinery.</p>\n<p>Piastri, of course, had to do what is best for him &#8211; and he felt that McLaren offered him that chance. He remains grateful to Alpine for everything they have done. However, Alpine feel hurt that he left. And now they face the prospect of watching a driver they trained up excel at a rival. It is for that reason they are questioning the future of their academy.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.alonso-says-strange-feeling-of-protracted-alpine-negotiations-contributed-to.4csIj0fzNLEwlPyBhfvInN.html\">READ MORE: Alonso says &#8216;strange feeling&#8217; of protracted Alpine negotiations contributed to shock Aston switch</a></strong></p>\n<p>It comes after Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said that, while he believes &#8220;in the integrity of the drivers&#8221; they have in their junior stable, the team will be &#8220;employing even more lawyers for even stricter contracts&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s setting a dangerous precedent,&#8221; says Rossi. &#8220;It&#8217;s creating a possible framework where driver academies are at risk. Manufacturers invest a lot in budding talents.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The first remedy, which is what Toto mentioned, is to look at contracts differently &#8211; we will be much tougher. We learn form that, to take less of a naive perspective on shaking hands and being partners on more legally binding terms, which will be a bit less friendly.</p>\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            <img alt=\"Piastri\" class=\"lazy\">\n        \n    \n    \n\n        Piastri won the 2021 F2 title with Alpine's backing\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    <p>&#8220;Then there is the even bigger consideration &#8211; is it worth it, us investing so much in detecting and supporting talent?

If we are not sure we can, and it becomes too complicated or too big a burden on the contract side &#8211; as contracts can only take you so far &#8211; you don&#8217;t want to make them so appealing because it binds you so much.

            "text": "Alpine are hurting \u2013 and it\u2019s no surprise to see why. In the space of a few weeks, they lost a double world champion in Fernando Alonso, who they hoped to race on with in 2023 before embarking on a longer relationship beyond F1 into other motorsport series. Then they lost Oscar Piastri, the highly-rated F2 champion whom they had invested in and hoped could be their future. Now the fourth fastest team on the grid \u2013 who are showing themselves as the best-placed to challenge the big teams Mercedes, Red Bull and Ferrari, are without a driver to partner Esteban Ocon next year. But, as CEO Laurent Rossi explains, when speaking exclusively for the first time since the dramatic story reached a crescendo, Alpine are not panicking. Rossi on\u2026 Alpine\u2019s plan for Alonso and Piastri Alpine wanted to continue with Alonso (in his third stint with the Enstone-based team) beyond the end of this season, when his contract expired. They offered him a term of two years, the second season being an option, with the idea that once that ended, he would continue with Alpine in other motorsport categories. EXCLUSIVE: Piastri on joining McLaren, leaving Alpine and making his F1 debut They would then draft Piastri into a race seat from 2025, having loaned him out to Williams for a couple of seasons to gather some experience. Rossi says they couldn\u2019t offer Alonso a longer contract because they would risk losing Piastri. The Spaniard decided that wasn\u2019t enough and agreed to join Aston Martin next season on a multi-year deal. \u201cWe wanted him to continue with us as an endurance and/or Dakar driver,\u201d Rossi tells me on Saturday, ahead of Italian Grand Prix qualifying. \u201cWe spoke about it at length last year. Why did we only offer him two years? We only had two years of option with Oscar. Fernando had a desire to drive longer in F1, which we couldn\u2019t match or we would have lost Oscar. It didn\u2019t make sense for us. More than likely, we couldn\u2019t match other conditions that were offered, too. \u201cSo, with Fernando, we would have loved to continue. He\u2019s an amazing champion, he will remain a legend of our brand \u2013 but it didn\u2019t work and that\u2019s life. We will stay on good terms. He\u2019s an exceptional champion, he\u2019s a gentleman, he\u2019s continuing to do fantastic work for us despite having signed [for Aston Martin for next year]. We\u2019re sad to part ways but we remain family. That\u2019s life. It\u2019s a blow to lose a champion, but it happens. Silly seasons, they move like that. \u201cOscar was not expected,\u201d he adds. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s disappointing.\u201d\n\nAlonso will be making his way to Aston Martin for the 2023 season\n\nRossi on\u2026 the commitment and offer made to Piastri Soon after Alonso\u2019s news broke on the Monday following the Hungarian Grand Prix, Alpine moved to announce Piastri would drive for them in 2023. However, Piastri responded on Twitter that he would \u201cnot be driving for Alpine next year\u201d. To understand Alpine\u2019s view on why they were surprised by Piastri\u2019s position, we must head back to November the previous year. Rossi says that Alpine had made a commitment, outlined in a Head of Terms document, to train Piastri extensively \u201cand then send him to drive with another team\u201d while they ran Alonso for at least one \u2013 possibly two seasons \u2013 before bringing him back. \u201cWe did deliver on our commitment to Oscar very quickly, as we exercised our option on November 15, agreeing on Head of Terms which said he would be reserve. He would receive an extensive training programme, among other things 5,000km of driving through the year, and we\u2019re going to find him a driving seat for \u201823 and \u201924,\u201d says Rossi. TIMELINE: How the Oscar Piastri saga unfolded \u201cWe did just that. We announced him as a reserve the day after. We very quickly devised a training programme and a 5,000km testing programme, which started in February alongside Fernando Alonso and Esteban Ocon \u2013 that\u2019s a serious training programme. You\u2019re driving with two F1 drivers, you will learn from them. \u201cHe drove 3,700km by August. We would have easily obtained the 5,000km. We gave him full access to the team, debriefs, technical meetings and he was with me most Sundays listening to the race. Not only was he a reserve, but he would have been the most trained rookie ever. He knew how the team operated, how an F1 driver is supposed to operate in the team. We feel like we delivered. We went above and beyond. \u201cWe hired a person just to find him a seat [with another team], because we wanted to do that properly. By the end of April, we found him a seat at Williams.\u201d\n\nThis feature is currently not available because you need to provide consent to functional cookies.

Alpine then became aware that McLaren had made him an offer, the details of which were unclear to Rossi at the time. \u201cWhen the Williams opportunity was about to turn into a concrete deal, so much so that the seat fitting was scheduled, they [Piastri\u2019s management team] said \u2018we have a possible opportunity at McLaren,\u2019\u201d says Rossi. \u201cIt was a bit disappointing. We felt it was a bit strange, because we expected a bit more loyalty considering how much we put in there. He didn\u2019t say he was going to go, he said he had an opportunity. REACTION: What the Piastri contract tussle means for him, Alpine, McLaren \u2013 and the rest of the driver market \u201cThen we saw in July, the sixth I think, that [Daniel] Ricciardo was confirming for the year after [this is two days after, it later emerged, Piastri had signed with McLaren]. So we thought there is interest, but there might not even be a seat. There was perhaps an opportunity [at McLaren, but] the door is closing, so Oscar is still in play for us. It explains why we decided to promote him \u2013 he was reserve and we elevated in the same framework to race driver. \u201cOtmar [Szafnauer, Alpine Team Principal] saw him, told him, and we announced it. We never knew for a fact he had signed. He never told us. We still believed the Williams seat was a great one, a great opportunity to learn without a bit less pressure \u2013 a very good team to learn in, very seasoned, capable of growing talents like George [Russell, who spent three years at the team as something of an apprenticeship before being recalled to Mercedes].\n\nRather than stepping up to F1 with Alpine, Piastri will make his debut at rival team McLaren\n\n\u201cBut we could understand he was attracted by the prospect of a better challenge sporting-wise. We felt when we had the chance to offer him a better seat, I would contend, with us because we are a works team, we felt like we would offer it to him and he would accept it as there was no better option \u2013 Ricciardo was staying. \u201cWe acted very logically, in line with our commitment to him. From our perspective, it\u2019s a very linear, simple story. We have been so committed. I don\u2019t think we could have given more to any driver, to be honest.\u201d Rossi on\u2026 mistakes that were made Last weekend, the Contract Recognition Board (CRB) determined that the only valid contract Piastri had was with McLaren, not with Alpine, paving the way for the Australian to join up with Lando Norris next season. Ultimately, it came down to the fact Piastri never signed legal paperwork locking him into Alpine. \u201cHe never signed any contracts we put to him,\u201d says Rossi. \u201cWe put contracts forward many times. They were never signed. We could not retain him because he didn\u2019t sign a contract with us. We were expecting more loyalty.\u201d Rossi admits that mistakes were made by his team \u2013 and that, to some extent, Alpine showed some naivety in the way they dealt with the situation. However, he believes they acted in good faith throughout. WATCH: Otmar Szafnauer gives his reaction to the Oscar Piastri contract decision after the CRB rules against Alpine \u201cWe made some mistakes, we made some legal technical mistakes,\u201d he says. \u201cWe left the door ajar by not forcing him in with a contract that is so tight he couldn\u2019t move. Why did we do that? It\u2019s a bit of an oversight because we never thought that when you give so much to someone, when you give them training, a reserve role, a seat in a partner team, he will not take it after being supported for so many years and winning the championship through your support. \u201cLike George [Russell] before him, who went to Williams before returning to Mercedes, like Charles [Leclerc] who went to Sauber before returning to Ferrari, like Max [Verstappen] and like Sebastian [Vettel, who both raced for Toro Rosso before driving for Red Bull] \u2013 they all did a \u2018junior\u2019 team before moving up.\n\nLeclerc and Russell debuted with Alfa Romeo/Sauber and Williams respectively before receiving promotions from Ferrari and Mercedes\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a bit surprised that Oscar thought that first, he was better than Williams. I can understand from a sporting perspective McLaren might be more interesting based on pure on-track results than Williams, but we didn\u2019t expect that after so much support, so much loyalty, they would use that back door to shop around and get what felt like a better contract for them. Those are not the values we exhibited. \u201cThis is how I see the story. Of course, we made mistakes, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be here talking about the topic, but we feel we stayed very true to our commitment, to our values and to our words to Oscar. \u201cBut I would say things happen for a reason. We\u2019re not sharing the same conceptions of things, and perhaps not sharing the same values, so it\u2019s perhaps better this way, to be parting ways.\u201d Rossi on\u2026 the Alpine management Team Principal Otmar Szafnauer joined the squad during this saga, allowing Rossi to take a step back from the day-to-day running of the F1 team so he can focus on running the wider Alpine business, which continues to show growth in road car sales \u2013 the finance of which can then be ploughed back into the F1 team. READ MORE: Alpine boss Szafnauer responds to CRB ruling and Piastri's 'bizarre and upsetting' comments Despite the frustration of losing two highly-rated drivers, Rossi has thrown his full support behind Szafnauer, who he feels has made strong changes since joining the outfit from Aston Martin in February. \u201cThe roles are very clear,\u201d he says. \u201cOtmar is the F1 boss. I have full confidence in him. I tag-team with him a lot. In the transition from me to him upon arrival, it\u2019s been remarkable \u2013 he\u2019s made a difference since he arrived. He\u2019s continuing to make a difference. He\u2019s been hired to help me take a bit of a distance, as I have 16 direct reports. \u201cI need to build cars, expand the Alpine network, build a brand. I spent a disproportionate amount of time last year on F1. I will spend less and less time as now I have a very capable leader at helm in Otmar. The roles are very set. I will lead the Alpine brand, which is more than an F1 team. Luca [De Meo] leads the Renault Group and its transformation. \u201cIt won\u2019t change, it works well. We made mistakes. We will clearly learn our lessons.\n\nThis feature is currently not available because you need to provide consent to functional cookies. Please update your cookie preferences Oscar Piastri's best moments so far\n\nRossi on\u2026 the Alpine Academy Alpine brought Piastri through their academy in the hope that he would race for the Formula 1 team. It\u2019s why they put so much into his preparation. With so little testing in Formula 1 these days, any car time is useful. Of all the junior academies, Alpine has one of the most \u2013 if not the most \u2013 extensive programme, giving their drivers plenty of track time. In the last decade, aside from Lance Stroll, few can call on more than 3,000km of testing in F1 machinery. Piastri, of course, had to do what is best for him \u2013 and he felt that McLaren offered him that chance. He remains grateful to Alpine for everything they have done. However, Alpine feel hurt that he left. And now they face the prospect of watching a driver they trained up excel at a rival. It is for that reason they are questioning the future of their academy. READ MORE: Alonso says \u2018strange feeling\u2019 of protracted Alpine negotiations contributed to shock Aston switch It comes after Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said that, while he believes \u201cin the integrity of the drivers\u201d they have in their junior stable, the team will be \u201cemploying even more lawyers for even stricter contracts\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s setting a dangerous precedent,\u201d says Rossi. \u201cIt\u2019s creating a possible framework where driver academies are at risk. Manufacturers invest a lot in budding talents. \u201cThe first remedy, which is what Toto mentioned, is to look at contracts differently \u2013 we will be much tougher. We learn form that, to take less of a naive perspective on shaking hands and being partners on more legally binding terms, which will be a bit less friendly.\n\nPiastri won the 2021 F2 title with Alpine's backing\n\n\u201cThen there is the even bigger consideration \u2013 is it worth it, us investing so much in detecting and supporting talent? If someone who doesn\u2019t do that kind of stuff, saves that money and then poaches them when they are fully trained \u2013 why don\u2019t we do the same? It\u2019s a tough question \u2013 as it\u2019s about what you believe in. \u201cWe believe in bringing youth through; it\u2019s anchored in the Renault Group. It\u2019s our values, giving a chance to young drivers. Values are important. You want to stand for something. READ MORE: F1 \u2018the only racing I\u2019m interested in at this stage of my career\u2019 says Ricciardo, as he fails to rule out 2023 sabbatical \u201cWe will honour our commitment to all drivers in our academy, but we\u2019re wondering whether or not to continue. We are torn apart. We believe in the value of the system but if we\u2019re not protected, is it worth it? If we are not sure we can, and it becomes too complicated or too big a burden on the contract side \u2013 as contracts can only take you so far \u2013 you don\u2019t want to make them so appealing because it binds you so much. We really wonder. It\u2019s a big disappointment. Perhaps a big reality check.\u201d Rossi on\u2026 the second seat Attention is now on securing a team mate for Esteban Ocon for 2023, with Alpine in no rush to decide. As the fourth-best team on the grid, they are an attractive prospect. Their car development this year, with updates brought to every race and delivering performance each time, has been impressive.\n\nThe identity of Ocon's team mate for 2023 has yet to be confirmed\n\nRossi set a 100-race target (roughly four seasons) of being competitive and regularly contending for podiums by making consistent progress \u2013 and to be fair them, they\u2019re doing just that in the first season of four. \u201cThere will be bumps on the road. I\u2019m not a fool \u2013 I know we are going to have bad times,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Idea is to continue the progression. We\u2019re the fourth force of the grid, and our seat is in high demand. That\u2019s good. We will take our time. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to rush into the decision. It\u2019s a process Otmar is leading, as he knows what is best for the team. We take input from our engineers. The driver is important, but the car is the most important by far.\u201d READ MORE: Ricciardo \u2018assessing everything\u2019 for the future as Hamilton says he\u2019s \u2018far too talented\u2019 to not be racing A flurry of names have been linked with the seat, including AlphaTauri\u2019s Pierre Gasly and F2 racer Jack Doohan, who is part of the Alpine Academy. Alpine will spend the next few weeks mulling whether to take experience, to find a driver for one-year only, to leave them options in 2024 when more drivers will be available \u2013 or to go for youth and invest in the future. \u201cWe need someone who helps develop the team, who helps develop the car,\u201d says Rossi. \u201cWe need a seasoned enough, effective enough driver who will score points right away and also take the team up with him. These are criteria we are looking at.\n\nGasly's name has been heavily linked with Alpine in recent weeks",

One scenario is he stays with Alpine and the French team will have one of the most exciting drivers to have come out of junior formulae since Lando Norris, George Russell and Alex Albon were promoted \u2013 but they will have to repair a relationship that has started off on a sour note. Another scenario is not to continue together. Alpine will need to revert to their shortlist of potential drivers while Piastri pursues an alternative pathway, which is believed to be with McLaren, with the exact role to be determined.\n\nCould Ricciardo's seat be up for grabs?",

Not wearing the full suit yet, I\u2019m still running with the unbranded one but to be out on track with the Alpine and kick off\u2026 in my mind I am already starting the 2023 season, already working for next year. It was definitely very special.\u201d",

It all makes sense for me, so I'm very excited for what's coming.\"\n\nPierre Gasly, Alpine A522 Photo by: Mark Sutton / Motorsport Images\n\nAsked if the test confirmed his thoughts about the potential Alpine has, Gasly replied: \"I think it's been even better.\n\n\"So far from what I've seen, there is massive experience in this team, from the engineers inside the engineering office but also inside the garage.\n\n\"I haven't seen everything yet, I still need to go to Enstone and see all the tools and facilities they have. But I've been very impressed with their way of approaching this first day.\"\n\nGasly was also impressed by the welcome he received from Alpine, particularly given how close the test was to the find of the season.\n\n\"It's never easy when you've got someone new coming in,\" he said. \"We were still racing [against each other] two days ago with our respective teams and drivers so it goes pretty quick.\n\n\"But they've been very welcoming in the best possible way, and so far [there are] only positive signs.\n\n\"So it's really promising for the future.\"\n\nGasly will get only one-and-a-half days in pre-season testing to adjust to its 2023 car ahead of the opening race in Bahrain as he splits duties with new teammate Esteban Ocon, making the Abu Dhabi running a useful way to get a first read of its processes.\n\nThe Frenchman is set to formally link up with his new team in January once his final duties for AlphaTauri are complete, which included a recent appearance at the Honda Thanks Day in Japan.\n\n\"I'm in the transition phase,\" Gasly said.\n\n\"Obviously sporting-wise, I'm fully focused for next year with Alpine. I still have a couple of commitments to do with AlphaTauri but yeah, I'll start working with the guys for next season.\"",

After the last two seasons featured three sprint races, F1 has increased that number to six for 2023.</p><p>Sprint weekends offer more competitive on-track action, with qualifying held on Friday setting a grid for a shortened race on Saturday that sets the grid for Sunday's grand prix.</p><p>The venues for the sprint races this year are Azerbaijan, Austria, Belgium, Qatar, United States and Brazil.</p><h2>What else is new?</h2><p>There have been a number of driver switches over the winter as well as some high-profile management changes.</p><p><b>Alonso to Aston Martin</b></p><p>After making his return to F1 with Alpine two seasons ago, two-time champion Fernando Alonso decided to switch things up for 2023 and move to Aston Martin. The news, which was announced the day after last year's Hungarian Grand Prix, caught Alpine by surprise and set in motion a number of other changes up and down the grid. Alonso joins Aston Martin ahead of the team's move to its new factory in May, which it hopes will help close the gap the to the front of the grid.</p><p><b>Ricciardo becomes Red Bull's third driver</b></p><p>Once all of the drama of F1's driver market had played out, Daniel Ricciardo was the biggest name without a seat on the grid for 2023. After starting the 2022 season in the second year of a seemingly air-tight three-year contract with McLaren, poor results and the emergence of Oscar Piastri as a potential replacement saw him agree to an early termination of the deal at the end of the year. Options elsewhere were slim and he opted not to explore the possibility of a move to Haas, instead returning to his old team Red Bull where he will take on marketing and test driver responsibilities. He hopes to return to the grid in 2024, although it is not yet clear where he will slot in.</p><p><b>Oscar Piastri joins McLaren</b></p><p>Piastri has long been recognised as the most exciting young driver outside F1, and it was always a matter of time until he joined the grid. As an Alpine junior the main blockage in his career progression had been the team's two race drivers, Alonso and Esteban Ocon, who appeared to be committed to Alpine until Alonso announced his plans to move to Aston Martin in the summer. By that time, however, Piastri and his manager Mark Webber were already fed up of waiting on a more permanent deal and had signed with McLaren for Piastri to replace Ricciardo. Expectations are set high after such a turbulent entry into F1, but Piastri's record suggests he has the talent to meet and exceed them.</p><p><b>An American on the grid</b></p><p>F1's seven-year wait for an American driver is finally over with Logan Sargeant joining Williams this year. Initially it looked like Colton Herta would be America's breakthrough star but his performance in IndyCar meant he wasn't eligible for a superlicence, which blocked a move to AlphaTauri. Meanwhile, Sargeant, who finished fourth in Formula 2 last year, was impressing Williams in his development driver role and was announced as Nicholas Latifi's replacement and Alex Albon's teammate for 2023.</p><p><b>Gasly to Alpine and de Vries to AlphaTauri</b></p><p>Pierre Gasly emerged as Alpine's top pick to replace Alonso once it lost Piastri to McLaren, but the Frenchman had a contract to race for AlphaTauri in 2023. However, a well-timed super-sub performance by Dutchman Nyck de Vries at Williams -- standing in for Albon in Italy when the Thai driver had appendicitis -- convinced AlphaTauri to release Gasly and sign up the former Formula E champion. The switch sees Gasly join Esteban Ocon in an all-French lineup at Alpine and de Vries partner Yuki Tsunoda at AlphaTauri.</p><p><strong>The return of the The Hulk</strong></p><p>Haas' patience with Mick Schumacher finally ran out in 2022 as it decided to replace him with the more experienced Nico Hulkenberg. The 35-year-old German raced five times across the 2020 and 2022 seasons as a reserve driver for Racing Point/Aston Martin but has not completed a full season since 2019. Haas hopes the combination of Hulkenberg and Kevin Magnussen will bring consistent results and limit its repair bill, which spiraled in 2022 after Schumacher had two big accidents in Saudi Arabia and Monaco. The son of seven-time world champion Michael will remain in F1 as Mercedes' reserve driver.</p><p><b>Binotto out at Ferrari, Vasseur in</b></p><p class=\"ad-slot ad-slot-incontent2 ad-wrapper\"></p><p>It wasn't just drivers switching teams, a number of key management personnel have also left or moved roles over the winter. The trigger was Mattia Binotto resigning from the top spot at Ferrari after a long-awaited title campaign failed to materialise in 2022. Binotto had denied stories he would leave the team right up to until the final round of the year, but just weeks after the chequered flag fell in Abu Dhabi he was out of the job. Alfa Romeo's Fred Vasseur was lined up to take Binotto's place and had his first day in charge at the start of the second week of January.</p><p>McLaren team principal Andreas Seidl was released from his role shortly after to head up Audi's entry to F1 in 2026, which will see the German brand take over the Sauber team currently running under the Alfa Romeo name. Seidl will be replaced by Andrea Stella at McLaren, who was previously the team's sporting director and is highly-rated by CEO Zak Brown.</p><p>Elsewhere, Jost Capito left Williams along with the team's technical director FX Demaison. No replacement has been announced for either.</p><h3>Rules</h3><p>After the complete overhaul of Formula One's technical regulations for 2022, the changes this season are relatively minor. Tweaks have been made to the regulations around the floor of the cars -- raising the throat of the diffuser in height and introducing more stringent flexibility tests -- to reduce their sensitivity and decrease the propensity for the 'porpoising' seen at the start of last year. The FIA will also continue to monitor the car's oscillations on track and disqualify any car that is bouncing at a rate deemed dangerous to the driver.</p>\n</div>",

The team in orange seemed to struggle with aerodynamic efficiency and further issues sprung up at the front of the car with their front wheel brows needing strengthening, which hampered rookie Oscar Piastri and team mate Lando Norris.</p>\n<p>As a result, McLaren managed just 312 laps over the three days and our data put them in the bottom half. Perhaps they didn't get a representative quali or race run in, but it's not a great start for the Woking team.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.more-points-and-prizes-mini-leagues-and-boosters-how-to-get-the-most-out-of.3bJ8nRae206OCbpJ4qLrAX.html\">READ MORE: More points and prizes, mini leagues and boosters &#8211; How to get the most out of F1 Fantasy in 2023</a></strong></p>\n<h3>6.

            "text": "The 2023 Formula 1 season is almost here with all 20 drivers getting ready for lights out in Bahrain this weekend. We\u2019ve only seen the new cars run for three days as they took to the circuit last week for pre-season testing \u2013 but how do they rank at this early stage? Day 1 of testing saw Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen set the fastest time before Alfa Romeo\u2019s Zhou Guanyu lit up the timesheets on Day 2, and Verstappen\u2019s team mate Sergio Perez capped off the test with the fastest lap of the whole test on Day 3. Our data team have crunched the numbers and \u2013 with the usual caveats that it's hard to be definitive given unknowns like fuel loads and setups \u2013 this is how they reckon the order is looking ahead of the new season... READ MORE: The 5 key questions from 2023 pre-season testing in Bahrain\n\n10. Williams\n\nSmooth sailing for Williams rookie Logan Sargeant and his new team mate in Bahrain\n\nWilliams' only reliability concern over the three days of pre-season testing was a small electrical issue, as rookie Logan Sargeant and team mate Alex Albon notched up an impressive 439 laps of the Bahrain International Circuit, which is as good a return as they could hope for. As for the performance of the FW45, Albon said the car was \"definitely quicker\" than last year's version. Whether we saw the true potential of it last week remains to be seen, and right now they sit at the bottom of the Power Rankings. That doesn't mean they haven't improved; it means there might be more to come from the sleeping giants. WINNERS AND LOSERS: Who aced 2023 F1 pre-season testing and who has work to do ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix? 9. Haas\n\nHaas notched 414 laps over the three days, with the team's fastest tour set by Kevin Magnussen\n\nHaas got some solid running on the board as Kevin Magnussen set the seventh-fastest time of testing on Day 3 and Nico Hulkenberg got his eye in once again. Test driver Pietro Fittipaldi said the team were around P5-P7 in the charts but our data might hint that, at this stage before the opening Grand Prix, they're perhaps not at the level of Alpine and Aston Martin \u2013 but this midfield is so competitive that a small swing in their favour could go a long way. Furthermore, Haas seem to enjoy Bahrain \u2013 it's where Magnussen pulled off his \"Viking comeback\" in 2022... BARRETTO: Testing has given us a fascinating insight into the pecking order for 2023 \u2013 but the full story is going to be even juicier 8. AlphaTauri\n\nAlphaTauri finished ninth in last year's standings \u2013 can they move up the order this season?\n\nAlphaTauri led the mileage stakes in Bahrain with 456 laps of the circuit that will also host this weekend's season-opener. Yuki Tsunoda and rookie team mate Nyck de Vries clearly encountered no bugs with their AT04, but the team's pace was hard to read as Tsunoda managed a fast flying lap only at the end of the third day \u2013 which might have been a low-fuel quali run. So we haven't had a proper read on the Faenza team's pace, but our preliminary data hints that they're only just above Haas and Williams in the stakes. Again, the same caveats as above apply in this tight midfield scrap. ANALYSIS: How do McLaren, Haas, AlphaTauri and more stack up after pre-season testing in Bahrain? 7. McLaren\n\nNot the ideal start for McLaren, who pushed for P4 in the standings last season\n\nMcLaren were one of the surprises from pre-season testing, and not for the reasons they would have liked. The team in orange seemed to struggle with aerodynamic efficiency and further issues sprung up at the front of the car with their front wheel brows needing strengthening, which hampered rookie Oscar Piastri and team mate Lando Norris. As a result, McLaren managed just 312 laps over the three days and our data put them in the bottom half. Perhaps they didn't get a representative quali or race run in, but it's not a great start for the Woking team.

Alfa Romeo\n\nA brace of red flag-triggering issues aside, Alfa Romeo have cause to smile\n\nAlfa Romeo's Zhou Guanyu topped the timesheets on Day 2 with a run on C5 tyres and it would really be something if they do that again in qualifying this Saturday. It's fair to assume that this was not a lap worth reading too much into and our data backs that up, putting Alfa Romeo in the midfield battle. But there are reasons to be optimstic for Alfa Romeo and fans of Valtteri Bottas and Zhou, because it does look like they've made some improvements over last year. Two significant reliability issues during the three days of testing might be reason for concern, however. WATCH: Jolyon Palmer\u2019s testing takeaways after three busy days in Bahrain 5. Alpine\n\nMore to come from last year's midfield-toppers Alpine?\n\nAlpine were bullish during launch season with their engineers showing off numerous aero changes and talking of a significant decrease in weight, but the team didn't seem to show their hand in testing: there were no blistering glory runs and their long runs were hard to read. New signing Pierre Gasly hinted that there was pace in the A523 but that race simulation on the final day was interrupted by a red flag. So our data put the team that finished fourth in last year's constructors' standings one step lower in this year's pre-season Power Rankings. VOTE: Which of the 10 teams impressed you most in 2023 pre-season testing? 4. Aston Martin\n\nAston Martin turned heads in Bahrain testing\n\nAston Martin's AMR23 looks like a big step up from last year's car, which saw the team finish seventh in the standings. Our data puts them fourth in the rankings before the opening Grand Prix \u2013 is that an outlandish or realistic expectation for Lance Stroll and Fernando Alonso? Well, Haas driver Magnussen and Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner have already pointed at Aston Martin as this year's most-improved in testing. It would be far-fetched to expect a Red Bull-beating display from Aston Martin but long runs and short runs were both favourable over the three days. Fernando Alonso was particularly fast and reserve driver Felipe Drugovich was no slouch as he replaced the injured Stroll in testing. READ MORE: Aston Martin officially confirm Drugovich as Stroll stand-in if Canadian can\u2019t race in Bahrain Grand Prix 3. Mercedes\n\nPerhaps Mercedes have more in the tank \u2013 we'll see how they fare soon\n\nSome predictions have put Mercedes behind Aston Martin but our data hints that they might just hold the advantage over the midfield leaders. The eight-time constructors' champions did have a couple of reliability hiccups during the three days of testing, and as the session unfolded they looked a lot happier about their performance. Day 1 wasn't a disaster for the Silver Arrows but only on Friday and Saturday did Lewis Hamilton and George Russell find their feet in the unconventionally-designed W14. They have made strides over 2022 but they're behind Ferrari in our Power Rankings. Although team Principal Toto Wolff hints that there's more to come... READ MORE: Wolff admits Red Bull and Ferrari look \u2018fast\u2019 \u2013 but says Mercedes are \u2018still hiding\u2019 some pace 2. Ferrari\n\nFerrari's boss said the mood in the Scuderia camp was \"perfect\" after 3 days in Bahrain\n\nFerrari set some competitive times, briefly topping sessions throughout the weekend \u2013 but their rivals Red Bull eclipsed them. Furthermore, our data showed that the team in rosso were around the level of Mercedes and, at times, Aston Martin. Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc did have positive things to say about the balance of the SF-23 but as always, Ferrari kept their cards close to their chest.

            "text": "Whether or not the lower positions in the IndyCar series top 10 standings should be worth more points in the future is a different question.\n\nMore importantly F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali has also come out strongly in the Herta case. Obviously he wants to protect F3 and F2 \u2013 they are part of the business he runs \u2013 but there\u2019s also a fear that if an American is fast-tracked to a licence and then it doesn\u2019t work out, as with the infamous Michael Andretti/McLaren relationship in 1993, then it will actually damage the sport in the USA.\n\nGiven the chorus of disapproval the chances of the FIA making an exception for Herta receded very quickly.\n\nRed Bull hasn\u2019t given up, and Alpine is trying to help out by giving Herta a test in Budapest in its 2021 car next week, although quite what will be achieved by that is unclear.\n\nIf, as we\u2019ve been told by Christian Horner, that Herta is the only driver who could trigger a release for Gasly, that should be the end of it. Liam Lawson, the next Red Bull junior in line and official reserve for the two teams, is apparently not regarded as being ready for promotion to a race seat.\n\nThe other possibility is that Red Bull contradicts Horner\u2019s earlier assertion and takes someone else to replace Gasly. Mick Schumacher\u2019s name had been linked with AlphaTauri, which might have made more sense when Porsche was still lurking in the background, and having a high-profile German in the Red Bull camp would have been an obvious benefit.\n\nIf not Gasly at Alpine, then who?\n\nGasly is still at the top of Alpine\u2019s list, and it\u2019s been made clear that any past personal rivalry between the 2020 Italian GP winner and potential future team mate Esteban Ocon will have to be overcome, should be get the drive.\n\nAlpine has made it clear that it is in no hurry to make a decision, and thus in effect it can wait for the Gasly situation to play out. The risk is that in waiting it might lose other potential candidates.\n\nOne solution is already onboard. Alpine might have lost Piastri, but it still has Jack Doohan, whose stock has been rising recently. The young Aussie responded to suddenly being in the frame for an F1 graduation by showing good speed in recent F2 weekends, even if he\u2019s not had much luck in the actual races, aside from a feature win at Spa. He also took pole at Monza.\n\nHe currently lies fourth in the championship, just 11 points shy of third, but with several drivers close behind. However, a superlicence is a formality for him even if he slips down the order, thanks to past championship results.\n\nAlthough many now see Doohan as favourite for the drive, Alpine has made its open-minded position clear by inviting Nyck de Vries and Antonio Giovinazzi to join the young Australian and Herta at the Budapest test.\n\nDe Vries raised his stock with his brilliant drive to ninth at Monza with Williams, and some would argue that Alpine should have signed him there and then. It remains to be seen whether someone else does take him even before the Alpine test can happen.\n\nGiovinazzi is seen as a safe pair of hands, and one of the few still young but experienced drivers on the sidelines, with 62 starts to his name. His record at Alfa Romeo looks unspectacular, but the car wasn\u2019t always good. He is still highly-regarded, especially by Ferrari, for whom he is test and reserve driver. An FP1 outing at Monza last week, that saw him almost match regular driver Kevin Magnussen on his first outing in a 2022 car, did him no harm.\n\nSchumacher cannot be completely ruled out at Alpine, while Daniel Ricciardo should be an obvious candidate, but his name is not being mentioned.

Indeed Ricciardo\u2019s name isn\u2019t cropping up much in connection with any of the available seats, although he has a firm offer to be reserve at Mercedes next year.\n\nWho will get the 2023 Haas F1 seat?\n\nAnother possibility for Alpine is Nico H\u00fclkenberg, who raced for the Enstone outfit in 2017-19 and knows team principal Otmar Szafnauer well from his Force India days. He could be a good guy to give a one-year deal, pending Gasly becoming available in 2023.\n\nHowever, the German is also linked with Haas as replacement for Schumacher, assuming that the latter\u2019s departure is finally officially confirmed. If the US-owned team wants to have two experienced drivers, he would be a logical choice.

We just have to see what is the best decision.\u201d\n\nGiovinazzi is the other main candidate at Haas, and his Ferrari connections don\u2019t hurt \u2013 although Guenther Steiner has made it clear that Maranello can only advise and not oblige the team to run its favoured driver.

He is likely to do the two obligatory rookie FP1 sessions for the team over the last few races.\n\nWill Williams wait for Sargeant?\n\nThe word at Williams is that there are two main candidates, namely de Vries and the team\u2019s F2 protege, American Logan Sargeant.\n\nThe appeal of bringing the latter into F1 via the traditional European route, and beating Herta to the punch, is obvious.\n\nHe\u2019s won two feature races and had a good first full F2 season, but it\u2019s fallen apart a bit lately, just as he became a serious contender for an F1 seat.

            "title": "What went right and what went wrong for every F1 team in 2022",
            "article_html": "<div><p>The 2022 Formula One season is over. Red Bull took the championship, but all 10 teams had at least one good thing to shout about, as well as moments that didn't go to plan, across the season.</p><p>Here we look at the best and worst of every team's season, in championship order.</p><h2>1. Red Bull</h2><img class=\" lazyload lazyload\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\">Mario Renzi - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images<p><b>What went right:</b> Pretty much everything. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&amp;driverId=4665\">Max Verstappen</a> was on another level this year and looked as good as any dominant champion in F1's recent history, winning a record 15 of the team's 17 victories. Verstappen's ability to continually raise the bar was impressive and it is hard to argue against him being the best driver in F1 right now. With Verstappen on board the team's future looks incredibly bright. The team operated at a top level too. Red Bull out-developed and out-strategised its rivals throughout the year and continually underlined the strength of the whole F1 operation -- head of strategy Hannah Schmitz was one of the heroes of the team's campaign. The world champions had to deal with engine supplier Honda officially withdrawing from F1, but later struck a deal to continue using one of the best power units in F1 until the end of 2025. Early reliability issues threatened the team's championship challenge in the early weeks of the year but once the team was on top of those problems, it never looked back.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> Optics and reputational damage. The team's 2021 budget cap overspend cast a shadow over the achievement of winning both F1 titles for the first time since 2013. Red Bull was hit with a $7 million fine and will lose 10 percent of its aerodynamic testing allowance next year. Red Bull was already due to have the lowest allocation of any team, having won the championship, raising the possibility it could struggle to keep pace with the development of Ferrari and Mercedes next year. Then there was Brazil, where Verstappen refused a simple request to help his dutiful teammate <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&amp;driverId=4472\">Sergio Perez</a> in his bid to finish second in the drivers' championship. It made Verstappen look petulant and disrespectful and, worst of all, made the team look powerless to control their superstar driver. Red Bull took the blame, but the damage was done. Team harmony is now a big question-mark and the whole saga may set up an interesting situation if Verstappen needs Perez's help in a tighter championship fight next season.</p><h2>2. Ferrari</h2><img class=\" lazyload lazyload\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\">Peter J Fox/Getty Images<p><b>What went right:</b> Returning to the front. Ferrari's car was the cream of the crop in winter testing and started with two <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&amp;driverId=5498\">Charles Leclerc</a> wins from three races early on. The team had clearly made good decisions in the preceding year in terms of car design, after two years woefully off the pace following its private settlement with the FIA for running an illegal engine in 2019. Building a more competitive car than the all-conquering Mercedes outfit was a feather in the cap and it did manage to secure second in the championship. Although the season did not end with the championship win many had hoped, Ferrari has set a good baseline for future seasons and is not as far from contention as in previous years.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> Strategy, car reliability, driver errors -- the list is long. Not long after those two early wins, Ferrari's season imploded. The team made many baffling strategy calls and its radio communications with drivers became a source of comedy at the end of the season, with Leclerc especially sounding fed up with things at recent events. Team boss Mattia Binotto infamously declared there was no reason the team couldn't win the final 10 races of the season, only for the team not to win any of them. Binotto's job appears to be hanging by a thread now and it is clear big changes are needed if Ferrari wants to be a champion any time soon. The team cannot shoulder all the blame, though. Leclerc and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&amp;driverId=4686\">Carlos Sainz</a> made their fair share of mistakes at big moments which only worsened the team's woes through the year.</p><h2>3. Mercedes</h2><img class=\" lazyload lazyload\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\">Peter J Fox/Getty Images<p><b>What went right:</b> The team's driver pairing and emergence of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&amp;driverId=5503\">George Russell</a>. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&amp;driverId=4520\">Valtteri Bottas</a>' performances were a weak point of the team in previous years but with Russell at the helm alongside <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&amp;driverId=868\">Lewis Hamilton</a>, the team has two superstar drivers. Mercedes quite comfortably has the best driver lineup on the grid right now. Russell lived up to all expectations and beat Hamilton's points haul over a season -- only the third teammate to do that in 16 years. He scored a memorable first win in Brazil, the team's only victory. Hamilton started slowly but was back to his best by midseason and it is clear the fire is burning within him as much as ever. If Mercedes can build a title-worthy car and avoid internal conflict, it will be a formidable pairing for any team to beat.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> The car. Mercedes' championship challenge seemed over before the season had even started. The W13 featured a radical concept, different to any other car on the grid, and it immediately created problems for the team. The car was known for how it bounced at high speeds earlier in the year -- a phenomenon known as porpoising. It meant Mercedes started on the back foot, which was a fall from grace after eight seasons at the front of the pack. The team managed to solve early problems and developed well over the year, but it was never a legitimate contender for the title. Toto Wolff has vowed to put the troublesome car in the reception of the team's two factories next season to remind employees how difficult it is to win in Formula One.</p><h2>4. Alpine</h2><img class=\" lazyload lazyload\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\">Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images<p><b>What went right:</b> Beating McLaren to fourth. Realistically, this was the best the French team could hope for this year, with F1's top three clearly a step ahead of the rest. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&amp;driverId=4678\">Esteban Ocon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&amp;driverId=348\">Fernando Alonso</a> were two of 2022's in-form drivers and there were only three races Alpine failed to score a point at. With a lot of questions about the long-term vision of the Renault factory outfit, this result was a sign that, whatever might be going wrong behind the scenes, the team is at least on a good path in terms of its car.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> Team management and reliability. It was a bad look for the French team to lose Alonso and Oscar Piastri to rival teams in the space of a week. The handling of mega-talented junior driver Piastri, for so long considered the future of the team, was farcical, while Alonso was happy to take a step down the grid to Aston Martin after Alpine dithered on his contract extension. It seems the in-fighting and mismanagement which has plagued the Renault operation since it returned to F1 in 2016 has not gone away. Although it finished fourth, Alonso regularly called out the team's spotty reliability record and it will need to get on top of this if it wants to continue an upward trajectory without the Spaniard at the helm.</p><h2>5. McLaren</h2><img class=\" lazyload lazyload\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\">ANP via Getty Images<p><b>What went right:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&amp;driverId=5579\">Lando Norris</a>. McLaren extended Norris' F1 contract until 2025 at the start of the season. It will be money well spent. By finishing 'best of the rest', a term Norris said he does not actually like, the British driver was one of the year's standout performers and the only driver outside of the top three teams to score a podium, which he did at Imola. Norris is one of the best long-term prospects in F1 right now. He did not win a race but, unlike his missed opportunity in Sochi last year, McLaren was never in the mix for victory. When Norris gets a competitive car there can be little doubt he will be a contender for victories and championships in future.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&amp;driverId=4510\">Daniel Ricciardo</a> and a car stranded in the midfield. While Norris excelled in one car, Ricciardo floundered in the other, scoring a staggering 82 fewer points than his teammate. CEO Zak Brown cut the Australian's deal short one year early, a decision understandable in the context of Ricciardo's results since joining McLaren in 2021. Ricciardo wasn't the only concern. McLaren came into the season hoping to make the top three a pack of four teams, but it seemed further away from the front this year and never came close to challenging for a win. There has been progress under Brown but this famous F1 team might be stuck in the midfield for a little while yet. The longer that wait goes on, the harder it will be to convince Norris to stay.</p><h2>6. Alfa Romeo</h2><img class=\" lazyload lazyload\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\">Lars Baron/Getty Images<p><b>What went right:</b> Audi, Valtteri Bottas and finishing sixth. Bottas was a superb signing by the Swiss team and the Finn was at the center of the Hinwil operation's best championship result since finishing sixth as Sauber in 2012. Bottas scored 49 of the teams 55 points, showing how valuable that kind of experience can be to a midfield team with a competitive car. Rookie driver <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/racing/driver/_/id/5682/guanyu-zhou\">Zhou Guanyu</a> is unpolished but may have the talent to stay in F1 for a while if he can show progress next year. On top of everything else, Alfa Romeo secured a huge partnership with German manufacturing giants Audi for 2026, which will be a huge boost for the future of a team that has won just one race in its 26 years on the F1 grid. Good times await.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> Reliability. Despite the strong result, Alfa had one of the worst reliability records on the grid. During the European rounds Alfa's cars seemed to hit an issue every weekend and that surely left a huge haul of points on the table across the season. Over the final 12 races the team added just four points to its tally and ended up tied on 55 with Aston Martin. Bottas' fifth-place finish at Imola -- which neither Aston driver could match -- won a tiebreaker, but it shows you how costly those issues might have been. The two cars' starts were also terrible all year, something the drivers put down to clutch issues.</p><h2>7. Aston Martin</h2><img class=\" lazyload lazyload\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\">Dan Istitene - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images<p><b>What went right:</b> Convincing Alonso to join the project. Alonso is exactly the kind of driver Aston Martin needs to achieve Lawrence Stroll's lofty ambitions of running at the front of the grid in a few years. Stroll has shown he is willing to spend big to achieve his goals and this was an indication of how serious he is. Alonso, who joins on a three-year deal, has no issues publicly calling out a team for poor performances or reliability and he might be the driving force the team needs internally to move up the order. He remains one of F1's most talented drivers and, as long as Aston Martin can manage his ego the right way, Alonso will be a huge boost to the team going forward. It is clear he is as fired up as ever, which is always as good thing.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> A lack of competitiveness. Aston Martin's car is still a long way from looking like one that can challenge for anything meaningful in F1.

            "text": "The 2022 Formula One season is over. Red Bull took the championship, but all 10 teams had at least one good thing to shout about, as well as moments that didn't go to plan, across the season.\n\nHere we look at the best and worst of every team's season, in championship order.\n\n1. Red Bull\n\nMario Renzi - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images\n\nWhat went right: Pretty much everything. Max Verstappen was on another level this year and looked as good as any dominant champion in F1's recent history, winning a record 15 of the team's 17 victories. Verstappen's ability to continually raise the bar was impressive and it is hard to argue against him being the best driver in F1 right now. With Verstappen on board the team's future looks incredibly bright. The team operated at a top level too. Red Bull out-developed and out-strategised its rivals throughout the year and continually underlined the strength of the whole F1 operation -- head of strategy Hannah Schmitz was one of the heroes of the team's campaign. The world champions had to deal with engine supplier Honda officially withdrawing from F1, but later struck a deal to continue using one of the best power units in F1 until the end of 2025. Early reliability issues threatened the team's championship challenge in the early weeks of the year but once the team was on top of those problems, it never looked back.\n\nWhat went wrong: Optics and reputational damage. The team's 2021 budget cap overspend cast a shadow over the achievement of winning both F1 titles for the first time since 2013. Red Bull was hit with a $7 million fine and will lose 10 percent of its aerodynamic testing allowance next year. Red Bull was already due to have the lowest allocation of any team, having won the championship, raising the possibility it could struggle to keep pace with the development of Ferrari and Mercedes next year. Then there was Brazil, where Verstappen refused a simple request to help his dutiful teammate Sergio Perez in his bid to finish second in the drivers' championship. It made Verstappen look petulant and disrespectful and, worst of all, made the team look powerless to control their superstar driver. Red Bull took the blame, but the damage was done. Team harmony is now a big question-mark and the whole saga may set up an interesting situation if Verstappen needs Perez's help in a tighter championship fight next season.\n\n2. Ferrari\n\nPeter J Fox/Getty Images\n\nWhat went right: Returning to the front. Ferrari's car was the cream of the crop in winter testing and started with two Charles Leclerc wins from three races early on. The team had clearly made good decisions in the preceding year in terms of car design, after two years woefully off the pace following its private settlement with the FIA for running an illegal engine in 2019. Building a more competitive car than the all-conquering Mercedes outfit was a feather in the cap and it did manage to secure second in the championship. Although the season did not end with the championship win many had hoped, Ferrari has set a good baseline for future seasons and is not as far from contention as in previous years.\n\nWhat went wrong: Strategy, car reliability, driver errors -- the list is long. Not long after those two early wins, Ferrari's season imploded. The team made many baffling strategy calls and its radio communications with drivers became a source of comedy at the end of the season, with Leclerc especially sounding fed up with things at recent events. Team boss Mattia Binotto infamously declared there was no reason the team couldn't win the final 10 races of the season, only for the team not to win any of them. Binotto's job appears to be hanging by a thread now and it is clear big changes are needed if Ferrari wants to be a champion any time soon. The team cannot shoulder all the blame, though. Leclerc and Carlos Sainz made their fair share of mistakes at big moments which only worsened the team's woes through the year.\n\n3. Mercedes\n\nPeter J Fox/Getty Images\n\nWhat went right: The team's driver pairing and emergence of George Russell. Valtteri Bottas' performances were a weak point of the team in previous years but with Russell at the helm alongside Lewis Hamilton, the team has two superstar drivers. Mercedes quite comfortably has the best driver lineup on the grid right now. Russell lived up to all expectations and beat Hamilton's points haul over a season -- only the third teammate to do that in 16 years. He scored a memorable first win in Brazil, the team's only victory. Hamilton started slowly but was back to his best by midseason and it is clear the fire is burning within him as much as ever. If Mercedes can build a title-worthy car and avoid internal conflict, it will be a formidable pairing for any team to beat.\n\nWhat went wrong: The car. Mercedes' championship challenge seemed over before the season had even started. The W13 featured a radical concept, different to any other car on the grid, and it immediately created problems for the team. The car was known for how it bounced at high speeds earlier in the year -- a phenomenon known as porpoising. It meant Mercedes started on the back foot, which was a fall from grace after eight seasons at the front of the pack. The team managed to solve early problems and developed well over the year, but it was never a legitimate contender for the title. Toto Wolff has vowed to put the troublesome car in the reception of the team's two factories next season to remind employees how difficult it is to win in Formula One.\n\n4. Alpine\n\nJakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nWhat went right: Beating McLaren to fourth. Realistically, this was the best the French team could hope for this year, with F1's top three clearly a step ahead of the rest. Esteban Ocon and Fernando Alonso were two of 2022's in-form drivers and there were only three races Alpine failed to score a point at. With a lot of questions about the long-term vision of the Renault factory outfit, this result was a sign that, whatever might be going wrong behind the scenes, the team is at least on a good path in terms of its car.\n\nWhat went wrong: Team management and reliability. It was a bad look for the French team to lose Alonso and Oscar Piastri to rival teams in the space of a week. The handling of mega-talented junior driver Piastri, for so long considered the future of the team, was farcical, while Alonso was happy to take a step down the grid to Aston Martin after Alpine dithered on his contract extension. It seems the in-fighting and mismanagement which has plagued the Renault operation since it returned to F1 in 2016 has not gone away. Although it finished fourth, Alonso regularly called out the team's spotty reliability record and it will need to get on top of this if it wants to continue an upward trajectory without the Spaniard at the helm.\n\n5. McLaren\n\nANP via Getty Images\n\nWhat went right: Lando Norris. McLaren extended Norris' F1 contract until 2025 at the start of the season. It will be money well spent. By finishing 'best of the rest', a term Norris said he does not actually like, the British driver was one of the year's standout performers and the only driver outside of the top three teams to score a podium, which he did at Imola. Norris is one of the best long-term prospects in F1 right now. He did not win a race but, unlike his missed opportunity in Sochi last year, McLaren was never in the mix for victory. When Norris gets a competitive car there can be little doubt he will be a contender for victories and championships in future.\n\nWhat went wrong: Daniel Ricciardo and a car stranded in the midfield. While Norris excelled in one car, Ricciardo floundered in the other, scoring a staggering 82 fewer points than his teammate. CEO Zak Brown cut the Australian's deal short one year early, a decision understandable in the context of Ricciardo's results since joining McLaren in 2021. Ricciardo wasn't the only concern. McLaren came into the season hoping to make the top three a pack of four teams, but it seemed further away from the front this year and never came close to challenging for a win. There has been progress under Brown but this famous F1 team might be stuck in the midfield for a little while yet. The longer that wait goes on, the harder it will be to convince Norris to stay.\n\n6. Alfa Romeo\n\nLars Baron/Getty Images\n\nWhat went right: Audi, Valtteri Bottas and finishing sixth. Bottas was a superb signing by the Swiss team and the Finn was at the center of the Hinwil operation's best championship result since finishing sixth as Sauber in 2012. Bottas scored 49 of the teams 55 points, showing how valuable that kind of experience can be to a midfield team with a competitive car. Rookie driver Zhou Guanyu is unpolished but may have the talent to stay in F1 for a while if he can show progress next year. On top of everything else, Alfa Romeo secured a huge partnership with German manufacturing giants Audi for 2026, which will be a huge boost for the future of a team that has won just one race in its 26 years on the F1 grid. Good times await.\n\nWhat went wrong: Reliability. Despite the strong result, Alfa had one of the worst reliability records on the grid. During the European rounds Alfa's cars seemed to hit an issue every weekend and that surely left a huge haul of points on the table across the season. Over the final 12 races the team added just four points to its tally and ended up tied on 55 with Aston Martin. Bottas' fifth-place finish at Imola -- which neither Aston driver could match -- won a tiebreaker, but it shows you how costly those issues might have been. The two cars' starts were also terrible all year, something the drivers put down to clutch issues.\n\n7. Aston Martin\n\nDan Istitene - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images\n\nWhat went right: Convincing Alonso to join the project. Alonso is exactly the kind of driver Aston Martin needs to achieve Lawrence Stroll's lofty ambitions of running at the front of the grid in a few years. Stroll has shown he is willing to spend big to achieve his goals and this was an indication of how serious he is. Alonso, who joins on a three-year deal, has no issues publicly calling out a team for poor performances or reliability and he might be the driving force the team needs internally to move up the order. He remains one of F1's most talented drivers and, as long as Aston Martin can manage his ego the right way, Alonso will be a huge boost to the team going forward. It is clear he is as fired up as ever, which is always as good thing.\n\nWhat went wrong: A lack of competitiveness. Aston Martin's car is still a long way from looking like one that can challenge for anything meaningful in F1. Stroll has invested heavily in a new factory opposite the Silverstone circuit but it is only just coming online and was completed too late to have an impact on the 2022 campaign. The most worrying thing this year will be how far behind the Alpine/McLaren battle Aston Martin found itself, with Sebastian Vettel and Lance Stroll often fighting at the lower end of the order in qualifying and races. Aston Martin is a long way away from proving it is a team moving in the right direction.\n\n8. Haas\n\nPeter J Fox/Getty Images\n\nWhat went right: The return of Kevin Magnussen and a new title sponsor. The team's future seemed uncertain when it cut ties with Uralkali at the start of the year, but it bounced back superbly. K-Mag's return was a great sporting comeback story and showed why the team is now going for the experienced Nico Hulkenberg over the error-prone Mick Schumacher -- experience is key.

The team will hopefully be able to turn its attentions to a return to the midfield pack in future years.\n\nWhat went wrong: Money and Mick. In the period between Uralkali and MoneyGram, it was clear how strapped for cash Haas was this year. The team had to delay a planned upgrade midway through the year and it slipped down the order as other teams developed their cars. Haas' cause was not helped by Schumacher's expensive crashes in the opening races, which left them worried about running out of spare parts at some races. Schumacher showed glimpses of form after that but ultimately not enough to keep his job. Although MoneyGram is a boost, Haas lost ground to several midfield rivals in the spell without a title partner in a crucial year in this new generation of cars - the first year sets the baseline for what is to come.\n\n9. AlphaTauri\n\nClive Mason - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images\n\nWhat went right: Not a lot.

            "text": "F1' all-new era kicked off in 2022, with overhauled technical regulations that led to closer racing, more overtaking and plenty of drama. But which drivers hit the ground running when the new cars hit the track? It\u2019s time for an all-in-one comparison of this year\u2019s team mates... First, some ground rules for our scoring: Final grid slots have been used to determine the qualifying battle outcome\n\nFinal grid positions are counted for \u2018Highest Grid Position\u2019, not the initial order from qualifying\n\nMechanical failures and/or collisions that are registered as classified finishes have been counted as DNFs here Red Bull\n\nMax Verstappen was credited by Red Bull chiefs for stepping it up another gear as he charged to a second world championship, having taken an incredible 15 wins and 17 podium finishes from the 22 races staged across the globe in 2022. When compared to team mate Sergio Perez, that meant 13 more victories and six more podiums for the most dominant intra-team race day head-to-head of the season \u2013 only heightened by the margin of 149 points between them. It was a similar story in qualifying (18 to four for Verstappen). WATCH: The anatomy of Max Verstappen \u2013 What does it take to become an F1 champion? While Perez consistently racked up solid points, Verstappen\u2019s relentless winning ways (after two costly DNFs early in the season) did the damage, with the Dutchman finishing no more than two races in a row off the top step and triumphing in nine of the last 11 Grands Prix. Ferrari\n\nCharles Leclerc was the king of qualifying in 2022 as he bagged nine pole positions at the wheel of Ferrari\u2019s undeniably fast F1-75, two clear of double champion Verstappen and six ahead of team mate Carlos Sainz. Unfortunately for the Scuderia, this underlying pace often went missing on race day through strategic blunders, reliability issues and driver mistakes \u2013 Sainz suffering a record-equalling six retirements, and two from the first four races.

However, with 62 more points, Leclerc secured a career-best P2 in the drivers\u2019 standings, while Sainz had to settle for P5. Mercedes\n\nOf the top three teams in the constructors\u2019 standings, the intra-team battle at Mercedes was the closest of them all, with little to separate seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton and new arrival George Russell. In qualifying, and after some early-season experiments, Hamilton found the edge to end the campaign with a record of 13 to nine, while Russell took race days 12 to 10.

Alpine\n\nAnother tight team mate scrap \u2013 and one that boiled over towards the end of the season with a pair of dramatic clashes during the F1 Sprint in Sao Paulo \u2013 involved Alpine pair Fernando Alonso and Esteban Ocon. But there was an important side note come the final chequered flag of 2022 in Abu Dhabi, with Alonso \u2013 like Sainz \u2013 suffering six DNFs (five due to technical problems and one due to collision damage).

McLaren\n\nLando Norris delivered the most dominant intra-team qualifying head-to-head record in 2022 with a score of 20 to two over Daniel Ricciardo, who leaves McLaren this winter to take up a reserve role at former team Red Bull. Whether it was a case of Norris excelling, Ricciardo struggling or a bit of both, the young Briton also stamped his authority on race days, finishing ahead 16 to five and scoring 85 more points.

Alfa Romeo\n\nAlfa Romeo were one of the surprise packages at the start of F1\u2019s rules reset as their trim C42 hit the ground running; Zhou Guanyu scoring on his Grand Prix debut and Valtteri Bottas taking points from seven of the first nine races.
